Part 1: Icy Comrade

TIME: 09:33 ERST
DATE: War Day 880/4 Noneus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Fort Defense Base Annex, Canterlot

The entire General Staff was here, along with all the personnel from my attached units. The entire NEIGHTO Command Advisory Group. That's.. over ninety people. Plus, Admiral Iris Emerald, Lord Sombra, Queen Ember, and Prince Blueblood were all here, as well.

I looked at all of them talking, and it struck me.

At the start of this war, I only REALLY knew a bit over a dozen. Now? I had almost two full companies of FRIENDS. Real friends. Friends that had all shed blood with each other, were willing to kill to protect each other.

A few had been lost along the way. Gone on to higher duties, like Sunshine, or.. lost in battle, like Berry Punch.

K: "Everyone." I nodded to them. "We need to discuss what we're going to attempt next - the Rainbow of Light." I gestured.

Twilight: "Thanks to the Vulpines, we know.. almost exactly where it is. Within a few kilometers, at least. It's a lot better than trying to scour the coldest, most inhospitable, and tallest mountains on Equus for possibly months." She shrugged. "The only problem is, even if the location isn't exactly in Griffon territory, it's VERY close, and we may even need to transit through their lands in order to get where we need to go."

K: "Fortunately, we have.. limited diplomatic contact with them. Starlight is on a mission over there right now, but.." I sighed.

Applejack: "We either need'm 'ta join us, 're stay neutral 'n give us right'a passage." She nodded.

Katrina: "One thing I'm worried about." She spoke up, shrugging.

K: "Go ahead, Kat." I nodded back to her.

Katrina: "I think we discussed the possibility of another civilization arising and falling around 2,500 years ago. We also know that the survivors of the Empire of Harmony left the region - and the remnants are around Byrnta." She pointed and wagged her finger. "What if they took the Rainbow with them?"

Big Mac: "It's possible, I 'spose.." He nodded, looking at Gaze and Norfy.

Gaze: "Mmmm.. dinnae got no old tales from me Gram-Gram t'help wi' that." He shrugged. "We dinnae even know one'a our ancestors was a Hero Pony."

Bright Eyes: "Well, NOW, at least.. we have the technology to make this work." She nodded. "We can get a team up there, and sustain them, despite the cold."

Devils: "I'd like to take my team with, General. We're not especially cold weather resistant, but we ARE moreso than ponies." He nodded to Havoc.

K: "Yeah.. well.. your country signed the NEIGHTO Accords, so, you're in. I'll want to meet your team, though." I nodded.

Havoc: "Us, too. We ARE suited to cold weather!" He panted and thumped his tail.

Forest Spirit: "Problem is.. like he said.. we're NOT." He nodded. "We need.. an expert in Arctic conditions." And shrugged, looking at Norfy.

Norfy: "I'm an Ice Mage, and yes, I do better in the cold.. but.." He frowned.

Chief Slapshot: "Ah, sir.." She stepped up, with the team bringing us refreshments.

K: "Chief." I nodded to her.

Chief Slapshot: "I.. overheard." She nodded to the AF-SP ponies under her command, pulling security, as our team was just too big to fit into the Conference Room at the Palace.

K: "What's up, Chief?" I gestured, accepting a coffee from one of the kitchen staff.

Chief Slapshot: "Welll... I think I know just the pony you need." She nodded firmly. "2nd Fighter Squadron. 2nd Lieutenant Blizzardly Snowbound. She's.. well, she loves flying.. and she always goes on about being raised in northern Whinnysota.." She pursed her lips. "..and going out in the cold, a lot, in winter to go.. uhm.. ice fishing?"

K: "Oh?" My grin started small and grew ten miles wide. "Ice fishing, eh?"

Now, I have mentioned before that I'm Chicagoan by birth. Well, for those that don't "get it," there's a bit of a rivalry between Chicagoans and Illinoisians in general, and our northern neighbors in Wisconsin. Ice Fishing is a sport both states share, northern Illinois especially.

I've been out on The Ice in Lake Michigan a few times. Ice Fished twice. Once properly, the other from a dock. There IS a difference.

One key factor? YOU. WILL. FREEZE. YOUR. BALLS. OFF. Unless you LOVE the cold, LOVE getting drunk and talking with your Bros, OR love the taste of winter-caught fish, no human in their right mind would go.

And she LOVES it?

Norfy: "Ooo.. did that a couple times out on the Lake." He smirked. "It gets mighty cold."

K: "...oh, Norfy, dear friend.. I KNOW!" I turned and let him see my grin, then turned back to Slapshot. "I gotta question for you."

Chief Slapshot: "Yes, sir?" She nodded.

K: "Why.. this?" I pointed to her uniform. "You're a Unicorn in an Air Force Ground Combat assignment." I gestured to her. "And you're not exactly.." I nodded to Big Mac. "..built like a brick."

Chief Slapshot: "I wanted to do my part." She stated, firmly, then shook her head. "All my life I've been told that because I'm a Unicorn, and built like I am, that I can't TAKE it.. that I'm not cut out for physical stuff." She puffed up. "A load of Wet Hay, sir, and I've been determined to prove that since I was a Filly."

K: "Think you can hack it as my Air Force Security Liasion?" I glanced at everyone else, who were all looking at her.

Chief Slapshot: "..WHAT?!" She blinked.

K: "You said you wanted to prove yourself." I nodded. "I need a permanent Air Force Liasion besides Dash.." I looked over at Spitfire. "..since Spitfire is being promoted."

Spitfire: "W-WHAT?!" Her turn to be stunned.

Twilight: "K had me go interview the senior squadron commanders and base commanders.. there were very few that didn't ask for you, Spitfire." She nodded slowly.

Spitfire: "K.. you can't be serious!" She stood fully.

K: "The other senior officers asked." I shrugged. "Even Aero's daughter.." I looked down. "..I remember when I asked him on Carousel Island if he was prepared to let his daughter see him die in this war. Or, he, her." I gestured a bit. "It happened. It's unfortunate, but this is war. And we need our best to lead us to a successful ending." I paced over to her, and pulled out a small box with a Celestia Sun in it, opened it, and handed it to her. "Air Chief Marshal Spitfire."

She blushed.. bowed her head, and accepted the box.

Spitfire: "I accept." She nodded.

Slapshot: "Me, too." She nodded, firmly, looking to Spitfire. "Don't worry, Marshal. I'll keep our General safe." She extended her hoof, and they shook on it.

K: "Alright, you two - your first job is to bring me Blizzardly." I nodded.

Slapshot: "Not a problem, sir." She nodded.

K: "Just K." I grinned.

Cosmic: "Yeah, we're all friends here." He gestured.

Sunset: "No kidding!" She giggled. "I've never had better friends.. or.. family.. sorta.." She hugged Twilight.

Twilight: "Sometimes, family isn't who you're born to." She nodded.

Applejack: "Heck, yeah!" She beamed.

Slapshot: "Thanks.. everyone." She smiled brightly, and headed off with Spitfire to get us our new team member.

Meanwhile, I had to do the one thing I hated the most - wait. Wait for Starlight to try and work her magic of negotiation with the Griffons. And hope for a positive outcome.

Part 2: Warm Ice

LOCATION: Fort Defense Base Annex, General Staff Headquarters Area, Canterlot

I was going over some reports of border activity, and evidence that.. well.. to be honest, our border was as porous as chicken wire.

Spitfire and Slapshot were on their way with Blizzardly. I hoped she'd be a good addition..

I was also becoming acquainted with Seven's team. Unlike him, they were all Native Born Foxes. He'd been training with them for about seven months, and if King Solarenski's testimony was anything to go by, they were professionals.

Blizzardly (From the Hall): "..and I just can't wait to MEET him! I've heard all kinds of things-" She entered the door, escorted by Spitfire and Slapshot. "Ah! General K!" She saluted immediately. "Lieutenant Snowbound, reporting as requested."

K: "At-ease." I nodded, and saluted back. "Slapshot, make sure you get your equipment sorted and moved to the General Staff Barracks." I nodded to her. "How was the trip from Baleston?"

Blizzardly: "Just fine, sir." She nodded, a crisp chipperness to her voice. "Marshal Spitfire said you needed me.. more because I know the Arctic weather." She shrugged.

K: "I also need a full-time pilot. Twilight's been instated as Prime Minister. I mean, she'll be coming with a lot, but still, when she isn't, I'd rather have a friend as our pilot, than some random Pony." I nodded to Spitfire. "Not that I don't trust the people in uniform, just that I'd rather have one on staff."

Blizzardly: "Yes, sir." She nodded. "I'm rated on the F/A-1 and C-1 both."

K: "Good." I nodded. "And, call me K. If you're on my staff, you're a friend."

Blizz: "Only if you call me Blizz, sir. Ah.. K." She nodded.

K: "Awesome." I shrugged, and stood up. "For the time being, I want you to meet-and-greet the rest of the staff - Slapshot, you, too. Get to know them better. We'll be in the thick of it soon enough, you'll have to get comfortable with ground combat."

Blizz: "You bet, K." She beamed a grin. "Come on, Slapshot.. let's go meet our new friends."

Slapshot: "Sounds good!" She nodded to me.

K: "Oh, Slapshot, you're promoted to Air Corporal. I have a personal policy that everyone be at least an OR-7." I gestured.

Slapshot: "Oh! Thank you, sir. Ah.. K." She grinned, just a bit uneasy.

K: "Alright, I'll catch you two later." I shrugged. "I have to go see the Princesses."

Blizz: "This seems like a great group of friends!" She giggled, in a chipper manner. "I can't wait!"

With that, I was off. If we were going to get anywhere with the Griffon Kingdom and get the permission we needed, we'd better be ready the minute we got word.

Blizz would be an interesting addition. I'd have to see how well they worked out, whether I'd have them on the team permanently.

LOCATION: Royal Palace, Canterlot

Going in to see Celestia, I just kinda gave her a hug as I came over to her table in her quarters.

Celestia: "Thank you for covering for me." She drooped a bit. "I don't know what came over me."

K: "Everyone has their limits, Cel. Everyone. Even you." I nodded. "We had it handled. I had a feeling the Sultanate was doing this as a misdirection - I'm pretty certain they're entirely in league with Tirek at this point. We need to try and get the other non-aligned nations and races to help, if we can. The more bodies we can throw at him, the fewer casualties everyone takes." I shrugged.

Celestia: "You have a point." She nodded.

K: "Still no word from Starlight?" I tilted my head.

Celestia: "None." She sighed.

K: "I'm going to take two more days, then I'm heading for the border with my Rainbow of Light expedition. I won't initiate operations until the Griffons give their approval." I shrugged again. "But, I'll do what I can to expedite things as best as possible."

Celestia: "Wise." She shrugged with a smile. "As expected."

K: "Mm. You better, now? We gave you a few days' rest." I nodded to her.

Celestia: "Yes. I'm.. I'm going to carry that trauma for a long time, but.." She looked up and nuzzled me. "At least I know I have.. actual real friends.. not just subjects.. willing to help me when I need it."

K: "Any time, Cel." I nodded to her.

Celestia: "Hm!" She grinned. "And.. now.. about you constructing a Government.."

K: "Military Juntas on Earth do it all the time - usually without my pure intentions, but there have been cases where the military has taken over the civilian government, created a new one, and it turned out okay." I shrugged. "I was in a similar position - the Civilian Government had more or less been disabled, I was the highest ranked military officer in the capital at the time, and even though I'd been temporarily relieved of duty, I still had my effective rank. In my judgment, a civilian government was needed. Right now. And we'd already discussed handing that over to Twilight.. Raven was a happy coincidence."

Celestia: "You really think Raven can be our official Secretary of State?" She blinked.

K: "Cel, she's been in the background the last four years.. she's been there, seen our strategy meetings, taken minutes from them, read every report, learned by secondary exposure every lesson I've tried to teach. I'm only sorry I didn't jump in and start grooming her for the position the minute we started talking Civilian Government." I shrugged. "Which.. is why I want to leave Twilight here. The war has dragged on for nearly three years, now. The people are starting to have real friciton between the needs of the war, and the needs of themselves. I want both Raven and Twilight to go to each State and help the State Governors arrange and create local governments that aren't merely appointed or selected ponies. If something happens to you, me, Luna, and Twilight - just four people - the country would fall apart. We need to start at the ground level. Each State creating their own State Legislature. Elected officials. According to the plan I laid out."

Celestia: "Yes, you.. revised it so that the Senate is selected from each County, appointed by the County Board to represent that county's affairs. And Representatives are from geographic districts drawn up along both cultural and geographic lines." She shrugged her wings.

K: "Exactly. I mean, I know, Ponyville has more in common with Canterlot, than perhaps Princesston, but Representatives should represent the people, and Senators the interests of the next lowest level of Governance, so that both the needs of the individual, and the needs of the smaller governmental organs, are addressed. A Representative can tell you there's a flooding stream. A Senator can tell you the county has no money for flood control." I shrugged and gestured.

Celestia: "Which makes perfect sense." She nodded. "Who will you take in her place?"

K: "Moon Dancer." I nodded firmly. "She has the knowledge, she volunteered to help, and she NEEDS to be pulled out of her social shell."

Celestia: "I understand she's been spending the last several years in isolation, doing professional transcriptions.."

K: "Indeed. She knows her stuff. She needs field experience." I looked over, hearing a knock.

Blizz: "..ah, K!" She trotted on in. "Sorry, sir, Your Highness. I overheard all of this.. I like this idea." She nodded. "Think I could run for office when the war's over?"

K: "Do you think you can represent the interests of those that would vote for you?" I nodded back.

Blizz: "I do! I really do." She beamed. "Ah, anyway.. Rainbow Dash sent me. She wanted to know if we needed to be getting ready to leave. The Elements seem to think you're about to.." She shrugged.

K: "They know me well. Two days. Start making preparations. Have Sunset contact the Crystal Kingdom Air Navy - we need the airship fleet. And send Vy and Octavia to fetch Moon Dancer." I nodded to her.

And soon.. we would see about the Rainbow of Light, one way or another.

Part 3: Working Class

TIME: 07:53 ERST
DATE: War Day 882/6 Noneus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Fort Defense Base Annex, General Staff Headquarters Area, Canterlot

I was assembling my team, now. The Elements, Moon Dancer, Havoc's Canidan Rangers, a squad from Seven Devils' Special Forces Squadron, Radio Active, Dawn Earlylight, Dusty Dunes, Dr. Allcome, Sweetheart, Katrina, Gorcat, Slapshot, and the lads - Norfy, Gaze, and Cosmic.

47 total troops. I felt like I was off by one..

SFC Olivine Ellva: "General K!" She trotted right in to the prep room, and saluted.

Olive green, Pegasus pony, Equestrian Royal Army uniform, Sergeant First Class rank pin, Engineer Corps epaulette border.

K: "I am indeed." I saluted back to her. "What's the deal, Soldier?"

SFC Olivine Ellva: "Sergeant First Class Olivine Ellva, General K. Equestrian Royal Army Corps of Engineers, 1st Chemical Troops Regiment." She nodded and handed me her personnel folder.

I took a look at it, then realized she didn't have a transfer request form in there.. or, really, anything resembling that. The 1st Chemcial Troops were based at Fort Cardinal, New Jersey. Her accent is.. Atlantic Coast, I'd say Connecticut Middle Class.

K: "I don't see a transfer form in here, Sergeant." I smirked a little.

SFC Olivine Ellva: "You won't find one, sir. I'm actually on leave." She nodded sharply, and smiled a little. "I've been trying to find a way to get on your staff since I joined the Chemical Troops."

K: "Ohhh..? Cheeky, aren't you?" I smirked and motioned for Applejack to come over. "My wife, Applejack. Hun? This.. very determined soldier from the Chemical Troops.. took leave just to corner me and try to get on the Staff."

Applejack: "Whul, if that jes' don't beat all!" She giggled a bit. "Welcome to th' party!" She stuck out her hoof.

They shook on it, and Olivine nodded firmly.

K: "Explain." I nodded to her.

Olivine: "I have a skill that's very unique. Before the war, I was a perfumist. I made my own, and they were in rather high demand. I already know Miss Rarity - we met, once, at the same client's house. My skill is the ability to extend my Pegasus ability of cloud manipulation.. into extracting only very specific particles from them. Scents, General. Concentrated scents. And in a chemical cloud..?" She lead on.

K: "..you can extract the poison from it." I grinned and nodded. "Leaving only clean air and a toxic sludge."

Olivine: "Indeed, General." She smiled, proudly, just a bit.

K: "You're in. Get some Cold Weather Gear, you're joining the expedition to get the Rainbow of Light. My team picks its own weapons and gear. Go get whatever you need." I patted her shoulder. "And realize, this is the most combat-est assignment in the entire military."

Olivine: "Yes, sir! I know that, sir.. that's why I wanted in." She smirked a bit.

Applejack: "Aw, shucks, hun. We don't stand too much on formality, here. Call 'm K, and jes call me Applejack. C'mon back after you get yer-"

She deposited her entire duffel bag and two suitcases in front of her.

She was, indeed, prepared.

Gorcat: "OH! More new blood!" He stuck out his claw. "Gorcat."

Olivine: "Olivine Ellva. Chemical Troops." She shook hoof-and-claw with him.

Gorcat: "Nice t'meet'cha. Come on, I'll help you get squared away. Nice t'have another Winger on the team!" He grinned broadly, and escorted her towards the group.

Applejack: "Mmm.. she's a real go-getter, hun. I k'n see it now. She'll be makin' Officer b'fore too long." She nodded.

K: "A big part of me hopes she doesn't have that kind of time, and she can go back to making perfume." I frowned a bit, waving to the newly pregnant Kiwi Spritz, helping her man get ready.

Applejack: "Sho'nuff, hun. I feels the same." She slid into me, and nuzzled gently. "So's you c'n come back t'the farm an' be a simple apple farmer th' rest'a yer life."

K: "And pizza maker." I smirked.

Applejack: "Durn straight." She sighed, wistfully.

We gathered our gear together, and follwing Blizz's instructions, made certain we had extra of certain things. Following my own instructions, the weapons were all "winterized" - that is, all the parts were wiped clear of oil, which, in extremely low temperatures, can freeze either in whole or part, and sieze up the weapon.

With everything assembled, we listened to an instructional sort-of seminar by Blizz, going over cold weather survival, and tips to make oneself more comfortable, including bringing beeswax sticks to keep exposed flesh protected (we'd call it Chapstick), how to keep one's hoofboots secure, things like that. Some of it, I already knew, growing up where I did, but I have to admit, she dropped a few tips I hadn't thought of.

Olivine proved her worth absolutely immediately, too. Right after the seminar, she made her way to Canterlot University's chemistry lab, and invented the Chemical Hoof (Hand) Warmer, based on known theories of exothermic oxidization of iron.. something she picked up on when Blizz mentioned they used naphtha hoof warmers out on the ice, but had to be careful with them, because of the intense heat. The general theories about it, she'd learned in Chemical Troops training, the syllabus being written by Chemical Lens.

In just a few hours, by recruiting chemistry students, she managed to sew a few dozen silk pouches with the dry chemicals in them, and distributed them among the team. Not bad for a first timer!


TIME: 17:12 ERST

I looked over the gear that was set out in the General Staff Equipment Bay, each with the respective pony's Cutie Mark on it, or for the Canids and Vulpes, their names.

Sunset: "This.. this is really my first honest mission." She nodded a bit.

K: "You're trained, now." I patted her shoulder. "And now, you're really going to fulfill your role as the Element of Magic."

Sunset: "Yes." She nodded firmly. "I won't let.. I won't let anyone down." She looked up to me. "Thank you, Kay. Without you.. helping me.." She looked down again.

K: "You're healing, Sunset." I looked towards the gear racks. "What happened to you, because of all of this, is absolutely insane. We've all had close shaves with trauma in this war. Yours was.. no less injurious.. and very personal."

Sunset: "Yeah." She smiled a little, though. "At least I have a better family, now." And thumped against my leg. "Plus, I've got you." She looked me right in the eyes. "Worst comes to worst.. you can always take me back to Colorado."

Applejack: "Mmm.. I better either be DEAD or COMIN' WITH.. sugar." She slid up behind and OVER Sunset like a murderous, jealous ninja.. and nipped her ear.

Sunset: *Titter* "Mmm.." She leaned her head back. "..jealous I can please your man in ways you can't?"

Applejack: *Lust-dripping* "Aw, sugah.. I'm only gon' be jealous if'n I cain't git mah wifely share..?" She glared at me. "..grab 'is legs."

Sunset: "Ooo.. you're on!" She licked her lips as Applejack dismounted, and the two of them slunk towards me like a pair of skulking cats..

Gaze: "Oi, suh." He nodded to me, getting some tea from the kettle in the HQ Kitchenette.

Me? I was up early, and trying to work the kinks out. Dressed only in my pants and boots, I was trying to get some stretching in.

Gaze: "Rough night with the missus?" He smirked.

K: "..and Sunset." I shrugged.

Gaze: "OI, K!" He beamed. "Noice." He looked down at his tea, then up. "This's gonna be a real pisser, ain't it?"

K: "Yeah. That kind of cold, I've experienced only once. It's going to get so mind numbingly cold, you will probably be in pain. We go high enough, you'll have problems getting enough oxygen, and you'll feel and act drunk. All of this is going to wear on you, day after day.. it could break you. It's broken some pretty tough humans, in the past." I explained.

Gaze: "Still.. th' Rainbow'a Light.." He swished his tea in his cup. "..we git that, we c'n beat Tirek. We c'n think aboot endin' this war."

K: "Yeah." I nodded slowly.

Gaze: "We been through'a whole bunch, K.." He nodded a bit. "..n'I'd go through a bunch more." He smiled a bit.

K: "Our wives. Kids. Friends." I nodded back to him.

Gaze: "Ye kno' it, K." He gave me a one-arm hug. "Bestest friends."

K: "I know if I don't make it, you'll look after them." I smiled.

Gaze: "Aye, an' same." He beamed a grin.

Even though many campaigns would no doubt take place between now and the end, the idea that we can get the real Silver Bullet that can destroy Triek once and for all? It would be worth the suffering we'd endure. The bitter, stinging cold. The oxygen deprivation.

Any injury we took, would be worth it, if we could get it.

Part 4: Griffoned the Brush-Off

TIME: 09:22 ERST
DATE: War Day 885/9 Noneus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Aboard HCMAS Enterprise, 4nmi from Griffon Kingdom Border

Freshly commissioned and on her Maiden voyage, was the Enterprise, under direct command of Sky Captain Jade Notch, with Sky Admiral Iris Emerald commanding the task force (Enterprise, Centaur, Swiftsure, Superb, XY-3102, XY-3103). Jade's old bridge crew were aboard.

Lieutenant Commander Youle Tide: "We're holding station, sirs and ma'ams."

Sombra: "We have yet to receive word from Starlight." He shrugged.

Admiral Emerald: "Mmm. What do we do, K?" She nodded to me.

K: "Try sending a radio signal to the Griffon Kingdom, see if we get a response. Voice and Morse Code. Identify our party as the NEIGHTO General Staff, and request to speak with an official." I shrugged.

LT Cobson Coppers: "Aye, sir." They turned back to their station and made with the signals.

Sombra: "I hope nothing unfortunate has befallen dear Starlight." He frowned.

Moon Dancer: "I-I.. don't think it would. Griffons aren't usually known for mistreating diplomatic missions." She shrugged. "K.. I'm still not sure I'm up for this."

K: "You'll be fine." I nodded.

LT Cobson Coppers: "Sir, a radio signal from the Griffon capital. They're requesting the NEIGHTO Supreme Allied Commander and his party.. head for the Capital.. and coordinates follow." He looked down, then up. "They insist you come unarmed."

Sombra: "..whereas, walking right into a trap with no weapons.." He snorted a bit.

K: "Distance to the Capital?" I queried.

LT Cobson Coppers: "47 kilometers." He nodded.

K: "Ergh.. they expecting us to walk that whole distance?" I shrugged. "No matter. Have the XY's dock with Enterprise and take the machine guns off, for now. I want a weapon for each person coming with me, but I want them hidden in the Aerolaunches well enough they won't be found. I'll go in unarmed, but I'll be a damned fool if they think I won't have a weapon close-at-hand." I nodded.

Admiral Emerald: "You got it, K." She nodded.

With a bit of work, the machine guns were removed from their mounts and stowed aboard the larger airships. Weapons were concealed throughout the XY's, hidden carefully, but still fairly close at hand.

Going in unarmed.. how dumb do they think I am? And with no signal from Starlight? Or Dr. Gormutton? Yeah. Nothing doing.

The XY's would be within radio range of the Task Force, and Sombra had orders to come charging in with fire and brimstone if we called for it. The four Airships had enough firepower to do some serious damage, if need be, and the larger two had half a company of Aero Marines aboard, just in case.

Formal Uniforms for everyone. Gorcat looked good in an Equestrian uniform, actually. I kinda wished Gilda was here, but she wouldn't be cleared for duty for another week or so. Yes, her injuries had her sidelined for a month and a half, but she'd be okay.

The XY's flew straight to the border, and we radioed the Capital.

K: C> "Griffonstone Control, this is Alpha Actual - NEIGHTO Supreme Allied Commander and Party. Requesting clearance to enter your air space."

Griffonstone Command: C> "This is Griffonstone. Maintain direct course for the Capital."

K: "Alright." I shrugged. "Blizz?"

Blizz: "Heading and bearing set." She nodded.

We flew straight for it.. we watched carefully for anyone coming up the sides or rear. We noticed that, over time, a cluster of five Griffons armed with spears, did indeed end up following us at a good distance.

They were keeping us under watchful eye, and probably had a team ready to pounce us if we tried anything.

After all.. Griffons and other races had, at best, testy relations.

We progressed at a speed of 125kph. The total time would be about 40 minutes.

We could see the city as we approached. It was not at all what I expected - it looked like a giant tree, with hovels around it. The so-called palace at the top of the tree, looked like it had once been mighty, but was brought low.


TIME: 10:27 Griffon Kingdom Time (GKT/ERST)
DATE: War Day 885/9 Noneus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Griffonstone, Griffon Kingdom

We could see an area had been cleared near the palace, for us. A small plaza, with everything cleared out from it, and a very obvious pile of benches and what could only be described as artificial roost branches, stacked off to the side.

We landed right there.. and I could see that the larger plaza area at the front of the Palace had 52 Guards almost surrounding it. I counted. They were all armed with spears. There was a cluster of five of them, with someone in the middle in an old style suit with an ascot instead of a tie.

We let the ladders down from the XY's and climbed down. The Griffon in the suit approached us.

Prime Minister Buran: "Greetings, Guests. I'm Prime Minister Buran." He bowed slightly to us.

K: "Prime Minister." I nodded. "You wouldn't happen to be Gilda's father, would you?"

PM Buran: "..ye-yes! I-Is she here?!" His demeanor broke instantly.. the worried father came through.

Gorcat: "Sir." He bowed slightly to him. "I'm Captain Gorcat. I am the biological father of her Eggs, sir. She would be here, but she was gravely injured protecting her Chicks after Tirek's allies attacked and destroyed the Equestrian city of Cloudsdale with a magical tornado, a month and a half ago." He put an arm around Rainbow Dash and slid her forward. "This is Rainbow Dash, Element of Loyalty. She and Gilda are wed. Sir."

The Prime Minister took a bit to take this all in - I could see some questioning looks from the guards.

PM Buran: "..Miss Dash." He lowered his head to her.

Dash: "Ye-Uh.. Yes, Sir?" She was uneasy.

PM Buran: "I accept you as.. my Daughter-in-Law. My time away from Gilda has.. made me reflect that.. I should have been supportive of her all along. And.. you two have given me grandchicks." He put a clawed hand on her shoulder. "Instead of pushing her away, I should have opened my nest to you and her."

Dash: "Ah.." She got her 'confident stance' up. "She makes me the happiest mare in Equrestria! And you have eight grandchicks, sir. Fluffwing, Poppers, Litewing, Charger, Calaban, Chadler, Gorpuff, and Featherfall. Er.. they.. have my surname. Dash." She nodded, confidently.

Gorcat: "I do help care for them, sir." He nodded. "When the magical tornado hit, I tried to get to their house, but I was sucked out of the city and landed in a tree."

PM Buran: "I see." He smiled a bit. "Well.. the father in me, welcomes you to our lands." He stepped over to me and extended his claw.

We shook hands.

K: "Gilda has been absolutely essential in the war. She's been amazing, very brave, and very tough. She'll be back on duty in a week." I nodded to him. "I'm a father, too.. I know how I'd feel if one of my daughters.. felt they had to leave, then I heard they had a whole life without me, and were injured."

PM Buran: "I see." He smiled broadly, with pride. "Come! Come! We must see the Lords and Ladies."

His demeanor completely changed, he escorted us into the palace, dismissing the guards.

Without even trying, we managed to charm the Civilian-side of the Griffonic government. I hoped. I wasn't exactly sure how much power he really had as Prime Minister.

Entering he shabby palace.. I was struck by how emotionally cold it felt. Like, everyone here was going through the motions, but no one really cared.

Instead of a King, we were brought to a council chamber, where a number of Lords sat. There were also some other government officials, here.

K: "You didn't say anything about you guys not having a King, 'Cat." I mumured to him.

Gorcat: "Sorry.. I thought you knew." He murmured back.

Lord Gestal: "Ahh.. you must be General K." He nodded slowly to me.

Starlight: "K! Welcome." She trotted over, and gave me a hoof-hand-shake, pulling me close. "We need to talk, keep this short."

K: "I am indeed.. sir." I nodded to the one that addressed me.

Starlight: "This is Lord Gestal, head of the Council." She gestured to him.

K: "Lord Gestal." I nodded slightly to him. "My staff. Some of it."

Lord Gestal: "A pleasure." He nodded. "Ambassador Starlight has been explaining to me what you need."

K: "We ask only for peaceable transit through your nation, sir, so we can more easily get to where the Rainbow of Light might be." I bowed slightly.

Lord Gestal: "If you aren't sure about it's location, what reason have we to grant you passage?" He was direct.

K: "To make certain. Sir." I nodded to him. "The world needs the Rainbow of Light, to save us from Tirek."

Lord Goldstone: "To save.. YOU... you mean." He leaned in. "We.. are neutral."

K: "Neutral only until he invades, Your Lordship. And if that happens, we won't be alive to come to your aid." I looked right at him - this dude was a snake, for sure.

Lord Goldstone: "Tirek seems only focused on ponies." He snorted. "And you, Human. Bringer of Destruction or Salvation of Ponykind.. not us."

Gorcat: "..then you're a fool." He stepped forwards. "A fool and a coward!"

Lord Goldstone: "You dare speak!?" He crossed his right arm over his chest. "Outcast!"

Gorcat: "A redeemed Outcast, returning to the Nest in GLORY!" He puffed himself up. "Ask my father." He nodded to Gormutton.

Dr. Gormutton: "..it's true, I forgave him." He nodded to Gorcat. "He has risen to substantial rank within Equestria's military, and has performed numerous courageous deeds."

Lord Goldstone: "He is still an Outcast unless the entire flock accepts him." He nodded with a snort.

Gorcat: "Fine." He stepped forwards. "If that's what it would take to have my voice heard..." He nodded to the side a bit. "..I'll just have to go get the Idol of Boreas." And narrowed his eyes at the Lords and Ladies.

Lord Gemstrut: "YOU!?" He bellowed. "Not by my BEAK!" And pointed at him.

Gorcat: "If that's what it would take to make you FEATHERDUSTERS.. LISTEN to this HUMAN.." He gestured to me. "..then I'll do it."

Lady Gallifrey: "You don't have the stones." She sneered at him.

K: "Gor-" I was about to address him.

Gorcat: "I will. And I'll prove the Human's courage and pure heart. Him and I will go find it, together." He crossed his arms.

Applejack: "Oh, HECK, naw! Not without yer wife, yer not!" She muscled her way forwards.

Lord Goldstone: "FINE! It's decided!" He cackled. "Outcast, either you, the human, and his wife, find the Idol, or die trying!" He crossed his arms.

Gorcat: "FINE!" He snorted at them, and ushured us out of the chambers.

Once outside, the rapid-fire exchange between all of us.. we started to understand the gravity of the situation.

Gorcat: "..well, I'm completely boned. I'm sorry, K." He put a hand on my shoulder.

K: "Nonsense. We can do this." I nodded to him.

Dr. Gormutton: *Ahem* "General K. If my dear son DID bring back the Idol.. alive.. he would be able to forcibly reunite the disparate Griffonic bands into one cohesive peoples, again." He shrugged. "My son has quite simply declared he will return as our King, or not at all."

K: "..wut? WHAT!?" I looked between everyone. "Gorcat!"

Gorcat: "I knew what I was doing." He looked down, sheepishly. "I knew, going in to this, we'd probably have to recover the Idol in order to make them listen. Father thought they might see reason.." He shrugged, then looked up. "Remember, I owe you a life debt. If I became King of the Griffons and applied to join NEIGHTO? I could repay that debt. That's probably the only way, too."

K: "Gorcat.." I patted his shoulder right back. "..looks like we have a quest." I nodded to the others. "You'll return to the Enterprise.. and let everyone know what's going on. We'll get our field packs. And I'm going armed - I'm not doing a quest like this without a weapon." I shrugged. "Come on."

With that, we would make our preparations to engage in this quest to get the Idol, no matter where it might be.

King Gorcat?

Prince Consort Sunshine Smiles?

My friends were attaining high station.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Idol Questing

TIME: 12:21 Griffon Kingdom Time (GKT/ERST)
DATE: War Day 885/9 Noneus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Griffonstone, Griffon Kingdom

I was finishing loading up my Grant, and checking it over. Applejack was going through her pack, making sure she had everything. The three of us were in Equestrian Special Operations Chaparral Tiger Stripe. It was a greyish brown color, with streaks of brown, sage, and coyote tan.

The recently developed headsets for our short range radio units would see their first deployment, here. The headsets were a bit bulky, but they were resistant to cold, kept the ears warm, and helped reduce the sharp bark of gunfire getting to one's ears.

Gorcat: "You know, K.. this'll be my last mission with you." He nodded.

K: "I know, old friend." I smiled a bit.

Gorcat: "I wanted to thank you, for everything." He shrugged.

Applejack: "Aw, 'Cat, y'all're family, 'far's I'm concerned!" She beamed a grin.

One thing my trip to Colorado gave me was access to the stitch-and-loop design measurements for MOLLE webbing. As we were still mostly using the same canvas magazine pouches once used for Shermans, the new MOLLE-compatible pouches made a big difference. It was like going from World War I-era LBE's to mid-2000's LBE's. I made the loops a bit bigger, so they'd be more ergonomic to ponies.

K: "So, Gorcat.." Nodded around to the city. "..what can you tell me about Griffonstone?"

Gorcat: "..we used to be a proud kingdom. Then, a monstrous cyclops came after our golden Idol of Boreas. Our king died fighting it, and the Idol was lost." He shrugged. "The monster fell into the Abysmal Abyss."

K: "Hence why you said rock climbing gear." I nodded.

Gorcat: "Exactly."

Little did I know, none of the three of us should have been here for this, nor did I know that the proper event here would end in tragedy, with nothing actually resolved.

Surely, readers, by NOW, you know my people are capable of better than that.

We decided, first, to have a walk around the castle town - what little there was. I noted that there were very few commercial activites going on, here.

Gorcat: "Ever since the Idol was lost, the castle town kinda.. gave up." He shrugged his wings. "Everyone turned bitter and cold. Nowadays, wealth is the only thing that brings status. Now you know why outcasts that come back with fat stacks of treasure, looted from our various so-called enemies, end up being praised." He shook his head.

K: "That's what you and your dad were talking about." I nodded to him.

Gorcat: "Exactly." He sighed.

Applejack: "So, this here Abyss.. we talkin' a bottomless pit're somethin'?" She tilted her head.

Gorcat: "It's supposed to have a bottom.. a few thousand feet into the earth. I mean, from as high up as we are, it's probably not THAT deep from sea level, but.. the edge is up here, on the Grand Mount." He gestured to AJ.

Applejack: "Meanin' it were some kinda geologic process whut made it. Ah'm guessin' an extinct river 'n water fall." She looked at me. "That thar SmartyJack costume wasn't just fer looks, honeybun." And smiled.

Gorcat was hefting his Abrams.. same one he's used in all but one operation he's been on. Applejack had a Krueger DMR. While she wasn't as good of a shot as Rarity, she was better than most, and probably better than me, at least.

We walked through the town.. it was an interesting little town that showed it once had glory, but had been brought low by the loss of the Idol. Whatever power it had, it was very clearly gone, now.

Up above us, I heard a yelp.. and before I could react..

Gorcat: "I gotcha!" He slid about three feet, and caught a female Griffon before she hit the ground.

I walked towards him, grabbing his Abrams by the carry handle, and bringing it over to him.

Female Griffon: "Eh..! Th-Thanks, I guess." She seemed defensive.

Gorcat: "Name's Gorcat." He nodded. "Captain, Equestrian Army." He stood up with her, and set her on her feet. "And the future King." He said with a.. swarthy confidence.

Greta: "Greta. I suppose I could at least give that away for free." She dusted herself off. "Future king?! Hah!" She gently poked his chest. "I don't think YOU have the stones and straw to go fetch the Idol."

She.. was flirting. AJ and I both recognized it.

Gorcat: "I sure do." He puffed himself up. "I've survived dozens of battles as it is." He nodded to some of the other male griffons around. "I don't see any of them with a body count, unless they're beating up defenseless prey, or something." He turned back to her. "And I'm fighting Tirek." He smirked. "Saw him in person, too."

Greta: "..and you're still alive?!" She was honestly shocked.

Gorcat: "Yeah, but the coward threw a magic net on me, rather than face me, mano-e-mano." He crossed his arms, confidently. "There still Scones bakers around here?"

Greta: "A few.. why?" She cocked a brow.

Gorcat: "Thought I'd buy you one." He gave a tiny nod.

They're flirting HEAVILY. AJ was just smirking, letting her Krueger rest in front of her on her three-point sling, sorta leaning on it.

Greta: "BUY me one!?" She scoffed.

Gorcat: "Mhm. Captains in the Equestrian Army make 1200 bits a month." He nodded. "I'm not hurtin'." And smirked.

Greta: "Granny Gilstone still bakes." She nodded a bit. "You know the way?"

Gorcat: "Hasn't been THAT long since I've been Outcast." He shrugged.

K: "I noticed there's no central bakery store, or anything." I kept back a bit.

Gorcat: "Nah. Hasn't been one in years." He shrugged.

Applejack: "When'd the Idol git lost?" She asked.

Gorcat: "Mmm.. before my granddad's time." He shrugged a bit. "This was all I knew."

Greta: "..no kidding. And you really think you can get the Idol?" She cocked a brow, as we came over to a small house.

Gorcat: "I wouldn't've challenged Lord Goldstone otherwise." He smirked at her.

Greta: "You DID WHAT?!" She looked condfounded. "Okay.. with stones like that, maybe you CAN be king! If you LIVE long enough!" She shook her head in amazement.

Grandpa Gruff: "What'chu young folks wants!?" He spat out, leaning out the window.

Gorcat: "Grandpa Gruff. Same as ever." He smirked at him. "This is the Human of Legend, gramps. Show a little respect."

Grandpa Gruff: "Th-BY THE GRAND NEST!" He looked at me, stunned, and made his way out of the house. "No.. this.. cannot be!" He shook his head, and sat on his haunches.. pondering a moment. "Ten gold."

K: "Excuse me?" I tilted my head.

Gorcat: "You know that Chicago place you go on about? Think of it like that." He nodded to me.

I quickly grabbed ten coins - Equestrian 10-bits coins were gold - and handed them over.

K: "Speak your wisdom, old one. I've more cabbage where that's come from." I smirked.

Grandpa Gruff: "Mm." He held them up, and bit one, to test it. "Gold alright." And nodded. "The Human of Legend is said to be capable of actually destroying the Cyclops. That, of course, when the Cyclops fell into the Abyss, he was not killed, but sealed. Trapped. Moreover, the Human of Legend is to bear a great sword of light, and upon the tallest peak of Griffondom, gain the power of flight." He shrugged.

K: "I-What?!" I blinked.

Applejack: "Holy Celestia.. FLIGHT?" She blinked, too.

Grandpa Gruff: "I don't rightly know what it means, but one thing I -do- know? The Human of Legend will only defeat the Greatest Darkness through the greatest pains, and take upon them each a strength from every race. From the Ponies, you got magic - the sword itself. From us, I suppose, you get the power of flight. Should be more, but I don't know what they are." He shrugged. "And no, more money isn't going to help me remember."

Gorcat: "Huh! That'll be fun. Personal flight?" He grinned at me. "He's better than he looks." He said to Greta.

Greta: "Eh. He has a bit of a reputation." She looked me over. "Flying? Hah! You'll need lessons." She smirked.

Applejack: "We gots lots'a friends'll help with that, if'n it happens." She tugged me down to her level, so she could whisper into my ear. "If'n ya can? I wants me some cloud sex."

I turned a bit red, thinking about it.

K: "So.. uh.. Grandpa Gruff." I said, shaking my bits pouch. "Easiest way to the Abyss?"

Grandpa Gruff: "Three coins." He smirked, seeing I got the point right quick.

Gorcat: "And, Gran'ma? Four Scones, please." He leaned into the window, already putting some gold coins into her little pay urn.

So, it seemed, I was to gain powers, too? That the Sword of Rainbow's Light, all this time, was a recepticle for different aspects I could gain, different powers.. it made sense! As it relied on the Magic of Friendship to get the powers, and they'd be used against evil..

..I was eager to see what it'd actually mean!
