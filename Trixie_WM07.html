January 17, 1012 C.S.
08:37PM, Canterlot Royal Time
Grand Amphitheatre, Back Stage


Trixie and Coloratura stood in front of Sven Gallop. Coloratura grabbed Trixie's purse from where she'd left it just off stage, pulled out her pack of Camels, and her lighter, and stuck one in her lips, her eyes almost glazed over. She flicked the zippo open, lit the cigarette, and closed it. She passed them to Trixie.

Trixie didn't smoke too often, but often enough. She also took out a cigarette, and lit it.

The difference is, Coloratura smoked like a person that had broken, who's limits were shattered, and they had, at this point, stopped caring about anything to do with the person before them.

Trixie took her cigarette like a prisoner before execution.

Coloratura was relaxed, her mind having gone past "stress" and into "mental shut down" mode.

Trixie was tense as a long tailed cat, in a room full of rocking chairs.

Sven Gallop's face was red. Flushed. He inhaled and exhaled sharply through his nose. Like a Minotaur, ready to charge. Finally, he spoke.

Sven: "YOU... WILL NEVER.. WORK.. IN THIS TOWN.. AGAIN!" He screeched in a very high pitched, ear-piercing voice. "I WILL HAVE YOUR EEAG CARD FOR THIS!" He leaned into her, and stabbed his finger towards her, but never made phyiscal contact. He then turned to Coloratura. "AND YOU.. WHAT THE FLYING GREEK FUCK W-"

Coloratura: "Shut the FUCK UP, you little FUCKTARD!" She yelled at her top of her lungs, leaning towards him. "I FUCKING QUIT! I FUCKING QUIT EVERYTHING! FUCKING SUE ME, TAKE IT, BUT FUCK YOU TO TARTARUS YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT SLAVE DRIVING ABUSIVE FUCKING ASSHOLE! I'M FUCKING DONE WITH YOU! I'M FUCKING DONE WITH FAME! I'M FUCKING DONE BEING THE FUCKING STAR OF THE FUCKING SHOW! WHAT'S THE FUCKING POINT!? DIDN'T YOU LISTEN TO THE SONG? NOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooo! BECAUSE SVEN THE FUCKTARDED NEVER LISTENS TO ANYONE BUT SVEN THE FUCKTARDED!"

Sven: "HOW DARE YOU ADDRESS ME LIKE THAT, YOU SPOILED BRAT!" He screeched back.

Trixie: "FUCK YOU, ASSHOLE!" She stepped in front of Coloratura. "SHE TOLD ME EVERYTHING, YOU FUCKING PIG. YOU GOT WHAT'S COMING TO YOU! EAT YOUR FUCKING CROW PIE, AND GO THE FUCK AWAY, YOU GOT NO POWER OVER HER ANY MORE! CAUSE SHE STOPPED GIVING A FUCK!"

Sven: "AND HOW THE FUCK DARE YOU EVEN FUCKING SPEAK TO ME, YOU TWO-BIT STAGE WHORE!" He..

...backhanded her...

..just as Dusk was walking up.

Dusk: "..hey, asshole?" He tapped Sven on the shoulder.

Sven: "The fuck do you want, peasa-" He was cut off as he turned to see a Nightwatch Guard standing there, with his fist cocked back.

While Trixie reeled a bit from the backhand, the ABSOLUTE HAYMAKER that Dusk delivered, flattened Sven like deflated hot air balloon.

Dusk: "..you're under arrest for assualt." He shrugged. "Consider yourself subdued. You wanna resist arrest?" He grabbed his expandable baton, flicked it out of its holder, and flicked it open, then had it resting on his shoulder in one fluid twirling motion. "'Cuz I can make that resistance a lot of fun for ONE of us." He was totally deadpan in his delivery.

Sven: "..ugh.. fuck.." He was staring up at the ceiling. "..fucking.." He went to get up, but Dusk put his boot on Sven's chest. "..I give." He glared at Dusk, but all the fight was knocked out of him.

Dusk: "Miss Lulamoon? Care to press charges?" He looked at her.

Trixie: "I keep my EEAG card, or I press charges." She glared at Sven. "Your choice."

Sven: "Fine. Keep it." He snorted. "But don't expect to find any work. I'll have you blackballed everywhere I can."

Coloratura: "Don't expect that to reach too far after tonight." She spat towards his head, but intentionally missed. "Come on, we're outta here."

Starlight: "That was FUCKING AWESOME!" She clapped.

Trixie: "Yeah, I was pretty GREAT and POWERFUL, wasn't I?" She cocked a brow, and walked away with everyone, leaving Sven on the ground. "So, Dusk.. thanks for being my knight in shining armor. Twice." She smirked at him, and.. slapped his ass.

Dusk: "Eh." He shrugged. "I just don't like seeing people hit my fr-" He felt his ass slapped. "Now quit that." He gently scolded her. "Take your victory lap, but don't push it, yeah?"

Coloratura passed Trixie a knowing smirk.

Trixie: "..yeah.. sure.. not too far.." She had that old tone in her voice, again.. the crafty, scheming voice.


6:23AM
Dusk's Apartment

Dusk sat up in bed, and stretched. His hand reflexively went to his right side, and felt the body next to him.

Trixie: "..good morning, Tiger.." She purred.

Dusk FROZE.

FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-

Trixie: "..I remembered I wasn't the only Great and Powerful one around." She giggled. "Mmmm.." She reached up, and grabbed the stunned stallion around the neck. "..I'm not done."

She tugged.

He fell backwards.


9:22AM
Dusk's Apartment

Dusk: "..and if Rarity finds out, she'll be furious." He lamented over his cereal.

Trixie: "Mhm." She was smug. "I'm telling you right now, Dusk. I'm taking my chance." She leaned across the breakfast table. "I was a mess before. I was. We know it. Bad things happened to me. Lots of them." She shrugged. "A lot of it was my own doing." She looked towards the window. "I'm together, now. Mentally. Emotionally. I know what I want."

Dusk: "I'm ENGAGED!" He finally yelled with some emotion.

Trixie: "Yeah, so?" She tilted her head at him. "You were mine, first. I fucked it up because I didn't think I deserved a stallion as wonderful as you." She shrugged. "Last night? I finally discovered that I did." She grinned devilishly. "And I got reminded that I love having my hair pulled." She poked his arm.

Dusk: "Quit being silly about this!" He hissed. "I just cheated on Rarity! With you!" He sighed. "I.. I don't even know what's going to happen, now." He sank down to the table, resting his head on it.

Trixie: "Meh." She patted his head. "Enjoy what you had, and know, I'm coming for that ass." She gave him a sharp, but very lusty and affectionate, grin.

Dusk: "The sex was never the problem, sweetbuns.. ER! Trixie!" Yes, yes, don't get to calling her pet names again. Last night was nothing. A momentary lapse in judgment that Rarity doesn't need to know about.

Trixie: "Oh, I KNOW the sex was always the best." She smiled. "The way we know.. each other.. so intimately." She sighed a bit. "It's always the best." She shrugged. "But, now, I honestly, really think I have myself together enough to handle the rest. We've both been through a lot, Dusk. A lot a lot. Stuff that hasn't happened in 300 years." She said, in a normal tone. "You need someone that understands what you need, deep down, in your heart. Someone that knows how to make you feel better after things hurt. I.. we did that well, together." And shook her head. "And now? I don't need to be held together with dental floss and duct tape. I can be that for you, all the time." She nodded firmly.

Dusk: "..you KNOW that's not everything.." He sighed in defeat, though. "I mean.. you are right that.. we both.. need.. something. Emotionally." He nodded to her pill bottle. "Or we're both going to be on those. For a long time."

Trixie: "Mhm. You know I'm right." She shrugged. "Come ON Dusk, we were ALWAYS there for each other. Really." She nodded. "I.. didn't.. try recently, because.." She looked away a moment, then back. "I was trying to be respectful of Rarity's territory. But I just.. don't see her giving you what you need." She caressed the flesh at the base of his horn. "And I don't mean just the sex." She nodded.

Dusk: "...for now, don't tell her. For me. Please." He had his head still on the table.

Trixie: "Okay." She said softly. "I'll give you that." She shrugged a bit, as her phone buzzed. "..here comes he bad news." She frowned, and picked it up, quickly putting on her stage voice. "Great and Powerful Trixie, Mistress of Prestidigitation! How can I mystify you?" She paused, gave Dusk a look of 'Here we go' and rolled her eyes. She mouthed 'Disco Fever' to him. "Uh-huh.. mhm.." She nodded. "Breach of Contract, huh? Yeah. I figured you'd pull something like that. Listen, bub, your key act were terrorists. I'm sure the Nightwatch is going to be so far up your ass, you'll have to move crime scene tape to stuff food in your pie hole. So, I suggest you DON'T add 'not paying your talents' to the list. It'll be great fodder for a lawsuit, too. And even if I lose it? Your company'll be wrecked harder than a Pegasus with a broken wing." She paused as he rebuffed her, shrugged, slid sideways in the chair, and looked at her fingernails - SOME of the false ones were still attached, she'd need to get them off, she thought, as she listened. Then, she nodded, and shrugged. "Yeah, you can buy me off with 1800." She said finally. "I'll sign a contract saying I accept that as pay and absolve you of any - specifically - pay related disputes." She paused, and nodded. "Hell YES I want to leave open the possibility of suing for enadgerment and safety!" She snorted. "Uh-huh. Mhm. Alright, my original 2400? Yeah, okay, see how easy that was? I'll do it." She nodded, smiled, let him finish, and.. "Good bye." She then gave Dusk a look of 'please shoot me' and lowered her head.

Dusk: "And that was..?" He nodded to her.

Trixie: "Well, Disco let me know that his company and their corporate partners won't ever hire me for anything ever again. That's.. kinda.. huge." She frowned and lowered her head. "MegaSpark is kinda in a tri-opoly with Tunes And Notes, and Carstairs Corporation, to control about 85% of the performance entertainment industry in the country." She leaned back, looking down. "Fucking figures. I finally get what I always wanted, and now, I'll literally never work in this town again - not as a big name or leading name on any billboard." She scowled.

Dusk: "So.. what, then?" He shrugged, checking his watch, and gulping down the last of his food and coffee.

Trixie: "Heh. I'll be lucky to get kids parties. No talent agency is going to book me." She gave a wistful smirk. "Trixie Lulamoon: Weekend Magician." And shook her head. "Welp, looks like I'll be haunting the Classified Ads." She nodded. "At least the payout from this will get the car fixed."

Dusk: "That's good. I gotta get to work." He got up, and instinctively, as he passed her, without thinking, he kissed her cheek.

They'd done that so many times after a night of sex, that he just didn't think about it. He didn't even realize what he did even after he got his clean uniform on, and was partway out the door.

Trixie: "Have a good day at work, honey." She sipped the coffee.

Dusk: "..D'OH!" He realized what he'd done, the familiarity, and how it made him slip into the old habits, despite himself.

Trixie just smiled, smugly.

Dusk: "I'll be.. back.. after work." He cleared his throat, and left.


11:08AM


Trixie was laying on her back, staring at the ceiling. The TV was on, but she wasn't paying attention. Her phone buzzed, though, and she grabbed it.

{Text Message: Unknown Contact (11:09)} - Saw your act during practice. Got number from DF. Hear you need work. Call (122) 83-44971 ext 303.

Trixie: "Huh." She blinked. After a moment of thinking, she dialled the number.

Asst. Dir. Stable: P> "Canterlot Royal Memorial Hospital, Associate Director Stable speaking."

Trixie: P> "This is Trixie Lulamoon. I was.. given this number by someone saying if I need work, to call here." She blinked - a hospital?

Asst. Dir. Stable: P> "Oh! Oh, yes, I was.. someone told me they'd try to get someone to entertain. What do you do?"

Trixie: P> "Oh, ah.. I'm a magician." She shrugged.

Asst. Dir. Stable: P> "Sounds great. We'll pay you a set rate of 60 bits per day. You can set your hours, but we expect at least 4 per day. You'll have a floor nurse sign off on your times. Ahh.. this IS a hospital, so, we'd appreciate if you didn't use pyrotechnics. Personnel is on the 4th floor, go there to sign the contracts."

Trixie: P> "I'll TAKE it!" She smiled. "Shall I come in today, then?"

Asst. Dir. Stable: P> "If you wouldn't mind. We could do with some cheering up around here."

Trixie: P> "Let me get properly dressed, and I'll be right over. Thank you, sir. Good bye!"

Asst. Dir. Stable: P> "Excellent. Good bye, Miss Lulamoon."

Trixie: "YESSSSSSSSS!" She kicked her feetsies in the air, in excitement.

While she wasn't entirely sure why a bunch of doctors needed an on-call emotional support magician, she was excited at the prospect. Rich doctors being her bread and butter customers with some side work at the hospital? That'd be great.

So, Trixie went about getting ready...


1:27PM
Canterlot Royal Memorial Hospital


Personnel Assistant Paper Clip: "I'm glad the contracts were easy to get through, Miss Lulamoon." She nodded as she led her through the general ward.

Trixie: "I've signed those before. I knew what I was looking at. I'm kinda surprised you required an EEAG card, though." She shrugged. "Casual gigs like this, aren't due to pay EEAG commission fees."

Paper Clip: "It's.. not a casual gig.. Miss Lulamoon." She blinked, and led her to the Ward they were headed towards.

''PEDIATRIC LONG TERM CARE''

Trixie read it, and for a second, her mind didn't interpret what it meant. It didn't click over until the doors were opened to Patient Support Unit 2..

..and she saw them..

..very, very sick children. Several of them bald. Almost all of them hooked up to machines, but a few were not. Some very thin, some very pale.

Trixie had to whip herself back around the corner, before any of the kids saw her. Paper Clip looked over as the doors closed and moved over to her.

Paper Clip: "Are you okay, Miss Lulamoon?"

Trixie: "Th.." She choked up, instantly. "..they're not going to make it, are they?" The tears came almost immediately.

Paper Clip: "Ah.. w-well, I-I'm not a doctor.. Miss-"

Trixie: *Darkly* "Don't bullshit me, Miss Clip." She looked down at the floor. "Showbusiness is 90% bullshit, 10% performance. The truth."

Paper Clip: "I.." She sighed heavily. "..most likely, no." She said, very softly.

Trixie: "Then.." She wiped the tears away. "..they need the performance of their lives." She sniffled. "They might not have much more to live. Let them be happy." She nodded, solemnly.

Paper Clip: "I understand, if you want to back out.. we.. don't usually have many volunteers or entertainers that can-"

Trixie: "I'm not leaving." She said, determined.

Paper Clip: "That's.. very noble.." She didn't have the words.

Trixie, meanwhile, rummaged around in her case for a few things, loaded them into her sleeves and other parts of her costume, and hummed to herself.

Paper Clip: "Miss Lulamoon-"

Trixie: "Call me Trixie." She stood up, calmer. "This.. isn't the biggest stage in Canterlot.. it's just.. the most important." She dusted off her cape. "Prepare to see The Great and Powerful Trixie.. so powerful, even death itself will have no hold over these foals' hearts." She smiled, determined.

Paper Clip smiled.. her own eyes misted a little.

Paper Clip: "Then, I leave the foals in your hands, Trixie. And call me Pape, all my other friends do." She nodded to her.

Trixie: "You got it, Pape." She got her stride on, and FLOWED to the entrance of the ward - she used a simple sparkle-smoke illusion spell to make her grand entrance. "BEHOLD, Children!" She strode out from the smoke. "I am The GRRREAT! And POWERFUL! Trixie the Magician!" She took a bow, and as she did, flicked her right hand to make a bouquet of flowers appear. These, she handed to one of the foals. "Mistress of Prestidigitation!" She swept her other arm out, and from it, three helium balloons inflated quickly. "Here to entertain, amaze, and astound, such lovely foals as you." She said in a calmer, softer, kinder voice.


6:27PM
Dusk's Apartment


Trixie came in, stone faced. Dusk had gotten home an hour ago. He was lounging on the couch, deep in thought. Trixie coming in the way she did, made him sit up.

Dusk: "So.. Trixie.." He thought it was about what they'd done.

Trixie: "Remember our rule? No lies?" She sat next to him.

Dusk: "Yeah, about last night-"

Trixie: "I got a job today. At the hospital." She stared straight ahead.

Dusk: "..the hospital? Why would doctors need-" He blinked, and thought a moment. "..ohh.. Trixie.." He put his hands on her shoulders.

Trixie: "Her name's Brightflower Burst." She sniffled. "She wants to be.. a magician like me." She tilted her head. "Then there's Quartz Smoke. He wants to play soccer." She sniffled agian, trying to hold in the tears. "No one visits them, Dusk. No one." She slid against him, and held him. "Some of their families work two, three jobs to afford the care. Every now and then, one of them can stop in, if they have time." She let out a slow sigh.

Dusk: "Oh.. Trixie.." He lowered his head a bit, and side-embraced her. "..why?"

Trixie: "Maybe I identify with them?" She tilted her head. "Remember what my life was like. All I really had was you, and later, Rarity."

Dusk: "..yeah.." He looked grimly at the TV, but didn't pay attention to it. "So, uh.. how.. many kids are there?"

Trixie: "There's eight in the Ward I was in. Eight precious souls. There's another five in the Ward next to it." She looked over at him. "They call it Pediatric Long Term Care, Dusk." She just needed to be closer to him.. she slid into his lap, to make him spoon her, just for the comfort.

For his part, he did. He couldn't stand how she was feeling what she'd been through. Anything he could do to comfort her-

Rarity: "...and what the Tartarus is this..?" She strode in, seeing Dusk spooning Trixie, and both of them with very soft faces - to Rarity, this seemed a LOT LESS innocent than it was!

Trixie: "Rarity!" She stood bolt upright. "It's-"

Dusk: "It's not what it looks like, Rares. She had a really bad day-"

Rarity: *SNORT* "Well, don't stop on MY account! I'm JUST his FIANCEE.." She dripped this last word with venom. "..DARLING."

Dusk: "Rarity-"

Trixie: "Oh, don't EVEN take that attitude with me! You have NO idea-"

Dusk: "Trixie! Y-"

Rarity: "Oh, I do! I knew this would happen! I KNEW IT!" She hissed. "You haven't changed ONE BIT! It's STILL just ALL ABOUT TRIXIE, no one else! And you're just going to do it to him all over again, aren't you!? Sucker him in, SUCK HIM DRY, and leave!" She waved her hand wide. "Only this time, I'm not going to be there to pick up the pieces." She glared at Dusk. "We need to talk about this situation later." And back to Trixie. "You watch it. Homewrecker."

With that, she pivoted on her heel, exited, and shut the door roughly.

Dusk just stood there. His protests had been overriden by a chicken fight.

Trixie? Started bawling and ran into Dusk's bedroom, and shut the door.

Well, Dusk figured, this was about as bad as it could get. At least Rarity didn't know they'd bucked the night before.. but seeing them cuddled together? Yeah, Rarity had a problem with jumping to conclusions, and being greedy about her relationships with others. It could have only worked out worse if she'd caught them in bed together.

Dusk just plunked down on the couch, and was lost in thought again.. this time, about different matters.

He did, however, strike upon an idea that might resolve at least this part of things. He'd have to wait for Rarity to calm down, though. That'd take a day.

When that mare blew her stack, she really blew her stack, and it was just best to give her some space. That was one thing he.. to be honest, it kinda hurt that she had these times where she'd get so mad, he'd have to leave her alone for a while.

It made him think.. it made him wonder if this.. among a few other small issues.. was part of the reason he was kinda relieved that the wedding had been postponed?

Oh well. He'd call her tomorrow.

What bothered him more, though, was how easy it was to go into his own bedroom, and cuddle up to Trixie, to speak soft words into her ears, and massage her belly and chest, to reassure her. Not sexually, no, there was no lust here. It was just.. a very intimate physical comfort.


January 19th, 1012 C.S.
10:33AM
Dusk's Apartment

Dusk knew the situation was messed up. Having talked with Trixie, after what Rarity did, she agreed not to throw the sex in her face. Not that she wasn't tempted to - but the fact that she didn't, and the fact that she was willing to be quiet about it, meant and showed that Trixie HAD become more emotionally mature. Like it or not, this also made Dusk more... enticed by her.

Still, he had to smooth things over with Rarity. He still loved her. A lot. So, Dusk, now, was on the phone with Rarity. He had a late start shift, today, so..

Dusk: P> "You wanted to talk, we'll talk." He was calm, but not dismissive.

Rarity: P> "..yes, we do need to talk. Lunch?" She.. was slightly catty.

Dusk: P> "Alright, but I pick the place." His plan was working..

Rarity: P> "Done. 12:30?" She seemed accepting of this.

Dusk: P> "Perfect. I'll pick you up." Oh, yeah, and take you for a ride.

Rarity: P> "See you then, darling." Her tone wasn't its usual loving self, but it wasn't rude.

Dusk: P> "Good bye, hun." He hung up, and smiled.

When Rarity got convinced of her own jumped-to conclusions, the only way to correct her was to show her the error of her ways directly. Prove to her that she was completely wrong. Once done, she would apologise and everyone would move on. Dusk had been down this road before.

He didn't WANT to do it in this case, since it meant causing her some emotional harm, but it was better than letting it stand, or arguing with her. Dusk got ready, and called Headquarters, making sure he could get away around lunch time, to do this. Of course, he was fine.


12:28PM
Canterlot Royal Memorial Hospital

Out in front of the hospital was a large food cart court. You could eat anything you desired, here, from the local to the fanciful. It wasn't just popular with the hospital staff, it was popular with the community at large. This wasn't the first time Dusk had taken her on a date, here, since it was also about half way between Nightwatch HQ and her boutique.

Rarity was wearing something functionally fashiony today. It was cool, not too cold, but she had on her white fuzzy jacket, papakha (a tall, cylindrical faux fur hat with her Cutie Mark on it), dark blue pants, and shin-high faux fur trimmed boots. She looked classy, but underneath was a T-Shirt with a print on it, which she wore while working on designs and dresses.

Dusk... Class B working uniform. Close to a street cop's uniform, he had a beret, a dark purple jacket that went to his belt line, combat boots, and dark purple cargo pants that were made of heavy cotton - they looked very nice when pressed. He had a duty belt that went with it, too - sidearm in a +1 hoslter with 2 spare magazines, expandable baton, handcuffs, radio, contact tazer, and his combat knife horizontally across the back. It gave him options in the event something happened. He also, of course, had his bare hands. Elemental boxing and judo.

Rarity was.. calmed down, now. As a good night's sleep will do, and some time to reconsider her outburst. She wouldn't apologise right away over a slight like this, but she would be ready for reconciliation.

That was part and parcel of dealing with Rarity. She was a fierce hurricane, but at times, her wind and waves would be indiscriminate. She loved as fiercely as she hated, and if someone she cared about was endangered, lethal force was certainly on the table - life, social, or otherwise. Liek a true lady, she didn't need to put someone in a coffin, to kill them.

Likewise, Rarity, when slighted even by someone close, was quick to take offense and to anger. But, once she got some time to sit and think, she'd calm down. And after being shown the truth, would come around.

Dusk: "Hey, Rares." He hugged her, and she didn't resist.

Rarity: "I.. may have been.. a little.. extra, last night, darling." She frowned. "I realize I did forget that we've all been so close for so long."

Dusk shrugged, and smiled, holding up already-ordered favorites in a large sack.

Dusk: "Hence the date." He nodded. "Come on, we should feed Trixie, too." He said, hinting that they ALL needed to make up and apologize.

Rarity: "Oh, I suppose." She shrugged, but there was a tiny smile there.


12:37PM
Pediatric Long-Term Care Section, Canterlot Royal Memorial Hospital


Dusk led Rarity up here, while Rarity was nicking some Prench fries from the bag. She didn't realize where he was leading her, but she didn't care. In her mind, this would all be solved with Dusk reaffirming that she was his stallion, Trixie kowtowing to the reality that Dusk was off limits, and boundaries reaffirmed, with her in her rightful place.

Dusk had an idea of what Trixie had gone through, but he had zero idea what the reality was. He might later regret doing this, but at the same time, he knew this was the best way to restore balance.

Dusk, though, knocked on the door, seeing Trixie sitting with two of the foals, slightly opening the door.

Risen Dawn: "So, Miss Trixie! You think I can be half as good as you when I grow up?!" Her little eyes shone with sparkles of joy.

Trixie: "S-Sure thing, kid." She fought to contain her emotions. "W-We'll headline together, in Las Pegasus!" She pat her little head.

Risen Dawn: "YAY!" She giggled, playing with the little pinwheel Trixie had handed her.

Trixie caught sight of Dusk and Rarity at the door, and stood up, giving Risen and the foal next to her, Harken Field, little pats on the head.

Trixie: "The Great and Powerful Trixie will be right back, foals! Her friends are here, and so is her lunch. Yours should be here shortly." She took a small bow, to their cheers, and slid out, exit, stage left.

Out in the hall, Rarity had a bit of a surprised expression on her face.

Rarity: "That's.. very generous of you to offer to share the stage with her when she gro-"

Trixie: "-she's not GOING to grow up, Rarity." Trixie gave her a dour expression. "Three months, they say." She shrugged, her eyes dropping. "Her condition is terminal."

Rarity: "O-Ohh..." She blinked, and it started to hit her. "OH! Trixie-"

Trixie: "Save it, Rares." She shook her head. "You get it now? Why I needed.. him? Someone? Anyone? It hurts, Rarity. It hurts all the way down into the depths of my soul. I.. just couldn't handle it on my own. I need.. needed.. comfort." She took her share of the lunch, and sat down on one of the chairs near the door.

Rarity: "I.. think I do.." She sat next to her, as Dusk sat on the other side of her.

Trixie: "Rarity, I get it. I was in love with him, too. I know what that means. I know.. WHY you get so jealous. I know what he is, I know what he's worth.. I get it." She put her hand on Rarity's face, gently. "I understand why you're so protective over what you have with him, because if I was in your shoes, I'd be exactly the same way with him, over him, with other mares." She shook her head. "But, he's still something special to me, and he always will be. I can't just open up to anyone - but him? He's seen the worst parts of my life, and of me. He.. knows. You know?"

Rarity: "I suspect I do, darling." She said, softly. "Dusk really is something special." She smiled a bit. "Especially since he seems to know perfectly well how to gently show a lady the errors of her ways." She smiled, running her hand over Dusk's thigh. "You're such a lucky stallion, having two mares fret over you like this."

Dusk: "Oh, I know, I know." He smirked.

Trixie: "Yeah, well, I'M lucky I have two close friends that can understand me - even if one of them likes to jump to conclusions." She smirked at Rarity.

Rarity: "Well... I'm glad that I have you two to remind me when I run afoul of my good senses, darlings." She smiled a bit. "Trixie..." She lowered her head. "..these foals. Is there anything that I can do to help them? I'm not an entertainer like you, but.. if there's a way I can... give them a smile. One last smile, even.." She looked away a bit, trying not to think about the finality of it all.

Trixie: "Actually, I do. There's three teenaged girls in the next ward over that wo-" She blinked. "-they want to look pretty, Rarity. Just once. They want to feel pretty." She tilted Rarity's head towards her. "You know what that's like, right?" She smiled to her.

Rarity: "I-I.." She blinked. "..I do, darling." She got a little choked up. "I think I can do something." She smiled a bit back at her, and stood up, gathering her tools from her purse.. her dress measuring tools.

Dusk: "You.. keep all the tools for measuring and sketching dress designs.. in your purse?" He tilted his head in confusion.

Rarity & Trixie: "OF COURSE!"

They looked at each other and giggled.

Rarity: "I mean... one never knows. Fashion emergencies are just as important as anything else, darling!" She smiled.

Trixie: "Let me go introduce you to the girls, Rarity." Trixie said, rising from her seat. "There's a girl in there, Poppy Blossom, that's always wanted to design her own dresses."

Rarity: "Then, let us go, darling." She said, warmly. "I'm always keen to meet the competition."


January 25th, 1012 C.S.
5:37PM
Rarity's Boutique, Canterlot


Sassy Saddles, sitting in the manager's office, looked up as Rarity entered. She knew something was off about her boss - she wasn't just distracted, she was quiet. She also had a notebook in her hands.

Sassy: "Miss Rarity?" She half-stood from her chair. "I've got everything put up and the store ready to clo-"

Rarity walked over to Sassy's desk, and placed.. nay, threw.. the notebook down.

Rarity: "..she's gone, Sass." She said, distractedly, distantly.

Sassy: "Who? Who's gone?" She asked, confused.

Rarity: "The designer of our next line of semi-formal couture, darling. Her.." She choked up, tears coming from her eyes slowly. "..name, darling, was Poppy." She took off her glasses and wiped her face. "And her.. her designs.. we.. we will make them a reality." She leaned over and grabbed Sassy's hands. "It was her DREAM, darling."

Sassy: "I.. I don't understand." She shook her head.

Rarity: "You shall, darling. You shall." She put a hand to Sassy's cheek. "All nighter, get the coffee going, we've much to do."

Sassy: "If you say so, Miss Rarity." She bowed her head, and moved to get the coffee - the good stuff - ready in the break room.

Trixie followed her in with a large box.

Trixie: "Where.. what do you want me to do with the ball gown you made for her?" She tilted her head.

Rarity: "I shall contact her family, Trixie." She slid her hand over to the phone on the desk. "She may never have gotten to see it, but.. a lady such as her deserves to at least.. be pretty.. one last time."

Trixie set the box next to the design table, and slid up behind Rarity, hugging her tightly.

Trixie: "I warned you. There would be pain." She rest her head on Rarity's shoulder from behind.

Rarity: "You were right, darling. And it hurts. But, it hurts more that.. I could always have done something for them.. and I never did." She shook her head. "That changes. I'm starting a charity - to help those poor foals that will never grow up, so their families have time and money to spend with them, instead of having to work, or having to send them here, while they must live elsewhere." She slid around and embraced Trixie tightly. "I never did actually apologise for what happened last week. I'm sorry, Trixie. I understnad, now. Fully."

Trixie: "Friends?" She held Rarity close to her.

Rarity: "Always, darling. Always." She sniffled, smelling coffee start to brew.
