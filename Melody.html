   Let's just skip the formalities right now: You = Anon. Equestria = IDFK, it just happened. Time here = 18 months. Hope of Return = Celestia laughed about it, realized you were serious, and laughed harder. Who's fault is it? = No one really knows, and has ceased to care.

   Celestia gave you a house in Ponyville where Twi and the others can keep an eye on you. You've also got a small stipend to.. not starve on (she thought you'd be useless around there  and didn't want you to just die on her). So, you've become a Handyman-about-town to earn some extra bits. Never hurts. Besides, you apparently have expensive dietary tastes, being an omnivore. Only Griffons really eat much meat.

   One of your regular customers has become Octavia. The beautiful mare with the ear for music. She lives with another mare with an ear for.. different music.

   Dubstep. Wubs. Dear God, it burns.

   Your usual job is restringing her bow and cello. She does pop strings every now and then, and they're made of the finest materials.. Her own hair. Why do you think she takes such stellar care of it?

   Today, though, she's asked you around for tea and a few minor chores that are so much easier with hands. Plungers suck to use with hooves and mouths. Never mind a wrench in those tight spaces.

   Once you got to her house, you could hear the usual, wonderful melody.. her practicing her cello, and..

   "TAVI, DAMNIT! KEEP IT DOWN! I'M TRYING TO SLEEP!" Screamed Vinyl Scratch from her room.

   The only response is Ocavia increasing the volume. REVENGE! No, more like, she needs to practice and she doesn't like hearing the complaints.

   WHY do those two live together, again? You knock. Louder than usual, given the volume war. Great, now Vy is playing her Wub-Wub music to drown out Octavia. You.. just.. let yourself in. They'd never hear you knocking. Ooop! Almost forgot the earplugs.

   And there, in the center of the front room, illuminated by the light of the sun, is Octavia, playing with such passion as to take your breath away.. You shut the door behind you, and just lean against it, watching her play. Her eyes shut - her heart knows the tune to perfection - she plays with all her soul.

   It's a slower piece, with a long, careful middle.. soft in certain sections.. long and hard in others. It moves you.. the feeling of the vibrations from the cello.. you can't even hear the Wubs any more. Octavia finally notices you, once the piece is over..

   "Anon!" She gasped, setting down her bow. "I didn't hear you enter.." That British accent of hers. Light, airy..

   "It's alright. I'm surprised you could hear anything at all with that going on." You nod above your head.

   "It is a side effect of living with a musician from a completely different spectrum." She brushes it off. "Despite our differences, she IS my best friend." A small smile was passed  your way as she goes towards the kitchen. "Please, have a seat, I'll fetch us the tea.."

   Tea first? Interesting. Then, Vy came down the stairs. Her eyes were bloodshot again, she was dressed in a messed-up robe, and her hair was absolutely in ruins. There was a marshmallow pony that would freak if she saw this..

   "YO, Anon!" She belches out. "Ffffffffffuck, I need coffee.."

   She staggers towards the kitchen. Less refined than Octavia.. but she was nice to you, all the same. After a few sniping words in the kitchen, Octavia returns with a full English tea set, and sets it on the front room table. You suddenly feel rather under-dressed.. jeans and a t-shirt? Yeah. But, you finally have a seat.

   "I thank you, Anon, for coming over for tea.." She starts in, pouring your cup - in England, she'd be called Mother. It's.. part of the tea ceremony stuff. "Milk? Lemon? Honey?  Sugar?"

   "Uh, honey.. please. Just a bit." You shrug. You weren't a total mongrel, after all. You knew how to be formal and polite when the moment called for it.

   She added a bit to your cup and offered it to you.

   "Thanks. Uh.. why the tea, though?" There must be a reason.

   "Because, Anon.. I like to think of us as.. well, friends.." She shot a look to Vy, who was leaning in the kitchen doorway, scratching herself and drinking coffee from a levitated mug.  "..and I've already spoken to Vinyl about the matter.."

   Friends? Really? You thought she was just a really nice customer.. this wasn't the first time she made tea for you, after all.. but certainly the most formal. It didn't help that you had a  bit of a crush on her.. that you felt like her music brought back all kinds of wonderful memories of home.. that you truly enjoyed her company.

   What are you saying? She's a million times your better! She'd never..

   "What is it?" You sip the tea.. and it's wonderful.

   "I've.. had an offer." She set her own cup down. "But it is a huge change for my life." She nods a little. "The Royal Equestrian Orchestra has offered me a position. Third chair." She  looked at her teacup, thoughtfully. "But I would have to move and travel Equestria with them. I'd not be in Ponyville any longer."

   Vy piped up. "I told her to follow the music. I mean, it's not like she's got any special somepony here, tying her down. You only really get one shot at a chance like this!" Crude  though she may be, she was still good-hearted and thoughtful.

   Yeah.. no boyfriend. No family.

   She'd be going away..

   You'd never see her again.

   "So.. how long do you have?" You shrug, trying to keep the thought of her leaving from showing.

   "The opening is in a month, when their First Chair retires."

   You still had time..
   Time...


   Three days had passed since then. You told her to follow her heart, did your chores, got paid, and left. Since then, you've been thinking.
   Was it stupid that you were attracted to such a classy lady like her?

   It'd never work, you told yourself. Then again, you'd be even dumber not to try. A shot at Octavia? But what did that mean for HER? Part of you was satisfied with 'I just want her to be happy.'

   The other two thirds of you was calling you a little beta bitch for pussing out like this.

   Goddamnit, you were going to give this a shot!

   You scraped up the bits you had and went to Rarity.

   "..I need a formal outfit." You started.

   "Whatever for, Anon?" She asked, with pins in her teeth. It was ball season, she was busy.

   "You'd.. think its silly." You shrug.

   "Nonsense!" The pins were stuck in place. "Please, Anon, tell me."

   "I want to go to one of Octavia's shows.." You started. "..and maybe ask her out to dinner, afterwards?"

   She dropped the dress she was holding up, and zoomed over to you.

   "Are you serious!?"

   'She's way out of your league, hairless ape!' You expected to hear her say.

   "Yes. I.. I have feelings for her." You shrug.

   There was so much you weren't certain about - you liked her, you enjoyed her music and her company, and damnit, if there was any one of these technicolor four-legged sapient  creatures you could even begin to see yourself enjoying growing old with, it was her. So, it was hard to say, in proper words, what you felt.

   "Ohhh! Of course!" She seemed excited. "Now, come here.."

   You were telekinetically jerked over to a fitting stand while she took measurements.

   "You're not offended that a hairless ape has a crush on a pony?" You were a bit curious about that.

   "Spikey-wikey has all kinds of feelings for me.." She paused. "..so, I suppose I completely understand your predicament." She looked at you with a small grin. "The least you  deserve is a fair chance, dear Anon. And because I care - and I have a few things I need done with your help - I'll even give you a few pointers about how and where to treat a proper lady to dinner.."

   She was going to HELP you?! And, perhaps more surprisingly, she openly talked about Spike's feelings for her in a positive, non-joking light. Maybe she wasn't such a bitch, after all (she had that reputation around town, among a few).


   A couple days after that, you asked Vinyl if she had a show coming up. She did, and she got you a ticket. Octavia was always trying to get Vinyl to come to her shows, so she handed  her the ticket without argument.

   You were dressed up. Roseluck got you fresh flowers. Twilight used her influence to get you dinner reservations. The show was in Canterlot at the Bonare Theatre - one of those  places where up-and-coming orchestral groups often played. You were ready. If she accepted your dinner invitation, you were going to make this the best night of her life.

   Time to escape the Friend Zone, Anon, ol' chap - if you were ever really relegated to-
   You cut the inner monologue short. Confidence, damnit. Confidence.

   Train travel to Canterlot.. you took the train right after hers, so she wouldn't suspect a thing. Or see you.

   And you'd still get there before the orchestra starts tuning up..

   You arrive as the band is starting to get itself into their seats.

   "Octavia!" You announce yourself.

   "Oh! Anon.. I.. did not expect to see you here, tonight. I didn't think this was your kind of music."

   You walk over to her and bow your head a little. "Good luck, eh? Not that you need it - you're a fantastic musician." You give her a pat on the arm, and you slip a note into Octavia's music.

   "Dinner afterwards? ~Anon" She'd see it after she sat down and opened her music.

   You fuck off to the seat you were assigned just as she sits down. She opens her music, and the note is clearly visible. You get a small smile and a nod out of her - a very brief one, her director is watching.

   Dinner is ON.

   You can hardly contain your excitement. So, you sit there and let the music carry you away.

   The show lasts for over an hour.. beautiful music the whole time.

   Your eyes were locked on her, though.. the way she played.. with such passion and soul. Her eyes shut, her heart guiding her bow as it danced across the cello..

   As the last movement ended, the crowd erupted in applause and cheers. You threw the bouquet, and scored a hit on her lap just as she was about to stand and take her bows.

   She knows it's from you - they're her favorite flowers, and Vy isn't here. A bit later, you made your way backstage.. and there she was, cello in case and bouquet in her left foreleg.

   "Anon.. thank you." She bowed her head a little.

   "So.. dinner?" You ask, with a little shrug. "I got us reservations at Abonici's."

   "HOW?! That's.." She blinked. "..that's my favourite restaurant!" And fuckin' expensive. You owed Fancypants three days of labor for the dosh to make this happen.

   "Yeah, well, I had a little help." A smirk. "Come.. our reservations are at seven thirty." An this was times for a long walk along Canterlot's nicest streets.. by carriage.

   Which you escorted her out to. It was waiting for you two. And you'd open the gate door, and offer your hand to her hoof.

   "M'Lady.." A smile.

   "Uh.. thank you." She giggled a little, totally blown away by all of this.

   The carriage ride was slow.. but you spent the time looking at her.

   "Is.. there something on my face..?"

   "No." You shrug. 'CONFIDENCE!' Your brain screams at you. "But I can't help staring at your eyes." You shrug.

   "Oh." She blushed a wee bit.

   You get to dinner, and tell her to order whatever she pleases.

   "But.. it's so expensive..!" She protests.

   "I promised Fancypants I'd do three days labor for him. Don't worry, I've got this covered." You give her a shrug and a grin.

   "Why..?" She asked, finally. "Why all this?" She motioned around.

   'DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE BETA OUT NOW, DAMNIT!' More reminders from your brain, not to be a total wuss.

   "Because.. I like you, Octavia.. and since you've seem to got your heart set on joining the Royal Orchestra.. I didn't think I'd ever get another chance."

   "Chance at what?" She asks, with a slightly cocked brow.

   "To give you the perfect night out." You shrug a little. "If I didn't have to keep it a secret, I would've taken you to the opera instead."

   "OH!" She blushed, now. "I had no idea.."

   No idea that you cared about her? Or had feelings for her?

   Dinner went off without a hitch. You paid in full (it was as expensive as you thought it'd be, but the food really was good), and escorted her to..

   "The Alonzo Theatre..?" She asked, very curious. "They're playing The Tragedy of King Unimore.." She looked down, then up. "My favourite play."

   "Yeah. I would've started with this.. but.." You shrug with a grin. "..Vy's waiting over there, to take your cello home."

   "Anon.." She blushed again.

   You sat with her throughout the play. The reason she liked this one so much is, while it had very few musical movements, all of them made the cello the primary instrument to carry  the tune.

   The story.. isn't really important, but the TL;DR is, it's a love tragedy about a Unicorn king that falls for an Earth Pony back during the 'Age of Cold Feelings.' It ends with the king taking his own life, after she's killed by one of his rivals. Oh, he shanked the dude that did it, too, who happened to be his brother.

   Typical near-Shakespearian levels of intrigue and tragedy.

   You know, exactly the sort of thing cultured ladies would eat up like candy.

   She cried at the end - the actors were perfectly on their marks, all night. Escorting her out of the theatre, you guide her towards the park.

   "Now what, Anon?" *Lighthearted chuckle* "Dancing under the stars?"

   "Yes." You state, your heart immediately shooting into your throat. "The Royal Orchestra, actually, has a free show in the park this evening.. until just after midnight."

   You get there just as they start to play one of her favorite pieces. Out in a little section of grass, you bow and hold your hand out for her hoof.
   "May I have this dance..?"

   A broad grin on her face, and she accepts. You dance until the orchestra stops playing.

   You then walk with her to the train station.. last train to Ponyville was 12:30.

   On the train ride back, she rests her head against your shoulder.

   "Thank you, Anon.. I never thought I'd have such a wonderful evening with anyone.."

   "Me either, Octavia.. that was truly magical." You put your arm around her shoulder.

   "I never thought.. you of all people.." She blushed a bit and looked away.

   "Why not? We have culture like that on Earth.. I just never really had a chance - or anyone to go with - to experience it."

   You reflect on this.. the city you came from didn't really have much in the way of GOOD orchestral music, and Theatre was practically dead unless it was that new age crap about  Class Struggle and the oppression of minorities or women, people of different sexual orientations, and things like that.

   "I am glad.. that I had this chance.." She looked up at you under the moonlight. "This was really a special evening, Anon, thank you."

   "Well.." You start in. "..Vy told me that you've always wanted to get out to the mountains and have a chance to play your cello.. to hear it echo through the valleys and all that. Would  you consider having a picnic with me, tomorrow?" You tilt your head to her.

   "YES!" She gasps. "I-I mean.. yes, of course, sir." She nodded again.

   You got her home and bid her good night.

   No attempt at a kiss.

   Hey, you weren't certain if she was thinking 'He's just doing this to be a really special friend' or if she had a hint at your romantic intentions. Besides, the time wasn't right, yet, that was just the first date.

   "Oh, Anon.." She said just as she was about to go in.

   "Yes, Octavia?" You stop and turn to face her.

   She gave you a hug.

   "Thank you again, for a magical evening." And a warm smile.


   You were walking on air the whole way back to your tree stump of a home.


   Be Octavia

   Magical date with the hairless ape.. dear Celestia was it amazing.

   Totally out of the blue, too.

   You get home and hugged him. He was so amazing about this. Most stallions would have tried to kiss you.

   Actually, they had..

   Oh, well, you get in just as Vy is leaving.

   "Another set tonight?"

   "Yeah! It's gonna be killer.. I'll be gone until after dawn, sorry." She shrugged and got the last things she needed into her bags. "How was the romantic date?"

   "D-Date?" You were caught offguard by that accusation. "R-Romantic? Vy, whatever do you mean?!"

   "DUH! What, you thought he was doing this because he thought you were a good friend that needed a night out?" She made a 'snerf' noise with her snout. "He's totally crushin' on  you, Tavi!"

   "I-I had no idea.." Actually, after this evening, you sorta did..

   "Of course he likes you, yo!" She shook her head. "It's so obvious."

   "Really..?" You pause and lower your head a moment. "I.. never thought.."

   "That he'd totally dig you?" *Pssh!* "Anon's really into all that culture stuff. Why d'ya think he always drops everything whenever you need a hand?" She gave a dismissive hoof- wave. "You need to think, Tavi.."

   You supposed you did.

   Anon?

   A human?

   Liking a pony?

   Liking.. YOU?

   You supposed he was a very nice..

   ..what are you saying to yourself? He's always been kind, always been there for you.. and now, this date? Still.. he was a human.. and you were a pony.. would this even work?

   You undress, shower, and go to bed, your mind swirling with more questions than answers.



   Be Anon

   You're preparing everything for the date.

   Just the right foods, and a light pack. You toss in your multitool and a hand axe, just in case. Hey, you never know. This may be a safe-ish world, but there's always Murphy around. Besides, maybe she'll want to have a fire going, or something.

   Time for Date #2..


   You arrive at Tavi's house dressed for a hike in the woods and mountains. The trip alone would take a couple hours.
   A knock, and she answers.

   "Ready?" You ask, simply. "I'll carry your cello, if you want me to."

   "A-Ah.. Anon.." She looked like she'd been doing a lot of thinking. You know that look that girls get when they've been trying to work shit out? "..give me a moment." She ducked back inside and shut the door.

   You waited a few minutes, and out she came, dressed for a hike. Boots and a shirt, with her cello packed in its hardshell case.

   "Want me to carry it?" You offer.

   "Yes. Please." She offers it up to you, the handle in her mouth.

   You take it and strap it over your shoulder, then walk with her towards the edge of town. The whole time, she's silent, looking at the ground.
   Had she caught on to your intentions? Was she just doing this to be nice? 'CONFIDENCE!' Your brain screams. 'You are NOT going to wuss out like you did on Earth - you have a fresh start here, and a whole new set of chances. ACT LIKE IT.' So, you hum most of the way.

   Took a couple hours, but you finally got to the mountains. A nice little plateau off a hiking trail, the perfect place to set up. It's a cool day. There's still snow clinging to the mountain tops. You even set up her stand for her.

   "Here you go."

   "Thank you, Anon.." She moved over to her cello, and sat against the flat rock you'd put it by.

   Instantly, she seemed at ease.. and started playing. That smile.. that magical smile whenever she's deep into her music.. You listened for hours as she moved fluidly from one song to another. You couldn't help but sway your body in time with the music.

   Time for her present..

   ..and time to eat, you could hear your tummy rumble.

   "Octavia.." You get her attention.

   "Y-Yes, Anon?" She looked up, snapping out of her little trance.

   "This is a picnic.. time to eat." You shrug and pull out the picnic basket and goodies.

   And your cell phone.

   "What is that, Anon?" She asks, tilting her head at it.

   "A device from Earth." You had just enough battery power to pull this off.

   Suddenly, Beethoven's 5th Symphony erupts from the device.

   "Ohhh." She stares at it.

   "It's hard to explain, but this device used to let me communicate over long distances.. and it plays music." You had a 5GB chip in the sucker for a reason.

   "Amazing.." She stared at it. "..the music is so lovely."

   "Beethoven. He was a famous composer a couple hundred years before I was born." You say a bit softly as you pull out the food.

   Another surprise for her. The closest you can get to Earth food and still be palatable to ponies - a pizza. You had it in a warming case at the bottom of the basket, and roughly in the  middle of your backpack. It was vegetable topped, no meat.

   "And this..?" She looked at it - it was still warm - and sniffed it as you dished it out.

   "Pizza." A nod.

   "Your world really did have its wonders, Anon." She blushed a little and started eating.. you could tell she was mentally writing the music down in her head.

   "It sure did. I'm just glad I have a chance to share some of them with you." You shrug a little and distribute drinks. Her favorite fruit-vegetable juice blend - Cinnamon-Carrot-Apple.

   "With.. me.." She nodded, and ate. When the eating part was done, and the song over, she finally looked up at you. "Anon.. I want to talk." She said, firmly.

   "Oh..?" This could be good.. or bad.

   "You've shown me such.. kindness.." She didn't seem to know where to begin. Not do so and be 'formal Octavia.'

   "Just say what's on your mind, Octavia.." You nod to her and gesture a little. "..you don't have to keep your hair up all the time." Especially around you.

   "..I have a nasty habit of thinking I do." She admitted. "I should come right to the point.." She looked down and away. "..you're a human. I'm not. I'm flattered that you.. you have  feelings for me.. but.." She sighed. "I don't know. I just don't know."

   "What don't you know?" You didn't like the direction this was going.

   "Well, for one, I wasn't exactly in the market for a stallion.." She admitted with a small 'hah' in her voice. "..and for another, if I wanted a stallion, I would want one that I know will  treat me with the respect and care I deserve. Someone that appreciates me, appreciates what I do.. and at the same time.. is brave and intelligent.." She went on about these qualities as  though she sort of had an idea in her mind what they embodied.

   "Do I have competition, then?" You actively choose to take this in stride.. it's not easy. This was painful to hear. But it's not like you didn't expect it.

   "Not exactly.." She continued. "..I have an ideal, is all. A sort of.. Prince Charming that I've always wanted to have come rescue me. Sweep me off my hooves, as it were.." A smile.  "Not that last night and today haven't been absolutely magical.."

   "But you don't think you're ready for anything serious..?" A sip of the juice. Play it COOL, man.. play it cool..

   "I suppose that's part of it.." She pulled herself in a little. "Then there's the whole.. part.. of us being two completely different species." She rubbed the back of her neck with her  fetlock. "As unladylike as this may seem.. I.. do want a stallion in my life that can satisfy my.. needs." THAT left her blushing.

   "I don't think you'd find humans at all a disappointment in that department.. as ungentlemanly as that may seem." A shrug.

   "R-Really..?" She blushed harder. Then tried to get herself back on track.

   "A-As I was saying.." She cleared her throat. "It's not that I don't like you, Anon.. I do.. but.. I honestly don't know if anything between us would ever work out..?" She tilted her head  to the side. "I've been trying to think, all day, on how to explain this to you."

   "Oh, I understand. It's not like I didn't expect to hear this." You shrug a little.

   "So.. no hard feelings, then?" She perked up, trying to repress her emotions.

   "May I ask a favor?" Keep your foot in the door..

   "Oh-Oh.. of course." She nods a bit.

   "You've got a bit over two weeks left here, before you have to give your final answer. May I have your permission to court you?" You tilt your head a bit at her. "You've nothing to  lose, after all. If you honestly don't think we'll work out at all after that, then at least I had the chance to show you how I feel. And if you change your mind, you won't be left with the  regret of never taking the chance to try." Taking chances wasn't something you did a lot, on Earth. There was just no way to stand out.. now? There was.

   "I.." She blinked. "..accept."

   JACKPOT! Well, okay, not quite.. but this was better than a total rejection. You were going over in your mind exactly what you could do to try to win her fancy. You'd already used  up two big shots of A-Grade material.. what was left? You'd be thinking about this for a while, and in great detail.. it was time to ask your friends for help. You were going to show her exactly how you felt.. and how willing you were to do anything to be with her...

   ..at least, this way, if you lost, you had that Fair Chance that Rarity mentioned.

   Breezing over the next week and a half, the two of you made time in your schedules to meet each other every day.

   Lunch on one day, dinner the next..

   Dinner at her place, and at yours.

   You kept it cordial.. kind.. and romantic, without being soaked in apparent lust. The first weekend, you two saw a play. The second weekend, you took her to a circus (she'd never been to one). You talked and talked.. you played what music you could from your phone before it died.
   She copied the notes down, and stashed them way.

   There was a promise there, she'd give you credit for them. Her orchestra played one of the songs one evening, and got a standing ovation for it.

   You HAD impressed her.. and the Day approached.

   On that day, she asked to meet you by the train station..

   ..it was pretty clear that you'd failed to win her heart romantically, but by this point, but at the same time, you were now more comfortable with her as a very, very close friend.

   If she didn't make a last minute decision to stay with you.. well.. it'd be okay. She appreciated you now, in ways she didn't before, and vice-versa.

   "Anon.." She started as you stood on the platform.

   "Yeah, I get it." You shrugged. "You're still not convinced."

   She hugged you. Tightly.

   "Not for a lack of trying. You made this choice almost impossible for me." She looks up at you with a blushing smile.

   Yeah, that's a smile of a woman that really ISN'T fully convinced.

   "I understand. Music is your special talent. You want to be recognized for it. Your current opera group really only plays in a couple places." You shrug. "If I was as good as you are,  I'd want that, too."

   "Now it's my turn to ask a favor of you." She stepped back a little.

   "Anything."

   "I'll be taking third seat tonight, as you know. We're playing at the Royal Theatre in Canterlot. Tonight is Princess Cadence's wedding.. we're supposed to be a part of the festivities  beforehand. Would you come? And have dinner with me, afterwards?"

   "Of course. The least I can do is see your farewell performance." A warm smile.

   "That means more to me than you know, Anon.." She blushed and looked down at the ground.

   You could hear the train conductor call for All Aboard.

   "Better get going. I'll see you tonight." A nod.


   That night.
   If you had ANY IDEA what was going to happen, you would have smuggled an AK into Equestria. Or a belt-fed machine gun. Whatever. You got the formal wear on, and prepped yourself to perfection. If you were going to say good-bye to her, you wanted her to remember you looking your best.

   Not under her sink, dirty and with Vinyl's hair all over you, clearing a clog.

   So, you took the train..

   ..and watched her show..

   ..and went to dinner with her afterwards.

   Her treat, this time. She insisted.

   "You know, Anon, this wasn't easy for me to do.." She started, putting her salad fork down.

   "I know." You give her a bit of a grin. "At least I had a chance at it." And smile.

   "Thank you, though. At least, if anyone tries to court me in the future, they have a remarkable standard to live up to.." Yeah, you'd impressed the fuck out of her.

   Still, music was her life. You couldn't really stand in her way. This was her big break.. she'd have a shot at First Chair in a year or so.

   "I guess they do." A warm smile, and you toast her with the grape juice.. you didn't want alcohol in your system tonight. "At least I got to know you.. really know you."

   "That's not something just anypony... anyone.. can say." She blushed at that thought.

   Then, you heard screams. Terrible screams.

   "Wh-what's that!?" She stood up and looked out the plate glass window you were seated near - two rows from it, in fact.

   Something big and buggy suddenly slammed into the window, and shattered it. It was followed by two others..

   *HISSSS!*

   "Ah.. aw.. what the hell!?" Ew. Just ew. They drool, even.

   And they start grabbing up ponies.

   Snatching them right up and carrying them off.

   "FOOOD! FOOOD FOOOR THEEE QUEEEN!" They screech.

   One of them flies over to you..

   ..you have your fist back, ready to clock it..

   "Cannot.. feed.. on this.." It hisses, and looks at Octavia.

   "Fuck you, no!" You instinctively grab the steak knife on the table and plunge it into the side of the thing's head!

   C-Critical Hit..! It flops to the ground.

   "ANON!" She screams.

   You look up, and the other two have her. Everyone else is running for it. No time to think, you launch yourself over the table, and tackle one of them, crashing to the ground with it. It looks up at you with those bug-eyes.. tries to copy you.. and fails miserably, giving itself a headache in the process. You bash its head into the ground, and get up, blocking the open window..

   The last one fires a green beam towards you..

   ..perplexed for just a second, you haven't time to dodge.

   It hits you for absolutely no damage.

   Actually..

   "..that tickles! Quit it, you freak!" You slap your sides, and reach for one of the tables. "Come on, Bug Face! Let's go!" You hold it in front of you, like a bullfighter would with a cape..

   It charges you..

   "OH MY!" Octavia shrieks as it does..

   ..and you know it's going to try for the broken window, so, you drop the table and grab Octavia's hoof.

   A mighty Tug-of-War ensues!

   "Octavia! Bash him in the horn!"

   She smacks him, hard, twice in the face.

   It lets go, in surprise, just as the other one gets up.

   That gave you time to arm yourself with a large carving knife..

   "Octavia.. they're after you.." You start in.

   "As I noticed." She snorted, and grabbed a large, decorative platter in her hooves.

   "..we better get out of here."

   They charge the both of you. You stab the one you'd bashed into the ground. Not once, but three or four times. Octavia beans the third one upside the head with the platter. Then jams the platter on its horn, and proceeds to stomp it with her heels. They may as well be spikes.

   It's bleeding, squealing.. and then it was dead.

   You finished off the last one, that you'd been stabbing, by grabbing its horn (it vainly tries to magic blast you, and even copy you without success), breaking the horn off, and  stabbing it backwards into the hole.

   Yeah, ouch.

   "Come on, let's scram!" You grab her fetlock and made for the door.

   "You needn't tell me twice!" She yells.. but not in a panic.

   Admirable quality.. she keeps a level head. Out in the streets, you are both surrounded by chaos. Time to put all those hours playing Silent Hill to good use!

   "Come on.. we'll be safer if we can get somewhere away from the main.. horde or whatever."

   That meant going through the city..

   ..armed with a carving knife.

   Yeah, this is just like Silent Hill.

   Away you go, up the back alleys and over towards the south side of the city.

   "The south side..?" She queries.

   "It's the closest edge of the city.." And unlike Silent Hill, the two of you CAN escape. "..hopefully, Twilight and her friends are on top of this." They were the Mary Sues.. no, sorry,  the HEROINES of Equestria.

   But, you have to stop..

   ..as you both hear screaming coming from inside a building. Foals screaming.

   "Anon.." She began.

   "We can't leave them." You find a fallen guard, and take his spear, passing the knife to Octavia.

   "..so brave.." She muttered under her breath.

   "What's that?" You turned to her.

   "N-Nothing.." She coffed a bit. "Let's go."

   You charge into the building, spear in hand. To you, it's a pretty short spear. Easy to handle. Inside the building, though, you see five Changelings trying to grab up Foals. The little shits were squirmy as fuck, though, and the Changelings are stupid as fuck, leading to a comedic scene that would have you laughing if you weren't experiencing it firsthand.

   "HEY! BUG BREATH! HANDS OFF THE KIDS, YA PEDO!"

   "What's a pedo?" She cocked a brow.

   "Never mind."

   They turn to the two of you, hiss in anger/hunger, and charge straight at you. The first one was easy to get - you jabbed him (her? It? Whatever!) with the spear, right in the neck, and impaled it - its own forward velocity taking it all the way down your shaft (my,  wasn't that sexual?). You used the impaled bug as a bat to smack the second one away. Meanwhile, Octavia let the first one to get to her, grab her, so she could stab it in the eyes. The second one recoiled back at her display of hatred, and looked ready to puke..

   ..which gave you an idea.

   "TAVI! HATE IT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT!" You direct her.

   Taking your cue, she focuses all her hatred right at the bug.

   It vomits violently, and falls over.

   Octavia walks over and stabs it repeatedly until it was dead.

   "Damn, girl, you got a tough streak in 'ya!"

   "Y-Yes.. I don't often show it.." She blushed.

   The foals scurry over to the two of you and huddle around you, sobbing.

   "Relax, kids. I'm Anon.. you know me, I had to unclog the toilets at your school a week ago!" You pet one of them, comfortingly.

   "U-Uncle A-Anon..?" One of the foals chirps up. "A-Are you g-gonna protect us from th-the big bad.. bu-buggies?!"

   "Of course we are." You looked at Octavia.. she blushed hard and nodded to you. "We're a team."

   "Th-Thanks... Unca-Anon.." They practically cling to the two of you like glue.

   "Now what, Anon?" Octavia asks, glancing around, suddenly paranoid.

   "We get out of here. Come on.. I think I know a way."

   Experience from working in Canterlot - you learned all the quick ways around town to maximize your shekel-earnings for a day. Out of the building, the group of you makes your way towards the large park on the edge of town. You can hear fighting in the distance. Hopefully, the Elements can finish the job.

   But you weren't the kind of guy to wait around and cower, hoping for the best, while others did things for you.

   So, you led the way.

   More bugs on the road.. they were trying to get to some other ponies that had tried to seal themselves inside of a dumpster.

   "We should help them.." She started.

   There was a guard nearby, all tied up. And gagged. You idly wonder if there's bug cum in his anus, given what this feels like - a Hentai come to life.

   "Got an idea.." You look at the Foals. "Kids, hide in here." You usher them into one of those little holes that allow for basement windows in a building, and cover it up with a board.

   "Come back, Anon!" They call.

   "Shh.." Octavia gets all motherly on them. "..we'll be back, I promise."

   "Same." You nod. "Stay put, okay?" You pet a freckled one on the head.

   "Thankth, Uncle Anon.." Yeah, it's 'Twist. What's she doing here? Who cares.

   "What's your plan?" She asks as we get out of the alley.

   "Simple. That guard looks okay, but he needs backup. Us. Get to him, untie him, and we get those bugs together." You nod. "I'll distract them, you rescue the guard."

   "Okay... b-be careful." She makes a move, stops, and turns, planting a quick kiss on your lips. "For luck."

   Your heart practically explodes. That kiss was fantastic.

   But mind on other matters.. you march out into the street, spear in hand.

   "HEY! WING-FREAKS! OVER HERE!" You yell them.. and wave your arms around.

   Predictably, they turn in your direction. And decide to zoom over to you... just what you wanted. You knew they didn't want to take you, but they would take a second or two to  realize that. Enough time for Octavia to get over and get that guard untied.

   *HIIIISSSSSSSSSSSS!!* One of them sniffs and recoils from you. "DO NOT WAANT!"

   "Then have this!" You swing the spear like a stickball bat, and crack him in the dome~!

   He falls flat on his ass.

   The other three turn and look at you like you were the biggest threat in the world..

   "HEY!" You hear a deep male voice.. turn and see the guard up on his feet (with no signs of anal rape, thankfully) with Octavia at his side.

   He charged, she charged, and the bugs charged them, and you charged the bugs. This led to a frantic melee right in the middle of the street, with fist, hoof, and bug-hoof flying all over the place.

   All it needed was a dust cloud to make the scene complete!

   At the end of it all, the three of you stand over the crushed carapaces of these disgusting bugs.

   "Thank you for your help, Anon.." The guard nods to you, and goes over to the dumpster. "You can come out, now! The bugs are dead!"

   Who should pop his head out but Fancypants?

   "Th-Thank you!" He practically shrieks. He has two others with him.

   "Don't thank me - thank Anon. He did all this." The guard shrugged and helped them out.

   "I had help." You say, proudly, patting your bug-gut-smattered partner on the mane.

   "Yes." She smirked.. and put her foreleg around your waist.

   "A-Anon.. forget the debt! Please.. it's the least I can do.." You hadn't done your three days labor for him, yet.

   "No problem.." You look around and go back to the foals, getting them out of the window-hole. "Come on, you lot, it's safe, now." You help them out, one at a time.

   "Thankth, Unca'Anon!" Twist even gives you a hug. Octavia saw this. She smiled at you.

   "We.. what do we do?" Asked the Guard.

   "Get these ponies to safety. Come on - I know a way out of town." You say, moving over to a pony(man)hole over, and using the spear to pop it open.

   "Th-The sewers!?" Fancypants protests.

   "Would you rather get eaten?" You ask, tilting your head at him.

   "O-Of course not!" He whinnies in disappointment, though. His mane was going to be ruined!

   Down into the sewers you all go - Fancypants and the two others, the foals, the guard, Octavia, and you. The trail through the sewers was gross as fuck, but uneventful. You arrive at the edge of the city, and crawl out of the filthy tubes..

   "That was splendid, Anon.." The guard nods to you. "..I'll make sure Her Highness hears of this."

   "I had help, as I keep mentioning. It wasn't just me." I shrug.

   Right about then was the magical blast that signaled Chrysalis' end..

   ..you even saw her fly past you, cursing the whole way..

   ..and as you held your arm around Octavia, you looked into the rising sun.

   "A-Anon.." She started in, blushing deeply.

   "Yeah? What's up?" You tilt your head at her. Even filthy and covered in grime, she was still the most beautiful mare in the world to you. "You know.. even covered in grime like that,  you're STILL the most beautiful mare in the world, to me?"

   The Guard stepped away, and had to DRAG Fancypants to the side, out of earshot.

   "Oh, Anon.." She lowered her head, then looked up at you. "I-Ive made my decision.."

   "Oh?" You look down at her, smiling.

   "I can't leave. Not.. not after this." She looked up.. your eyes lock together.

   "But it's your big chance-" You start..

   "No. My big chance is with you. You showed me that, tonight. You really are a brave, charming, and committed knight in shining armor.. and I'd like to make you mine. All mine."  She leans up..

   ..you lean down..

   ..your lips get closer together..

   "JUTHT KITHH ALREADY!" Twist yells from the background.

   Octavia giggles, and pulls herself into your lips.

   It was the most beautiful kiss.. from the most beautiful mare.. ever.
