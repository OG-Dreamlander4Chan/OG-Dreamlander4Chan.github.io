	<TD width=1200><div style="width:1500px;overflow:auto"><pre>Empire of Roam (SPQR - Senatus Populus'Que Roamanus)

The Empire of Roam is an interesting case of Roman-Italian culture that never had a breaking point that caused the dissolution of the old order (Roman) for the new (Italian). Instead, a gradual evolution of the culture took place between 924 B.C. (Before Celestia) to the present day, slowly growing and changing along the same rough time frame from Rome in 0 B.C.E. to 2012 C.E. Even the language evolved, with Latin being called "Old Roaman" and Italian being "New Roaman."

Among the traditions retained by Roam include the Roaman Legions. While they were originally a tool of expansion and protection, the primary military force of the earleir Roaman Empire, they devolved over the years to a Royal Guard force, and, in a sense, the "Special Operations Forces" of Roam.

Like Prance, Germaneigh, and Ambleion, Roam once had overseas colonies in what are called "the Cervine lands," now, as well as the various Zebra lands and nations. It had the fewest of the European nations, but fought the hardest to retain them, finally being defeated at the Battle of Gallopoli in 917 C.S. and chased out of their last Colonial holding.

At one point, Roam controlled what is now the Principality of Vulpesylvania. Foxes there were not treated as second class citizens, but were instead, taken in as students to the Roamans and their culture. Unlike on Earth, where the Roman Gods were adaptations of Greek Gods, the Ancient Gods of Roam developed simultaniously as the Vulpesylvanian (Greek) Pantheon, and while smaller, were considered 1:1 translations for the purpose of worship, before the acceptance of Celestianism.

The departure of Roam from Vulpesylvania was a testy situation at best - the Foxes had grown somewhat reliant on Roaman trade and infrastructure, but over time, a definite preference for Roaman companies and products arose, as Roam began to institute protectionist internal trade. This came about largely because of internal corruption, and the rise of the Roaman Mafia. As they infiltrated governmental and bureaucratic office, they brought in policies intended to assure trade within the Roaman colonies and home lands, favored the products and companies run and influenced by the Mafia families.

Eventually, there was a civil "spat" between Vulpesylvania and Roam in 692 C.S., and both trade and diplomatic relations ceased by 699 C.S., as the Vulpesylvanians rejected the Mafia families' control over their internal affairs and commerce. This corruption also directly led to the military disaster at Gallopoli, as, by then, the vaunted Legions of Roam were now poorly geared, given substandard or rotten supplies, often had to pay "tribute" to a corrupt senior official just to recieve their essentials, often had their pay docked or "lost," and so on. The Legions of 917 C.S. were a FAR CRY from the Legions of 120 C.S., when Roam was at its territorial zenith.

Between 917 C.S. and present, the election of a line of Roaman Princeps Senatus from the Veloce family has seen a rebound in the nation's self respect. This started with the "taming" of the Mafia families, and the elimination of most of them, with a few of the bigger names still present in Sicily. The remaining Mafia families understand that their activities will be excused to an extent - but any interference or inconvenience they cause to the smooth governing of the State will be answered with violent repercussions.

Much like Rome on Earth, the Roaman state is dominated by the Senate of Roam, and the title of its ruler is "Prince of the Senate" in English (Equestrian). The Prince of the Senate is elected by the Senate itself to what should be, technically, a lifetime appointment, but they can be recalled with a Vote of No Confidence (Suffragium Nullitatis Fiduciae) that only requires a simple majority to initiate. This starts a Senate Election process where even the former Princeps Senatus may enter into the race to be elected.

Unusually, the Senate of Roam is unicameral. All Senators are elected by the Ponies of Roam by their governmental district (Regioni). This makes the Senate fairly large, but ensures that one path exists for any legislative action - from the People to the Senate to the Princeps. While there are a variety of other Royals in the nation, and some with direct control over various Regions, they, too, can be removed from office by the same process as the Princeps Senatus.

Senate Elections are every 4 years, and all elected officials are permitted to serve only 20 years total in any publicly electable office, save the office of Princeps Senatus. However, any Princeps Senatus that resigns, retires due to age or health, or is the loser of a Suffragium Nullitatis Fiduciae, may never again run for public office of any kind.
