Part 1: The Winged Hussars

TIME: 16:52 NRCT
DATE: War Day 585/14 Solarius, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Miaco, Empire of Neighpon

Emperor no Ken: "My poor capital.." He traced a hoof over a broken house.

K: "I'm deeply sorry, Emperor.." I bowed to him.

King Solarenski: "Emperor. If he had not done this, your land vould still be Tirek's. Zhis fight vas inevitable." He waved a hoof. "Much vorse than it should have been. Vhat happened?"

K: "We discovered Tirek's spy. The one that's been sending him all our plans - and the reason he knew what we were doing, here. And we killed her. We think she was Tirek's l-"

My head.. it was burning. I went to my knees.

Webley: "TIREK IS INVADING HIS MIND!" She screamed.

In my head, he spoke to me.

Tirek: "You.. filthy little monkey!!" He held up Cozy's body with one hand.

K: "You piece of shit." I spat at him. "I'm going to find the Rainbow. And when I do, I'm coming for you. I'm going to make you TASTE THE RAINBOW, YOU LITTLE BITCH!" I screamed in defiance. "EVERYTHING YOU EVER SENT US, WE'VE BEATEN! YOUR LITTLE WHORES ARE EITHER DEAD, OR RIDING MY COCK, YOU LITTLE CUCK! YOU CAN'T BEAT ME! I AM HUMAN, I AM SCIENCE, AND SCIENCE WILL FUCK YOU!!!" I made a very obscene gesture to indicate the 'riding' part.

Tirek: "YOU PATHETIC WORM! I'M GOING TO DISEMBOWEL YOU WHILE YOU WATCH YOUR FRIENDS DIE, YOUR CHILDREN DIE, YOUR KINGDOM DIE, I WILL BURN IT ALL IN THE HOTTEST FLAME YOU HAVE EVER SEEN! I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE ON YOU AND YOUR KIND, ON THEIR KIND, ON ALL OF YOU!! AND WHEN I CLAIM THE ULTIMATE POWER, THIS WORLD WILL BE MINE!!"

K: "FUCK YOU, YOU LIMP DICKED BULLSHIT!! YOU GOT BEAT BY HUMAN =CHILDREN= LAST TIME!! I'M AN ADULT, I'M NOT GOING TO =BANISH= YOU, I'M GOING TO -=KILL=- YOU, ONCE AND FOR ALL!! FOR MY FRIENDS, FOR MY FAMILY, FOR EVERYTHING I LOVE THAT YOU'VE TRIED --=AND FAILED=-- TO TAKE AWAY FROM ME!!"

He shattered the connection.. I had started to charge after him with the Sword of Rainbow's Light. And he shattered the connection, because, I was pretty sure, I could have seriously hurt him in this never-plane.

Waking up, I fell to the ground, at Roshi's hooves. He helped me up.

Bushin Roshi: "Ah, carefurl 'dere, young ferra. You try to fight Tirek in da mentarl prlane rike dat again, maybe you don't survive!" He chuckled a bit, and carried me back to where everyone was.

Emperor no Ken: "Generarl!" HE even helped me up.

Pretty soon, I was being forced to sit down on.. something. Everyone was around me. Applejack was under one arm.

Twilight: "K! You look TERRIBLE!" She lifted my head up. "He's pale as a ghost! CODY! WE NEED YOU OVER HERE!"

Even she was calling him by his first name.

Pretty soon, Doc Allcome was checking me over.

Dr. Allcome: "His blood pressure dropped dangerously low, his heart rate dropped.. no physical injuries, but I'd consider this a magical injury if I ever saw one." He shook his head.

K: "I'll.. I'll be okay." I said, just trying to come out of it, trying to wake up. "I saw him. I almost had him. But he shattered the connection he made between us." I pressed my fingers to my nose a moment.

Twilight: "I'm pretty sure the only way he could do that is if.." She suddenly started trying to get my shirt off.

Applejack: "TWAIALIGHT!" She hissed loudly. "NOT HERE!"

Twilight: "NO! No, I'm not trying to screw him! TRUST ME!" She pleadingly gestured to me.

Soon, I was being stripped to the waist.

Dr. Allcome: "DEAR CELESTIA! Look at the BRUISE!" He touched my back.

I screamed in pain, feeling as though my blood had turned into needles. Burning needles.

Webley: "There's something in him. Erm.." She picked up a piece of straw and very, VERY gently pressed it to my back. "Right there. It's the tip of Tirek's spear - I'm certain of it."

Cosmic: "I think she's right. I can feel dark energy from there."

Gaze: "Aye, shure enough, I can, too!" I could feel the warmth of his hoof hovering right over it. "I wager 'tis poisoning him.."

Dr. Allcome: "Wonderful. K----, hold very still, this is going to hurt, and I'm pretty sure drugs aren't going to dull the pain."

K: "Ghh.. do it." I rolled up my shirt, and jammed it in my mouth, biting down hard on the bundled duck cotton and leather.

What I felt next was akin to scraping every inch of one's flesh with sandpaper, then taking a swim in lemon juice, while having razor blades flay off your finger and toe nails. I was screaming, biting down so hard, I could feel my teeth. After a bit, though, it was over. I was seeing stars, planets, moons, everything. I could taste blood in my mouth, from grinding so hard.

Fluttershy: "I-I have cotton packing the wound.."

Twilight: "Look at the SIZE of it!"

Dash: *Snort* "K's bigger."

Rarity: "That may be so, darling, but the dark energy coming off of it is.. scary."

Dr. Allcome: "Let me get this in a container."

The clunk I heard was.. troubling. It was shown to me. Indeed, the tip of one barb of Tirek's spear, about the size of a half dollar, was in the jar.

I could only guess, at that point, that the surgery the Herdiets did on me, was incomplete. Likely because they had no way of knowing, or a process of detecting, evil magics. Probably due to their highly technologically advanced nature - they had less a connection to the magical and mystical. Sinichka had told us Pegasi and Unicorns were very rare.

Dr. Allcome: "This is how he made the connection.." He nodded.

King Solarenski: "By Celestia.." He suddenly laughed hard. "YOU are ONE TOUGH monkey, General!" An uproarious laugh. "We picked our allies well!"

Applejack: "Y'all pardon a simple country pony, yer highness, but mah husband's been through a lot werse'n this." She beamed with pride. "Had almost half'a his blood sucked raight outta his skin, then led a campaign a couple weeks later!"

Dr. Allcome: "Yes, then insisted I inject him with what, to us, would be a nearly leathal dose of amphetamines, so he could do it himself." He patted me on the shoulder.

King Solarenski: "Bahaha! Tough! We like dat." He grasped my right hand in his forehooves. "Do not doubt the committment of Poleland, Generals K." He nodded earnestly to me. "Ve side vith the brave, and against ze darkness. Ve are brothers, now! Poleland and Eqvestria! Together, to Tirek's DEATH!" He looked at his troops. "HOOOOOOORAAAAAAAAAAA!!"

*HOOOOOOOOOORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!*

Poleland was on our side, and their most elite formation, the Royal Hussars, were now blooded and veteraned. As was explained to me, they'd encountered small garrison forces numbering below company strength in their trek from the northern shore of Neighpon, to Miaco - the second shortest route, and one I'd discounted, as it was more mountainous and with two fewer mountain passes than the Osaka route.

They'd fought, and they'd suffered no deaths before the battle at Miaco. In that battle, only three died, and forty seven were injured. Compared to my Marines, who lost seven more dead, and a hundred injured. But, between us, we defeated roughly a Division of Tirek's troops that had been sent from the Western Mountain Defense Line to crush us.

Whomever had commanded here, had gambled that Forest Spirit and his force would be too exhausted to pursue rapidly, and wouldn't immediately detect the weakened section of defesnive line in time to come rescue me. They would have been right. But...

..then The Winged Hussars arrived. Coming down the mountains, they turned the tide. It wasn't Vienna, but they did save our hide. And, as usual, we were ordered to rest after this, by literally everyone.

Luna was also on her way with a few more ships, and several transports with supplies.

A costly victory for me. A devastating loss for Tirek. The time of our invasion into his lands grew nearer with each day.

Part 2: Stories

TIME: 09:10 NRCT
DATE: War Day 588/17 Solarius, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Miaco, Empire of Neighpon

I was waking up in the Emperor's Palace, in fine sheets of skilk, in a bed that was large enough for both me.. and Gilda.

Oh, yes, I did.

Hey, Dash is on the other side, okay?

K: "Wake up, Lioness." I kissed her beak.

It.. was a tender, but friendly kiss. What we'd done, we'd probably never do again.. but we'd both enjoyed it.

Gilda: "Mmmmm.." She lolled over, and pulled me into her, like a cat might. "You're better'n AJ boasted."

Dash, speaking of, got closer.

K: "Glad I could sate your curiosity." I cuddled Dash.

Gorcat: "C'n you two keep it down? I'm tryin'a sleep in."

A-HA-HA! DIDN'T EXPECT THAT, DID YOU!?

Gilda: "Mmm.. hush, Father of my Eggs." She gently kicked him.

He responded by throwing his larger arm over her, and patting my tender flesh.

Gorcat: "No matter what, K----. You showed me Hidora." He chuckled. "Now I'll never be even."

K: "Ah, hush. YOU just got to taste the rainbow, and soar with an eagle. I had to do that, AND pick apples."

Applejack: "Mmm.. too early." I got a pillow to the face.

Yes. Orgy. No, you get no details, you perverts.

Dash: "Hee.. he wasn't what I expected.." She giggled a bit. "..not doing that again, though."

K: "Cat penises have barbs. I warned you, Dashie." I smirked, cuddling her like a teddy bear.

Applejack: "Mmf." She rolled over, and stole Dash from me.

Dusty came in about at that point, with a rolling tray full of food.

Dusty: "K----? Breakfast."

Everyone stuck their heads up.

Dusty: "Well! Someone had fun last night!" She giggled madly, seeing the sight. "Two griffons, three ponies, and a human!"

Rarity: "Mm.." She slid out of bed, nude, and sauntered over. "You should have joined us." She poured coffee.

Luna: "Oh, really..?" She came into the room at that point. "Everyone out of bed!" She whipped the sheets away. "Except you, Applejack." An evil grin.

K: "Uh-huh. I need breakfast first, before you rape me." I sat up. Also naked. "No, really, that was the most fun I've ever had in a Victory Party." I hugged Gilda. "You're the tightest I've ever had."

Gilda: "Not any more." She giggled, sat up, and pulled Gorcat with her. "I want you to be my Wingman at the wedding, 'Cat. I mean it." She gave him a hug.

Gorcat: "No problem." He shrugged, looking at me. "As long as he's over on Dash's side."

Dash: "That's a given!" She hopped out of bed as well, and joined everyone at the breakfast cart.

Gee, ain't this torture? Everyone that tuned in wanting Clopfic, and all I'm telling you is what happened the morning after. Well, this isn't a Clopfic, even if I do get pussy and ass on the regular.

Anyhow, I had Luna draped over me in short order, a levitated cup of coffee in my hands.

Luna: "It's confirmed, My General, the entire nation of Neighpon is free of Tirek's hordes. Eight Divisions, you faced, between Osaka and Miaco." She murred in my ear - it was past her bedtime. "And you bested them."

K: "The Polelish coming in from the north was unexpected, but if they hadn't, we might've ended up fighting to the last pony." I shook my head, drinking the coffee greedily.

Rarity: "Indeed. King Vladislav's arrival was most timely. And I understand they did this without being asked." She sipped coffee as well. "They just decided to show up, and when they saw we were about to be destroyed, simply attacked with no preparation. Or, hesitation."

K: "They got away with it because Tirek's last offensive was done by troops just as exhausted as we were. Notice the last wave didn't have many Raptorians? I think they get eaten first as emergency rations by the Duregars and Goblins."

Dash: "Still. Those are some brave ponies." She scampered over to the pile of clothes on the floor, and got her uniform pants on, swaying her hips a bit. "Damn, K, you could've gone a little easy.." She gave me a playful look.

K: "The hell I would have." I smirked back. "I had to use all my Monkey Sex God Powers just to pull that off. If I'm going all out on an invasion, you bet your.." I twisted my smirk up. "..ASS.."

I got thumped with a levitatied pillow - Rarity.

K: "..I'm not taking it easy. Besides, your fiance didn't complain." Luna was getting her head under the sheets. "Ehm.. we'll.. have a meeting or something later.. everyone. Rest.. uhm.."

Rarity: "We should leave. Our dear General is about to be very busy with our Princess of the Moon and his wife." She shoo'd everyone out, dragging the cart with her.

I was tired, but Luna was.. horny. Like, really horny. AJ was just as worn out as I was, but the three of us did some pretty debauched things together.. albeit slowly. After about an hour, I was pinned between them, with them both asleep. Me? I was wide awake, suddenly. Bad case of Post-Nut Clarity.

I kept thinking about Tirek's threats..

K: "LAVAN!!!" I screamed, suddenly.

Luna: "H-what!?" She jolted awake.

Applejack: "Huh!?" She was awake, too.

K: "That's who he's trying to call on. He's trying to send Lavan after us." I squirmed out of bed and started getting dressed.

Luna: "Mm.. another emergency.. well, I trust you, My General." She gave me a confident smile and went back to sleep.

Applejack: "Mmh.." She shrugged, got out of bed, and dressed as well - her tan army cargo 'pants' and pony-style A-Frame (black, like mine) - and followed me.

I went straight for the Headquarters Area. Forest Spirit was there, as was Sacquet, a bandaged Brigadier Fosberry, and other senior officers.

K: "Spirit." I patted his shoulder.

Forest Spirit: "Blinda's out of the woods." He gave a half smile. "Did you really promote Ochre to Sergeant?"

K: "Yes, on my authority. He's earned it." I nodded. "That fight was as bad as Chowsin Ridge, or worse."

Teddy: "I wasn't there for that one, but if it was anything like that, I can't imagine how bad this war's been." He scrunched his nose up.

Forest Spirit: "I had two eyes when it started." He gave him a short look. "And over three thousand ponies were still alive - including Twilight's brother." He shook his head. "You've more than proven yourself, though, Teddy. Luna approved K's suggestion you be commissioned as a Captain."

Teddy: "Mm.. glad to hear I can hang with the big stallions. So, what's up, K?"

K: "Lavan, that's what's up. And we all know that doesn't call for a military solution - at least, it would be the worst option." I nodded slowly. "Tirek has threatened lava or fire on us twice - once at Mount Frost, and once when he drew me into that vision."

Twilight: "That's.. that's not good. Do you think we have enough magic to defeat him, in the tiaras alone?" She tilted her head.

K: "I think so.. BUT.." I looked right at Norfy. "We also have an expert in ice magic that's just grown stronger as the war's gone on."

Norfy: "Heh. You do me honor, K." He smirked.

Gaze: "Well, 'e's right, Norf." A nod.

Cosmic: "Where do you think Lavan will appear?" Always the practical one.

K: "I'm not totally certain. He might be awake, now, for all we know. What we NEED.. are geological charts and earth sciences information on where volcanoes are - active, dormant, and supposedly dead. He'll erupt at one of those, probably as close as he can get to Canterlot, and attempt a decapitation strike on our government." I nodded slowly.

Fosberry: "He could just as easily be seeking to decapitate any of our governments." She shrugged, nursing her bandaged left foreleg. "I suppose it depends on Tirek's mood, and Lavan's cooperativeness.." She looked at the other senior officers. "..if he wants a small victory, or a big one. Though, if I've analyzed Tirek's patterns well enough, he seems to prefer knock-out punches over small hits." She rubbed her chin.

Oberst Eisensattel: "Ja.. or.." He paced over to the map on the table. "..he goes for zee teknology." He tapped on Crystalpolis. "No Airships, und we fight as eekvals.." He raised his head, and nodded.

K: "Tirek.. doesn't HAVE aircraft.." I just realized this. "..okay, nearest volcano that we know of, to Crystalpolis."

Twilight: "Gloom Mountain." She frowned.

K: "Oh, of all the-" I growled. "-we need to get back home." I looked at the other commanders. "Look, ah.." I shrugged. "..get your wounded taken care of. Then round up your unwounded soldiers, get resupplied as best as you can - divert to Moligan Island if you have to for fuel - and prepare to depart. Leave a ship or two behind for any cases that can't be moved." I shrugged, looking to Roshi.

Bushin Roshi: "We wirr care for your wounded." He bowed slightly. "Is de reast we can do."

Pulkownik Pasterzki: "Tak, General." She nodded. "We haven't many vounded, if you need us, the King has said, ve are under your command."

K: "Humanitarian Relief. Split into smaller units with wagon trains, and get to all the towns and villages that have been ravaged by Tirek's goons and see they get food. Whatever we can spare." I shrugged. "Niihao Island has a lot of food, dragon-sized food, see if you can grab stuff from there."

Pasterzki: "Tak." She nodded slowly.

Forest Spirit: "And what of our forces?" He tilted his head.

K: "We just put our most experienced formation through a meat grinder. The 2nd Marine Battalion is combat ineffective. Reorganize their surviors into the 1st Battalion. That should give us just under a full battalion of Marines. Get them loaded up and prepared to move out for Cowrea. I'll send the 3rd and 4th Marine Battalions your way when I get back to Equestria." I looked at Blueblood. "How'd your troops fare?"

Blueblood: "25% casualties." He shrugged. "We can field two Regiments and a Company."

Then to Eisensattel.

Eisensattel: "30%. Two regiments remain."

Lastly, to Sacquet.

Sacquet: "15% casualties. We can field two regiments and two companies."

K: "Reorganize the spare companies into Raiders." I pointed to Sacquet and Blueblood. "Your fleets will prepare to move out for Cowrea as well." And over to the amorous admiral.

Tortellini: "The Legions fared well, however, the.. Ranger Legion.. as you call it.. took almost 100% casualties."

K: "Return one of your Transports with an escort and get another Camp of them, and another Camp besides." I looked at Forest Spirit. "We know they went after Cowrea - get there and establish a beachhead if you can. I'm going back to Equestria and see about the Lavan situation. If I take more than 30 days, do what you can to liberate Cowrea, set them up a modern military, and return to Equestria. If I finish what I'm doing with Lavan early or quickly, I'll come back you up."

Tortellini: "What'a our objective after we liberate Cowrea?"

K: "Simple. Take all the time we need to prepare each nation for the inevitable invasion of Tirek's home land. We work on our armaments projects, pick some fights with smaller garrisons, and clean up Tirek's smaller messes. We still have that Rainbow Factory to find, an armaments installation, and a rocket launch facility. Your soldiers and officers have had combat experience, now - they need to propegate that throughout your forces, and each military needs to finish building up mechanized and air forces, and anything else they might need. The campaign into Tirek's home land is going to be very long, and very hard. I have no illusions that from the point of invasion to the point of our final confrontation with him, it might be a year or more. We'll be cycling units and personnel in and out throughout that time. We have no idea how many divisions of troops Tirek has remaining to him that he can use to resist us, but I'd make a bare guess he can outnumber us ten to one. And while we're preparing, we have to harden ourselves against a possible conventional invasion. Backed against a wall, Tirek may think he has no other choice but to attempt it."

Fosberry: "So.. general idea.. how long until the war's over?"

K: "Two to three years." I shrugged. "And that's if killing Tirek, ends the war. There's always the Hero Trap of 'Kill the Big Baddie and a Bigger Baddie makes themself known right away.'"

Everyone seemed unnerved at that. I was being honest.

K: "Keeping in mind, about half to a third of that will be active combat in Tirek's lands, and possible smaller excursions. All of you have had a taste of senior command, now - I know you'll be able to handle whatever other little problems come up in your own lands, now, and how to lead your troops to victory. But, preparation is key. We need to have every tool at our disposal, that we can have, ready, before we attempt this.. or we'll get a lot of ponies needlessly killed. In my world, we called this situation 'For Want of a Nail.'"

Blueblood: "Care to share, K?"

K: "For want of a nail, a horse was not shod. For want of a horse, a knight had no mount. For want of a knight, the battle was lost. For want of a victory, the war was lost. For want of the war, the nation was lost. All for the want of a nail. Or.. something pretty close to that." I shrugged. "Basically, if we screw up and don't have our tactical and strategic toolbox as full as we can get it, we're going to get more badly hurt, or even defeated, if Tirek has things we can't imagine. I mean, look at that Superweapon he deployed here? What if he has a whole bunch of them? What if he can deploy three to each landing beach we each make? What is it going to take to destroy them? How many will die? We lost a lot of good ponies just taking one down, and it wasn't properly supported. Three, with proper support, could wipe out whole battalions, and with that caliber of gun, hazard most anything up to a battleship.." I looked at Kaltbluter. "With some exceptions."

They all murmured in agreement, and realization.

Tortellini: "And I suppose.. with'a these armored vehicles, we again have commonality of ammunitions?" A wise question.

K: "Yes, of course. Naval weapons are their own things, but on the ground, we need to have commonality of shells between armored vehicles, just as infantry does with rifle ammo. Each grade of vehicle will likely have different calibers - light tanks having 76mm guns, and heavies having 90 or 105mm guns - but everyone should have commonality somewhere. If a Germane heavy tank uses 90mm shells, and a Roaman tank destroyer uses 90mm as well, that's a commonality, even if the Roaman heavy tank uses 105mm or something. We need to avoid the logistical traps my own nation and others fell into when they fought that horrific world war I talked about. If each army can supply its allies with the same ammo, food, fuel, and so on, we needn't worry about individual supply lines, and we can work together much more easily. As friends, supporting each other." I nodded.

Eisensattel: "I sink ve understand, K." He nodded with a grin.

K: "Alright, I need to go prepare for my return trip. All of you, see to your ponies." I looked at Senshi. "I'll send some technical experts with the reinforcement fleet heading to Cowrea, so you can start industralizing and producing your own things. Given the destruction your nation suffered, I won't expect a high level of committment, but anything you can bring to the table when the time comes-"

Emperor no Ken: "Our nation izh as popurous as Equestria." He entered, speaking. "Our contrabootion wirr be equarl." He rested a foreleg on my shoulder. "For all of Equus."

K: "Thank you, Sire." I bowed my head a bit.

Well, after that strategy meeting, a general plan was set. This Conference of Generals set the course of the rest of the war.. I only hoped that, when the time came, we did indeed have the means to end it with our victory.

Part 3: Relegations

TIME: 11:33 NRCT
DATE: War Day 588/17 Solarius, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Miaco, Empire of Neighpon

The liberated Empire of Neighpon. I was finally getting a chance to stroll out in the streets. I could see Neighponese soldiers milling about - some had carts full of rubble, others were distributing food as best they could.

I still found it miraculous that Tirek decided to try the move he did, and emptied the entire nation of troops, just to try and kill me, the girls, and my best officers.

Applejack: "Sure wuz a nice lil' town, 'fore we blasted it." She snorted.

K: "Don't feel ashamed. We wrecked Ponyville pretty good, twice." I shrugged. "We do whatever we have to, to make sure there's a world left for them." I nodded to some fillies and colts that were running through the streets, giggling.

Applejack: "Still don't stop me feelin' guilty." She sighed. "They lost every'thin'.." She looked at some of the houses we'd blown over in the battle. "..some'a it's irreplaceable."

K: "War's like that. You lose things precious to you. Friends, posessions, prosperity, wealth.." I shook my head. "..it's not like we're going to get anything out of this war, from Tirek. Whatever peoples he's got under his control? They won't be able to repay us for the treasure we're spending. The ponies that died." I shrugged. "Best we can hope for, is, we save the world, liberate other species under his control, then open trade with them, if their lands aren't too devastated by the conflict, and they end up destitute. After that war I keep talking about, my nation was the only one almost totally untouched by it - it put us in a position to loan large sums of money and give away large amounts of goods to the nations that were devastated. Equestria isn't going to be in that position."

Applejack: "So.. what'll that mean?" She looked up at me.

K: "If we're lucky, everyone else will be in about the same state, and even though the national governments will have low cash reserves, we can set up a carefully managed financial system to ensure they can refill their coffers.. eh.. slowly, over a few generations. The increase in technology alone should open up new ventures and new commerce, new industry. Really, North Equus will be, probably by the time Pomme and them are Granny's age, back to where Coltonville was. The explosion in technology can go other places, too. Landing a pony on Luna, exploring the stars one day.." I slowly shrugged, again. "Who knows? Sky's the limit."

Applejack: "An' what'bout you? Us?" She nuzzled me.

K: "I hope I survive." I said, flatly. "Ever since before this war started, I felt like I wasn't supposed to be here. Not that I didn't belong, emotionally, familially, but.." I looked down. "..like I was brought here for a purpose, and I wasn't going to be allowed to enjoy the world I was going to help create." I looked at her, and ran my hand through her hair. "Don't tell anyone else I said that."

Applejack: "Hm. Yeah. Prolly best I don't." She sighed. "I hope yew do, too. An' if'n'ya do?"

K: "I will spend every second remaining in my life, enjoying being your husband, and father to our children. Grandkids, too, I hope." I leaned down and kissed her snout. "And if I turn out to be immortal, I'm going to build a gigantic statue to your awesomeness."

Applejack: "Awww! Honeybun!" She grinned widely. "This's why I fell in love wit'cha." And nuzzled my hand.

I didn't realize that Chemical Splash had been following behind us, until I glanced at Applejack's apple ass.. and saw her. With Wide Lens, no less.

K: "Yes, Captain?" I announced her.

Applejack firmed up a bit and blushed.

Chemical Splash: "General." She paced up. "I thought I'd give you some privacy."

K: "Lieutenant Wide Lens." I beckoned him over, gently.

Wide Lens: "Sir. Understand.." He looked bitter. "..my cousin bought it, here, sir."

K: "I was hoping to break the news to you first. More gently." I shrugged. "Sergeant Scatter Back took a lot of enemy troops with him, you know." I gestured, dismissively. "That doesn't help, I know it doesn't, but, I mean, what can I say? I got to know your brother a little, too." I lowered my head. "I'm sorry I haven't been able to save them."

Wide Lens: "..I don't blame you, sir. At least you made sure they died on their hooves, instead of being in Tirek's chains. I think we'd all be there, right now, if it wasn't for you." He sighed, though.

K: "You may not blame me, but I take each death personally. I always think, what could I have done better? Finding out there was a full on spy right in the middle-"

Wide Lens: "We hadn't heard THAT, sir."

K: "Yeah.. ah.. only a few of the survivors know about it. She was a pony, she was openly supporting Tirek, and she was the reason Major Gaze nearly died in Ponyville. Hell, she might be the reason Major Blinda nearly died here. She was informing intimate details about our battle plans." I gestured. "I'm certain killing her, led directly to the scale and depth of the battle we ended up with - Tirek was mad I murdered his girlfriend, and tried to kill me and my whole command for it."

Wide Lens: "Well. Good. Maybe Tirek can feel what it's like to lose something.. someone.. important to them." He shook his head.

K: "It's not wrong to feel that way, Lens, just don't let it consume you." I spread my arms in a wide shrug, and put a hand on his shoulder. "I'm going to tell you and Splash what I told the Generals in there. Three years is my longest guess.. without complications. I'm hoping faster, but.." I looked at Splash. "..I don't think it will be."

Wide Lens: "Then.. we're not even halfway there." He tilted his head.

Chemical Splash: "No, I'd say we are about at the halfway point. From the point where General K first appeared in Equus." She nodded at me. "That's what you're thinking, too, isn't it, sir?"

K: "You read me well, Captain. I like that." I smirked a bit.

Applejack: "Splains why he trusts ya so much." She smirked, too.

Chemical Splash: "Well.. we actually came for a social reason.. uhm.." She was looking down.

I looked at Applejack.

She looked back at me with an 'I have no idea' face.

K: "Lieutenant..?" Get the man to speak up.

Wide Lens: "I got my boss pregnant, sir." He coughed. "It.. we were three days out of Fillydelphia, and.. there was a full moon.." He turned even redder.

K: "Are you asking for my blessing as your father figure, asking me to be your best man as a friend, or asking for time off as your Commanding Officer?"

Wide Lens & Chemical Splash: "YES!"

K: "Okay. How soon do we want this?" I tilted my head.

Chemical Splash: "As soon as we can, sir. We overheard you're bound for Equestria as soon as possible." She nodded. "As for the reason we embarked on the supply vessels.." She suddenly looked ill.

Applejack stridled up, and pulled her away.. she understood only too well.

K: "Wide?" First name basis, now.

Wide Lens: "Well, sir-"

K: "Just K. If I'm going to be your best man or something-"

Wide Lens: "She actually wants you to give her away, sir. Uhm. K." He lowered his head.

K: "I'm.. so honored." I.. actually blushed a bit. "She really..?"

Wide Lens: "You opened her eyes, K. She said her real.. birth.. father.. went out to get milk one day and never returned. You've been there for her since she started.. you made her the first Gendarme." He chuckled a little. "I mean.. I still have the letter you wrote after Chowsin Ridge.." He looked away a bit. "A lot of ponies see you kinda like a parent.. like they do Celestia."

K: "I've been told that, before. I.. didn't think it meant this intimately." I shrugged wide.

Wide: "Well, in her case, it's the truth." He nodded. "Anyway, we were going to report that.. well.." He looked at the wrecked north wall of the palace. "..we had found further evidence of espionage. More Mimics. And evidence of another spy and kidnapping ring - we think it's the same one you and Colonel Sacquet encountered evidence of, right after your wedding."

Sacquet: "What is this, I hear?" He paced out, now sporting a very handsome scar along his right cheekbone.

K: "New scar. It suits you. Looks like a duelling scar - how's Julienne feel about it?" I smirked.

Sacquet: "She runs her hoof along it when we are intimate, mon ami." He smirked back. "Ze kidnapping ring, Lieutenant?"

Wide: "Yeah, uhm.." He shrugged. "..we're pretty sure it's a fairly large group, and moreover, that they're very organized. The kidnappings resumed not long after you departed for Neighpon. Ones and twos here and there - no military personnel, this time, though." He gestured with one hoof.

K: "Phillipe, I want you coming back with me, and your Legionnaires." I stared straight ahead. "If I get distracted with Lavan, I want you to bust this kidnapping ring." After all, I'm the leader, and not everything needs my personal attention. "You can trust the Fusiliers Marins officers, now, yes?"

Sacquet: "Oui, mon ami." He nodded.

Applejack returned, all giddy.

Applejack: "Mmm, gonna be a fayn' weddin' honeybun." She rested her head against me. "Got Rarity makin' some 'mergency dresses."

K: "Well, that's cool - oh, and that kidnapping ring is back at it. Sacquet's going to handle it when we get back. Wide? Make sure you go with him." I nodded. "They'll need a Gendarmes if they have to make an arrest."

Wide: "No problem, K, sir." He cleared his throat a bit.

K: "Splash tell you she wants me to give her away?" I looked at AJ.

Applejack: "Yeah! Y'all must be so proud." She smirked a bit.

K: "Eh." I shrugged. "I feel special."

A very young filly came very carefully toddling up to us at that point, and gently tugged on my pant sleeve.

K: "Yes, little one?"

Filly: "Shusseki shite mo idesu ka?"

K: "Oh.. uhm.." I looked around, and saw Sergeant Yanjiro, whom I waved over.

Applejack: "Aw, ain'cha jes' the cutest!" She lowered herself to the filly's eye level. "Ah'm Applejack."

Filly: "Anata wa watashinohaha desu ka?"

Sgt. Yanjiro: "Naze kanojo ni son'na shitsumon o suru nodesu ka, ojosan?"

Filly: "Ringo jakku!" She pointed to Applejack. "Koringo!" She pointed to herself.

Sergeant Mitsumi Yanjiro was one of Bushin Senshi's special operators, and had survived the palace battle. She was a cream mare with a striking black mane, and Campanula's build, on Applejack's frame. I guess she was quite attractive by pony standards, but...

Sgt. Yanjiro: "She say her name is Small Apple. And she knows the translation for Apple, in Equestrian."

K: "..she's an orphan, now, isn't she?" I cocked a brow.

Applejack: "..she t'ain't no orphan.." She just scooped her up and went inside with her.

K: "Ahhhh..." I shrugged, and shook my head in defeat.

Welp, there's another kid under my belt!

Sacquet and I were on the deck of HMS Moonlight, headed back to Equestria. We were.. having a bit of a heart-to-heart.

Sacquet: "Mon ami.. ah." He lowered his had. "I ask for advice. I do not know what to do." He shook his head. "I.. you know Julienne and I are intimate, yes?"

K: "Yeah." I was leaning on the railing, watching the ocean.

Sacquet: "I think.. I wonder.. if we should both survive this war." He sighed.

K: "Yeah, well, it's possible you both do. I hope you do. Heck, I hope *I* do." I shrugged. "I'd like to see your family's vineyards! I know Wine Grapes aren't much for eating, but I've eaten them before.. the taste is very distinct.. I'd like to try them."

Sacquet: "You and.. Miss Apple.. you were destined from the start, I think. Me? Julienne..?" He cleared his throat. "Do you think, mon ami, I should ask for her hoof?"

K: "I-" I turned to look at him, leaning on the rail. "What kind of a question is that, Phillipe?! I thought.. you know.. you'd already had!"

Sacquet: "Non." He lowered his head a bit. "She is.. above my social class. Technically, our.. intimacy.. is a slight scandal." He cleared his throat a bit. "But, none know, save you."

K: "Ohh.. right.. she's third born to Nobility!" I blinked. "What's her parents' title?"

Sacquet: "Eh.." He blushed! "..Duc de Lauzun."

K: "WHOA!" My eyes went wide. "Is La Selle her mother's maiden name?"

Sacquet: "Oui." He was.. VERY uncomfortable.

K: "So, her dad's the Duke of Lauzun.. that makes him.. what.. 7th in line for the Throne? And her.. what.. 14th?"

Sacquet: "10th." He nodded.

K: "Holy Hay Bales!" I laughed. "She never said!"

Sacquet: "Oui. It is why she wanted to serve, and not join the Clergy." He shrugged. "She does not, per se, want ze throne of Prance, but her older sister and older brother are not.." He looked down and away. "..when you spoke of Dandies being born into noble houses, I thought of them both. Her older brother is in the Palace Guard as a Captain.. which is well that he does not see combat. Her sister.. is.. unmarried and.. she does not behave like a Lady in private."

K: "She's a whore and a materialistic bitch." I nodded.

Sacquet: "I would not use those words." He frowned.

K: "It is what it is." I shrugged. "But, yes, Phillipe, I think you should ask for her hand. Maybe.. maybe the rules say it's not qute time, yet, but you TELL her your intentions to do so when the time IS right, you got me?" I pointed at him.

Sacquet: "Ahh.." He blushed and grinned. "..I hope she agrees."

K: "I think she will." I nodded to him. "You're brave, intelligent, caring, understanding, and.. so genuine a ponybeing." I shook my head. "And a fantastic friend." I leaned forwards a bit, and gave him a hug. "You deserve EVERY happiness, Phillipe." I patted him on the shoulder.

Sacquet: "..thank you, mon ami." He beamed a grin.

K: "Hey, any time." I nodded. "I mean it. You're one of my best friends. If I survive this war, and I get to stay here after it.. expect me to make it to Prance every few months. Just.. so we can talk and walk, and.. just be around each other." I looked back towards the superstructure. "And the ladies can enjoy each others' company."

Sacquet: "Nothing would make me more happy." He nodded, still smiling, and patted me on both shoulders.

Three days later, and I was at home. Nighmare Night was coming up, and Applejack was in something of a tizzy.

Applejack: "Ahh. Honeybun." She slipped up over me, on the couch.. the barn being halfway finished into a house of its own.

K: "What is it, hun?" I snuggled her into me. "You've been stressed out ever since we got back."

Applejack: "It's Luna.. and.. Starlight, too, ac'shully." She nuzzled my chest. "Luna's night's comin' up.. an'.. I kinda wanna do somethin' special for her."

K: "What do you mean?" I tilted my head.

Applejack: "Ah wanna go all out on th' costumes.. but.. more'n that.. ah wanna let her have YOU all night." She blushed.

K: "Jackie?" I blinked.

Applejack: "Starlight Mint's you's 'n her's.. this is her one night'a celebration. Ah'd be an awful Leading Mare if'n I excluded her or tried t'keep'ya to m'self." She almost buried her face in my chest, at this.

K: "Awww.." I hugged her tightly, and kissed her.. mm.. tasty lips. "..maybe you should've been the Element of Generosity with a kindness like that, honey."

Applejack: "Yeah.. heheh.." She was blushing! It was SO CUTE!

K: "I get it, though. Luna's.. basically.. #2 in the pecking order, and I get and MAKE time for her and Starlight Mint. I don't do that with any of the others.. that're.. in the Paddock, so to speak. Her? Yes. And you want to show her you recognize her status as sharing our lives with us." I stroked her mane.

Applejack: "Yeah." She pressed herself as close as she could, to me. "Yer mine. An' I know y'all'll never step out on me. No matter what." She nodded. "But.. y'know.. I know if'n yer immortal, Luna'll be yer Leadin' Mare.. eventually."

K: "Even in death, no one will replace you in my heart, Jackie." I kissed her snout. "No one."

Applejack: "Same here.." She leaned up and kissed my cheek. "..any'hoo! Costumes..!"

We discussed what we wanted to wear and other relatively meaningless things until dinner. And I reflected on how much I enjoyed doing just that.


TIME: 19:22 ERDT
DATE: War Day 605/1 Lunarus, 1003 C.S. - Nightmare Night
LOCATION: Canterlot

Koringo was dressed up as a little Japanese - er, Neighponese - female warrior shrine maiden. Pomme was dressed up as a Knight. Applebloom was a female Wizard. Starlight, not wanting to be left out, was dressed up literally as Derpy in Ranger garb.

I was in my formal uniform - saying to the world "I'm scary enough to keep monsters at bay - I need no costume." And with Luna (depowered) on my arm.

Applejack was.. well, I made her costume for her (Rarity did the work, my design). She was The Great Pumpkin Monster.

Luna: "We ar- I'm glad you made it back in time, My General." Every now and then...

Applejack: "Aww, we know what t'day means fer ya." She was on the other side of Luna. "If'n we're gonna share K in any way, means I gotta be here, an' I gotta be'a part'a this."

K: "Didn't think you'd be here, even four years ago, did you?" I shrugged.

Applejack: "Nawh. Thought I'd be stuck on th' farm most'a my life. Maybe find a husband an' settle down after a fair bit." She smirked. "Ah found somethin' fair sight better'n jes a husband."

K: "I'm in so much trouble, tonight." I sighed.

Sgt. Yanjiro: "You will be fine, General." She volunteered, nay begged her Emperor, to come back with us. And was dressed as a female ninja - the sword's real, too.

Luna: "Mm.. I'm glad to see so many children out and about, this year. With the war, and all, I was.." She shrugged. "..afraid I wouldn't hear much laughter or enjoyment."

Koringo: "Mama Runa." She was riding on Luna's back. "Koringo happy."

As it turned out, Koringo was about five. We did search for her parents, and couldn't find them, or corpses of them, so we presumed they'd been eaten. Which, as it turns out, was starting to happen with regularity. The people of Miaco weren't the only ones starving, Tirek's troops were running out of food, as well.

We learned that Tirek's troops had been told to obtain their food on-site, and none would be shipped. Various spots around the Islands were supplying them food, but we'd taken them over piece by piece - the loss of Niihao Island was the final nail in their supply chain. They'd already consumed all the food in the storehouses, and were starting to feed on the ponies.

We watched the festivities for a while, with Luna - actually depowered but dressed up like her nightmare self - making casual appearances. Myself? I was watching her.. mainly how she moved, and my brain relating that to how a human would move. My love and lust intermixing..

Also on my mind was how badly the ships were beaten up after the excursion. The fleet departing from Neighpon would be delayed two months for want of repair and refit - and that meant bringing machined parts from their nations of origin. The fleet that returned to Equestria was little better off. While we had engines that ran on steam, the metallurgy hadn't been as good as it should have been. Running the ships at high speed, and in combat, despite taking little to no damage, had the engines tired and worn out.

Hey, this was all experimenting. Now, we knew X and Y about A and B and could make adjustments. Things I didn't know automatically.

I ended up taking a seat after a couple hours, and watching the kids play around. Ironhide sidled up next to me.

Ironhide: "Sir." A nod.

K: "Ironhide." I nodded back.

Ironhide: "Cider, General?" Non-Alcoholic.

I accepted and took a drink. Cold, spicy, and tasty. Apple Family apples, I could tell. This tasted like Granny's cider, actually, but chilled instead of hot.

Ironhide: "Rumor's that the war's going to be another three years."

K: "Rumors are accurate. We just.. just now have armored vehicles, and we need to test them. Given how the gearing and engines fared after extended operations at steam in combat conditions, the armored vehicles might need their engines overhauled and replaced, if they turn out to have the same longevity issues." I shrugged. "After that, we need aircraft. Pegasi are okay for a lot of things, but they're very vulnerable."

Ironhide: "And you want to protect everyone you can." He nodded at me.

K: "Give them the best chance at survival." I crossed one arm. "You know me as well as most."

Ironhide: "I do. You're the one that suggested I take Shining Armor's place as commander of the guard, and Steelhoof's before that. You were there when they decided to resurrect Steelhoof.. you helped me guide him back to his eternal rest." He looked away a moment. "Not just as Guard Commander, but as a friend.. three years?"

K: "Given what damage we've done so far, the most we should see are minor engagements and skirmishes - Special Operations stuff, and probably more than one magic engagement that Science cannot fuck. I wager that Tirek is likely plotting a conventional invasion if-when his magical attempts fail. And they will." I nodded. "We have loose ends of our own to wrap up. Not just technological - we need the Rainbow of Light, and our leads have gone cold."

Ironhide: "And if we can't find it?"

K: "If we can't find it, and we build up what I.. judge carefully.. to be sufficient force to invade Tirek's homelands, go through practices, and iron out all the bugs, plus six months.. we go in anyway." I pointed to him with my mug-filled hand. "Only if I have at least three Atomic Bombs and the means to deliver them, as an alternative."

Ironhide: "I see." He nodded. "Tirek is truly frightening. You are more than correct, I wager, in wanting those horrible weapons as an alternative to the Rainbow."

K: "That's the thing, Ironhide. I DON'T want them. They're horrible, terrible, frightening weapons.. but they bring their own kind of balance. No major war has been fought between nuclear-armed nations, for fear of what these weapons can do. This is both good and bad." I shrugged. "The fear of war has lessened, in my world, leading to a very laxadasial existence.. decadence, almost.. but, things here work differently. I don't think ponies will have those issues."

Ironhide: "Heh.. I see." He grinned a little. "I am glad that, if we are to have this war, we are led by someone that does not want it, and seeks to end it as fast as possible, as well as possible."

K: "Yeap.. that's me." I shrugged. "At least the whole 'everything with a pulse wants Monkey God Dick' has calmed down."

Ironhide: *Guffaw* "We Guards had betting pools going on how long certain females would take to fall to your charms, General."

K: "Uh-huh. Who won most of them?" I looked at him.

Ironhide: "I won twice. Katrina and Twilight." He smirked.

K: "I didn't realize what we'd done in the Crystal Kingdom was public knowledge."

Ironhide: "Soldiers talk, General. You know that." He nodded a bit. "We just have the decency to not bring it up."

Speaking of which, Spike and Twilight came pacing up. Spike was dressed like a soldier. Twilight was dressed as a.. rather sexy witch, actually, but without being slutty.

K: "Nice, Twilight." I smirked. "Spike, looking good."

Twilight: "Glad you're having a good time, K." She grinned a little, looking at everything going on. "It's so nice, tonight. A bit colder than usual.."

K: "Going to be a pretty cold winter. We'll need cold weather gear for the Gloom Mountain Operation - make sure we have it. Three days." I nodded.

Twilight: "I'll pass the message along to Rarity." She shrugged. "I would not be surprised if she had something special in store."

Spike: "Should we really go in the winter, K?" He tilted his head a bit.

K: "We go now, or we risk Lavan wrecking everything and killing a lot of ponies." I shrugged. "As it is, I have a Paratrooper and Aero Marine unit in the area performing security."

Twilight: "I'm actually glad for that. At least we have eyes on." She sighed. "That's tomorrow Twilight's worries, though. Come on, Spike." She led him away.

I pushed off the stump I'd been leaning against, and paced into the crowd. I reflected on how all the girls were kinda spoiled to paranoia and tactical thinking, now. I even saw Pinkie and Toola together, having fun, both dressed as clowns - I noted, however, that Pinkie was in a palette swap bodysuit that looked a lot like Harley Quinn's original animated series outfit. Her colors, however, were pink and blue, not red and black, and the diamonds were yellow. Toola was a more traditional clown, with a conical hat. I knew Pinkie - she did that outfit for me.

I walked and stared at everything going on around me. This was Luna's night, and as much as I wanted to be there to support her, I didn't want people to still equate me with her - that she was somehow propped up by me, that she was her own Mare.

Eventually, I got to the edge of the city. The guards, here, were alert and watching. A patrol of Gendarmes passed me, giving casual salutes, but armed up. No one was sneaking into town, tonight.

House Guard Silk Moon: "General K." She nodded to me, saluting with her rifle. "All quiet here, sir."

K: "Guardspony." I nodded back to her, standing at the tortum of the East Gate. The gate was open, and I could look out into the forest between Canterlot and the mountains to the east. The moon framed the picture perfectly. "Perfect night for this." I nodded.

Silk Moon: "Yes, sir." She nodded, staring almost straight ahead.

K: "Relax, Guardspony. This isn't an inspection." I shrugged a bit. "You're new, yes?"

Silk Moon: "Aye, sir. 2nd Company, 1st Platoon, 3rd Squad." That would be Luna's Night Watch. 1st Company was Celelstia. "This is my fifth night guarding."

K: "Mmm..!" I nodded. "We're glad to have you." I gave her a confident grin.

I then realized she was.. a bit older than the girls. Mid-30's. A career change? It also struck me that I was able to roughly age-guess ponies at just a look. Three years of immersion will do that, I suppose.

K: "What'd you do before this?" I asked, casually.

Silk Moon: "Ohh.. I was.. I worked at a daycare, and then at BonLoaves Breadery." It was an industrial-scale bread and bun maker. "I got tired of office work.." She trailed off a bit. "..I've always felt more at home in the darkness."

K: "Interesting. What's your Special Talent?" I asked - as this was technically polite conversation.

Silk Moon: "Well.. I can see in the darkness very well.. I'm also incredibly orderly, punctual and neat. My talent revolves around.. maintaining order, really. After I started the training, I realized I should have been a guard all my life." She giggled a bit.

K: "Married? Kids?" I asked, looking back at the moon.

Silk Moon: "Not presently. I was dating someone at the Breadery, but.. when I became a Guard, that fell through." She sighed a bit.

K: "Oh, you'll find happiness. Now that you're where you're supposed to be, everything will work out." I could feel a tinge of self-doubt from her - ponies are, after all, very expressive.

Silk Moon: "Y-Yes, sir." She sounded a bit surprised that I'd be so forward about it.

I could hear something.. in the distance. It sounded like.. I wasn't sure.

K: "..did you hear that?" I asked, looking towards the source of the sound.

Silk Moon: "Aye, sir!" She moved out with me, and stared.. squinted.. into the dark forest. "I see something, too.." She reared back just slightly. "I'm not sure what it is."

K: "Call your squadmate." I cocked a brow, and pulled my Morgan.

Silk Moon: "Misty!" She hissed into the Tortum Guard House.

Senior Guard Misty Stars: "What is it, Silk?" She stepped out, rifle shouldered.

Both of them were a shade of grey. Misty was a.. mistier shade, lighter, but with clear shades on her edges that were a darkish purple. Silk is a darker base grey, and has some reddish in her, mainly her mane.

K: "Both of you come with me. Call in that Gendarmes patrol, have them secure the Tortum." I motioned casually.

Misty: "Roger, General." She hefted her radio. C> "Post 3 Echo to Golf 11, cover Post 3 Echo. Over."

Gendarmes: C> "11 Golf, Roger. ETA three minutes."

K: "Come on." I started walking towards the sound.

Smartly, Misty ducked back in to the Tortum Guard House and grabbed a Chaffee, which she nodded to me, and-

Misty: "Ca'ch!" Hefted in my direction.

I caught it onehanded and cradled it to me. The sling had a small quiver attached for two extra tubes. Been a bit since I'd used one, so I took a second to remind myself of the controls, holstering my Morgan.

K: "Good thinking." I nodded.

What was out there? I'd find out, and I wasn't going to like the answer.

DATE: War Day 627/32 Lunarus 1003 C.S. - Nightmare Night
LOCATION: Canterlot East Woods

The three of us were stalking the edge of the main path through the woods. Myself, Silk Moon, and Misty Stars. I'd never worked with them, before - hell, I'd never met them before. But, they were trained, they should know what they're doing.

Silk was in front, as she could see what was going on ahead. I was tail-end charlie, as I had a Chaffee shotgun. I was also in my formal Winter/Fall uniform, the blue-buff-white ordeal I'd worn aboard the Ceasar. I zipped the jacket closed, to conceal the white part as best as possible.

Silk Moon: "The trees!" She pointed.

I couldn't see what she was pointing at. I could see stars through the tree branches..

..wait, that wasn't right..

..the forest canopy should be blocking out-

K: "FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!"

I raised the Chaffee and started shooting into the trees, blast after blast of shotgun shells, loud and booming. They opened fire with their Bradley assault rifles, and we were already pulling back. I turned to make tracks to the rear and get reinforcements, but..

..THEY..

..were in front of us.

VamPonies.

K: "They're behind us!"

Misty: "They're all AROUND us, General!"

I levelled the Chaffee at the nearest one, and fired. That took its head clean off.. and it fell over to its side. Then, it got back up. I could see the wound regenerating.

K: "Science.. is fucked." I dropped the Chaffee, and pulled the Sword of Rainbow's Light. "GET CLOSE TO ME!" They pulled VERY near me. "CELESTIA, GIVE ME STRENGTH!!"

I instantly tasted cinnamon, and the ENTIRE forest lit up as though the sun was rising - and all the VamPonies poofed into ash, dead and permanently gone. I instantly felt weak, but I pushed them ahead of me, running for the Tortum of the East Gate.

K: "ALARM! ALARM! INVADERS AT THE EAST GATE!!" I screamed as we got closer.

No one was there.

K: "Radio!" I held my hand out, and Misty handed me her radio. C> "Alpha Actual to all callsigns - CODE RED! CODE RED! Invaders have entered the Capital! Secure all VIP's and lock down the city!" I looked at the two Guards. "Seal the Gate, and lock yourselves in the Guard House." I peeked in, as the alarms throughout the city started going off, making sure nothing was inside that might eat them. "All Clear. Get in, STAY in, and don't come out until Dawn, or I come for you personally, got it?"

Misty: "Yes, General!" She had to almost drag Silk inside - she wanted to help and was protesting. "Hey, Silk, General's a bit freaked out, and our rifles did nothing - you want to get your blood sucked?"

Silk: "N-No, ma'am!" She sealed the door behind them.

I was left standing there, with a very warm sword.

Luna: C> "Luna Actual to Alpha."

K: C> "Luna, go for Alpha."

Luna: C> "What is going on, My General? Why are you call-"

The transmission was cut off.

K: C> "Luna Actual! Come back!" I paused, hearing nothing. C> "All Callsigns - Eyes On Luna Actual, come back!" Nothing. That meant the radio antenna in town was disabled - instead of a hand unit, I'd need a full radio pack.

I started walking, holding the sword, and staring at every single shadow that was cast by the moonlight. I knew the girls would react as I'd taught them - get everyone to cover, analyze the situation, and start reacting to the threat. Once they realized this was a magical menace, they'd go for their Tiaras and make with the magic blast.

With Luna empowering them, it shouldn't take them long to fire off a big magic burst, and flatten these monsters.

Problem is, I made it about four blocks, and saw nothing. I could hear screaming, yelling.. intermittent, civilians that the guards couldn't reach in time. I heard a hiss from the darkness, and whipped around towards it.. and saw..

K: "You're a Changeling." I cocked a brow - that backstabbing, lying-

Changeling: "Misshtreshhhh.. thisshh wayyy.." It carefully formed the words.

It then started hopping, low, and going towards the north. At this stage, I didn't have anything to lose. In the back of my mind, I thought Chrysalis was attacking with VamPonies, for some reason, and this was her trying to challenge me to a one-on-one for the lives of ponies I cared for.

I could not have been more wrong.

We arrived at a small building with the door forced open. She leaned out, wearing a dress that looked like moss, and grabbed me around the neck, pulling me inside.

Chrysalis: "Thank ME, you're alright!" She actually hugged me.

K: "What the hell is going on?!" I hissed, in low tones.

Chrysalis: "I'd say 'you wouldn't believe me if I told you' but I know you, K, you'll believe me." She huffed a bit. "Lady Bezinda Batzory is here. Tirek summoned her to.." She looked out the window. "..assassinate you and the Elements."

K: "And why are YOU here?" I tilted my head.

Chrysalis: "I told you before, I'm not fighting you any more. She.. came to me and offered to split Equestria and the Crystal Kingdom with me, in exchange for the help of my Horde." She crossed her forelegs. "While this would keep my Brood well fed, it would eventually deny me the Crystal Heart. She was told that everyone important must be executed - including Sunshine and Cadence. No Love Couple, no baby. No baby, no chance to secure the Crystal Heart." She shrugged. "Which means, I either help you, or she wins, Tirek wins, and eventually destroys me. Meaning, I lose."

K: "Sound logic." I tilted my head. "Tirek never did like you, did he?"

Chrysalis: "I told you, I bribed him with Cadence. It didn't exactly work. I'm not stupid, K----. I'm a major threat to him with Grogar and the rest dead or turned to your side. He WILL kill me, if he gets a chance - if he wins." She flicked her tongue in annoyance.

K: "Can your magic harm these things?" I looked at her and gave her a small nod.

Chrysalis: "Yes, it can. I'm Love/Vacuum aligned, these things are pure Darkness/Vacuum. Also.." She nudged the sword. "..you have the cure right there."

K: "How? Tell me how."

Chrysalis: "Ehhh.." She BLUSHED a bit. "..we would need to make a.. connection.. heh.. and, then, you can channel my energy into the Sword of Rainbow's Light. I can.. if we connect well.. divert a very large amount of power into the sword. Much more than Celestia and Luna individually. And you already used up Celestia's charge." She wagged her buggy hoof at me. "But it would only work.. if you.. were.. really.." She was squirming.

K: "I get it. I eject your power from the sword, and the vampires wilt. Like intense light over a plant. I'm guessing there's a reason the girls haven't done something?"

Chrysalis: "It's.. different.. it would turn all vampires back to their mortal forms, except her. She's much stronger than I am. But it would kill her army, and save everyone that's been bitten. Such is the power of Love."

K: "Can't I channel..? No, Cadence wouldn't be strong enough, and I already tapped the Crystal Heart to kill the Smooze Mutant.." I considered my options - and I didn't have any. "You know, when you kissed me, I knew this would happen." I shrugged, and started getting my coat off.

Chrysalis: "Really?!" She beamed and squee'd. And launched herself at me, knocking me flat on my ass on a sack of grain.. her buggy tongue exploring my mouth. "Gods, you taste so different.."

K: "..and this only works because you kissed me before I married Applejack.." I did the math - she planned for something like this.

Chrysalis: *MMmhhhmmm* "Yesss.." She was getting my pants down. "..oh, that's big.."

She licked it.. then entangled her entire tongue in it, flexing and slithering the tongue around it, moaning in pleasure, as she felt our connection start.

I had to admit, even before this, I was a bit curious about her. Seeing what she was like, seeing her true nature - not evil, but desperate and a force of nature - made my human heart want to help her. Heal her. Now, I was horny, and I wanted to hump her. But, that tongue.. dear Celestia..

Now, I will say, this felt like extra cheating. This was Luna's day, and my only hope to save her lie in fucking her ex-worst enemy. Not that Chrysalis wasn't.. really.. convincing about this..

Chrysalis: "I'ff been fantasizing a'out viss ffor ageff.." She can still talk with her tongue mummifying my rod.

The.. sensations were unlike anything I'd ever felt before. Wet, muscley, enveloping, flicking my slit.. her mouth opened, and I fired my first shot right into it. She carefully closed her mouth around it, and sealed it, sucking every last drop in. Finally, she released and pulled back, gently turning and tapping her flank.

Chrysalis: "This is.. so.. much better.. than I thought.." She was oozing bug juice from her loins.

K: "My God.. that.. really was incredible.." I took a moment, it'd been that intense. "..okay, I have to know.." I leaned forwards, and spread her open.

Grippers. There were grippers in there, after all.

K: "Well. This is going to be fun.." I coughed a bit.

Chrysalis: "I can flex them individually.." She giggled.

Then, she did, rippling them, and then playing chopsticks with her own internals.

Chrysalis: "Makes self pleasure fun.." She trilled. "..but so lonely."

I just.. stuffed myself inside. It was shockingly tight, and I could feel the little grippers bend back. Her eyes went to pinpricks as I just.. went all the way in with a pleasured groan.

She couldn't talk, I couldn't talk, we were reduced to rutting animals. I gripped her sharp horn, and realizing it had no nerve endings (not even magical ones, like a unicorn's), I just used it as a gentle handle for a moment, until I started pulling her hair. That REALLY got her going - Chrysalis is, of course, a massive freak in bed.

I just let myself go. All those dark and evil things I could imagine to do to a girl (pony), I did. Slapped her ass hard, pulled her hair, pulled her tail, choked her a bit, all the things I'd never do to a lover, because they hurt, and I love each girl I get with, in my own way. Not her, this was just total lust. Dirty, filthy lust.

I have no idea how many times each of us blew off, but I know I did both her 'reproductive canal' (really, it's just to lay eggs), and her 'waste canal' (anus). She orgasmed from all of it, so did I.

We.. finally finished about midnight...

Chrysalis: "I fucking want.. this.. again.." She was trembling. "..I don't care if Applejack or Luna wrap me up in bits and bridles, damnit.." She hugged me tightly. "..I wish I'd found you instead. You be my General, lead my brood, bed me.. love.. me." She was almost crying. "I can feel it. I can feel it, and.. I'm so charged.. but.." She gently pounded my bare chest. "..damnit, human. That love is fucking addicting. It's like a drug, like the best drug I've ever had, and I fucking want so much more, I want all of it.." She calmed down a bit and sighed. "..and I know, I know.. it'd feed us so well.. but.." She shook her head. "..this love isn't my love." She pecked my cheek.

K: "You're a fucking freak." I stated flatly. "That was the most intense sex I've ever had. But, I do feel pretty tired after that." I shrugged. "Talk to me." I started getting dressed.

Chrysalis: "We can get to her. She'll be in the throne room. We haven't heard any shooting or anything in the last hour, meaning she's already taken control. But, you channel my power into the Sword, that'll free the ones that've been bitten, and kill the rest." She shook her head. "Just, don't shoot any of them. You shoot them, they'll start bleeding and dying the second her control wears off."

K: "Does silver work?" I realized something. "Religious symbols?"

Chrysalis: "Silver, yes. Faith.." She shook her head. "..Celestia doesn't count."

K: "She's a living goddess, not a true immortal." I held up my cross necklace. "I have a feeling.. THIS.. will work."

Chrysalis: "What IS that?" She poked it gently.

K: "A cross, a symbol of my faith. Something.. I believe in." I nodded slowly.

Chrysalis: "You better believe pretty hard - you really don't have magic." She shook her head.

K: "I have a feeling, HERE, this is all the power I need. This world isn't like my own - things manifest here that don't in mine. I have a very strong suspicion that if I channel my Faith into this, it'll keep them warded off. I might even be able to kill them, but I'm not taking that chance." I mean, it made sense - Tiamat, after all, was proof that Gods could cross that barrier, and Somnambula was proof the barriers were.. spongy.

Chrysalis: "Okay. Let's do this. Now.. you'll have to trust me."

We marched for the palace. And along the way, I could see them, everywhere. In the shadows, looking at me, looking at her. Chrysalis brought a small horde of her soldiers along with, and they surrounded us. The lesser vampires did not desire smoke with them - they'd lose, and they knew it.

We got to the throne room, and I could see Luna was chained up, on the ground, and unconscious. I couldn't see the girls, or any of my friends. Some of the guards - turned - were standing in improper places, but looking semi-formal.

On the throne sat a pony that had Celestia's build. She had bat wings, a black coat, silver mane, and wore a red, tight dress. Her hooves were capped in bronze. Her lips were painted red, her face bald white.

Chrysalis: "Lady Batzory." She bowed to her. "I brought the human." She raised her head a bit.

Lady Batzory: "Ahh! Zo I zee!" Romanian accent? Fitting. "Jou come around to us, yes? Maybe Tirek spare you and your hordes." She snickered. "Iz good. He give me command here. Ze human's science no match for us."

K: "Only because I didn't know I'd need silver bullets to fight vampires." I shrugged. "And I wouldn't detonate the atom bomb in Canterlot with my friends still in the city."

Lady Batzory: "Qviet. I vill vant to.." She shuddered. "..feel your love skills, later. Co'sider it a bribe to keep your family alive." She snorted. "I hear, for a male, you can go several hours."

K: "Why is it everyone wants my dick!?" I stated, exasperated. "My God, isn't that bestiality, to you!?" I waved a hand at her.

Lady Batzory: "So is fucking donkey. I fuck donkey." She tittered. "And minotaur, and wolf.. and.." She shrugged. "..then I eet zem." She gestured. "You? I cannot. Tirek vant to kill you personally. After you kill his lover." Cozy. She stepped down from Celestia's throne and started to approach me.

K: "So, Tirek wants me dead. Is that all?" I shrugged. "I mean, after I fuck your undead brains out, that is."

Lady Batzory: "Maybe... I convince him to let me keepz you, if you pleazure me enough." She got right up to me and ran a hoof under my chin. "I expect three times a day, no less, two hours each time. You do me good, you live!" She laugh-talked that last bit.

K: "Oh? And why do you think I would?" I leaned in to her. "You see, in my world, you represent the ultimate evil. The Enemy." I ran my thumbs under my collar. "And I have just the cure for that." I flicked the cross out, about an inch from her eyes. "IN NOMINE PATRIS, ET FILII, ET SPIRITUS SANCTI, AMEN!"

Lady Batzory: *HIIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSSSSS* *NYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!*

She covered her ears and fell to the ground, slamming her eyes shut. I grabbed my sword, hidden under the chitiny wings and mossy dress of Chrysalis.

K: "CHRYSALIS, GIVE ME STRENGTH!"

I raised the sword above my head, and focused intently on the absolute passion we'd just shared, and to be honest, I got very erect again. I could feel her power radiate out of the sword like waves of pure energy.. all the guards fell to the ground immediately. Her broodlings shrivelled up, as they acted like mobile batteries for her. She exhuded her power into the sword freely, crying out when it started to hurt, but pumping everything into it anyway.

A gigantic green blast.. and it was over.

Luna even stirred.

Luna: "My General..!?" She lifted her head.

K: "Just a second, My Princess." I pointed the sword at Lady Batzory.

Lady Batzory: "HOW?! HOW YOU DO DIS?!" She screamed.

K: "Simple. The power of love. In a vacuum." I nodded. "Sucking your evil away, and replacing it with my love." I smirked. "Now, for you."

Lady Batzory: "No! YOU GET AVAY!" She slithered backwards along the ground, trying to escape me.

K: "Pater noster, qui es in coelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum; Adveniat regnum tuum, fiat voluntas tua in terra sicut in caelo. Panem nostrum cotidianum da nobis hodie et dimitte nobis debita nostra; sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris. Et ne nos inducas in tentationem. sed libera nos a malo. Pro regno; tua est virtus et gloria; nunc et semper." I chanted, in her face, holding the sword up, blade down, like a cross. I ended with the Protestant saying.. "For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever - AMEN!"

She instantly turned to ash, and poofed into dust.

K: "It fucking worked." I blinked.

Chrysalis: "Good!" *Thump* She fell over.
