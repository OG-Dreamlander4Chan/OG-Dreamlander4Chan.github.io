DATE: 3 Lunarius, 1001 C.S.

Lyra Heartstrings.. what could I say about her? That she had a crush on me? A few ponies had that - I think it's my exotic status, and the fact that I'm not an asshole. No, what I could go into, though, is her obsession.. with hands and feet. That.. that would fill a book all by itself. Lyra, it turns out, is something of a book worm in her own right - but she prefers occult novels, old legends, and tall tales. Basically, a walking library of what Ponies would consider junk books.

But, some of them, weren't so junky, as it turned out.

Lyra asking me over to her place had me suspicious. But, she promised Bon-Bon would be there, so I felt at ease. She and Bon-Bon had just completed their one-week Ranger Training Course, and as such, I suppose they wanted to get to know me better. Even though I had no official title, I was basically in charge of the entire concept of "Defense Procedure." Arriving at her home at about 7 in the evening, I knocked on the door..

Lyra: "OH! K! Ah di'int think ye'd come.." She said, in her very authoritative Irish accent (which always confused me).

K: "What'cha need, Lyra?" I looked over her head to see if Bon-Bon was home.. and catching sight of her going over to the kitchen set my mind at ease.

I DID NOT WANT A REPEAT OF THE PRINCESS DEBACLE!

Lyra: "Oh, well, I wahnt'd you tae see this.. com'in.."

In I stepped, and there on the floor of their living room, was a pile of interesting books. Most of them were only parts of books - some had been rebound in new covers, some hadn't. A few had no covers at all. Lyra went over and sat down on her couch (like a human would, ass down, legs dangling), and grabbed one up with her hooves. Using her telekinesis, she flipped through the pages until she came upon a drawing.. or an etching, I couldn't tell.. of what looked to be a human, with glasses. I recognized him immediately.

K: "That's.. Danny.. Danny Williams.. where did you get this?" I leaned in, examining it.

Lyra: "Who's Danny?" She looked at me, a bit confused.

K: "Danny was one of the main characters of.. well, Generation One of.. this is going to be hard to explain.." I scratched the side of my head.

Lyra: "Try meh!" She gave me a grin.

K: "On my world, you're a cartoon show. Like a movie or something, but every frame hand drawn, in your case, on a computer. A computer is a device that can make billions of mathematical calculations per second. And given the right instructions, it can create images. Images, once animated, become a cartoon. Add in writers, and you get a television show.. a television being a device that can display this animation, when broadcast from a central source." I tried to make that make sense..

Lyra: ".. that explains this!" She seemed overjoyed.

She pulled out another book.. and I recognized the art in it as being promo art of the Gen 1 characters, only.. it looked like they were carved into stone, with a distinctly Mayan-style artistic lien.

K: "Lyra.. where did you get these?" I carefully picked one up, and recognized a few of the ponies from their Cutie Marks..

Lyra: "Oh, here 'n there.. had some'a them since I were a filly." She shrugged.

K: "So.. you suspected humans existed.. and what, you've been.. interested in us?" I scratched my chin.

Lyra: "YES! Yes, so much.. I mean.. HANDS.. and FINGERS.. and why do you have toes? How many? I never seen toes b'fore!" She babbled.

K: "Whoa, Lyra, calm down.." I put a hand up.

I made the mistake of sitting next to her. She grabbed my hands with her horn telekinesis, and started examining every nook and cranny with her hooves.. an air of awe and wonder could describe her face. Or manic curiosity, one of the two. To be honest, her gentle plying of my hands was starting to physically arouse me, for no other reason than it was basically like having my hands in a gently vibrating field, while having them tenderly touched. I cleared my throat.

K: "Bon-Bon? What'cha doin'?" I called, hopefully.

Bon-Bon: "Oh, just making some tea... I'll be in there soon." She said, distracted.

K: "Oh, do hurry. I love tea!" *Nervous chuckle*

Actually, it was my main caffeine replacement, since no one ever designed a proper coffee machine here that could be used in the home. I used to drink a full pot a day. I was getting very uncomfortable.. but.. at the same time, I let her continue. Why? Well, I imagine that a Brony (one of the tamer ones) in the same situation with a less-than-enthused pony would beg all creation for the same respect I was giving her. And I wanted to, karmically, pass along that kindness. Just in case. Still...

K: "So, my hands are that fascinating, are they?" I asked, analytically.

Lyra: "Aye.. Ah'm.." *Sigh* "I wish't I had hands o' me own.." She was bubbling.

K: "Yeah, don't go psycho on me and try to cut mine off and swap th-"

Lyra: "Sometimes, ah lay awake in bed at night an' dream what'd be like tae have hands.." She cut me off, dreamily speaking, in a somewhat creepy and possibly aroused tone.

K: "Uh, Lyra.."

Lyra: "..and what'd be like tae be human. How ah could finally grasp mah teats.." *Seductive voice* She was panting, gently.

K: "Uhhh.. LYRA.."

Lyra: "..and do all them naughty things tae meself. Or.. or even have it wi' another human!" She looked at me.. and I could smell.. uh.. let's just say I'm dangerously close to something I didn't want.

K: "LYRA! Seriously.. I'm with Applejack!" I looked straight at her, but my tone was gentle.

Lyra: *Sweetly* "Ye can't stop me from fantasizin'.." She leaned in WAY too close.

K: "Lyra, you're making me very uncomfortable." I was serious with that.

Lyra: "Mm.. if I hae' hands, I'd be doin' more'n that." She was panting, for sure, now.

K: "Lyra, I'm not having sex with you. And if you don't stop, I'm going to tell Applejack and let HER deal with you." I stated in a fully serious, authoritative tone.

Lyra: "Ah'm sorry.. it's jus'sat.." She was hurt, and her fire seemed cooled.

K: "I think I understand.." I shrugged.

She was the Pony equivalent of one of the darker types of Bronies. The kind that buy plushies with large holes in them. The creepy kind. Not that they're bad people, just.. if the situation was reversed, they'd probably get the same reaction. Unless it's Lyra, and she isn't married, then they'd get what they want. Maybe. I wasn't sure, and I wasn't going to make guesses about it. But, I felt for her, because I could understand having a desire over something not physically possible at one time, myself, and how I'd feel if I had the chance to examine the object of my desire.

K: "..I'll let you examine my feet, if you want, but if you try anything sexual, I will do something you won't like." I was VERY firm about this.

Lyra: "Whot?" She seemed curious and surprised.

K: "I'll let everyone know you tried to rape me." I gave her a serious stare. "No sexual stuff. I mean it. No means no."

I did regret one thing: I should have brought Applejack with me. I felt like a rape victim waiting to happen. Granted, with the Princesses, I ended up consenting in some form or another, but still. I took off my boots and socks, to let her examine both of my feet..

K: "No licking." I was firm because.. no.

Lyra: *Dejected* "Oh.."

K: "Do you really have that much of a.. a fetish for hands and feet?" I shrugged.

Lyra: "Ah'd not call it a.. a fetish.. but.." She blushed.

K: "Then what?" I tilted my head.

Lyra: "Er.." *Cough* "..th' concept.. th' whole idea o' havin' actual FINGERS an' TOES.. i's been my dream since I were a young filly.." She blushed.

K: "Uh-huh, and besides the sexual stuff, why?" I gave a one-arm shrug.

Lyra: "So's I could do thin's.. you know.. stuff nopony can do wi'out them?" She blinked.

K: "Things I take for granted." I said with a realization.

Lyra: "Aye! I.. ahh.."

She looked intently at my feet. And I think she got this 'now or never' idea in her head, and she did something to me that only my wife knew turned me on - she started giving me a foot massage (with her horn magic, of course). I started bucking like a fucking bronco that'd just been tazed. Dear GOD it felt good... it'd been ages since I'd gotten a proper foot massage. Or.. really.. any. I've always enjoyed them. I moaned. I moaned hard.

K: "L-Lyra.." My breath was going shallow.

Lyra: *Shhh* She hushed me.

K: "L-Ly-yra..!" I was breaking up.

Lyra: "Hesh, ye.." She said in a low, raspy tone.

I couldn't stand it anymore.. it was just.. so, so good. The sensation, the feeling of having all those sensitive nerves and muscles in my feet massaged is what my wife and I often did as foreplay (both ways). I slumped in the sofa, my guilt riding up the back of my head, when I felt her mouth slide around my big toe.

And SUCK on it.

Not that I could move, mind you, she had my feet telekinetically stuck there, and the pleasure sensations had me otherwise paralyzed.

I relaxed, and let her work me over like a cheap fiddle. She sucked each one of my toes individually, licked the bottoms of my feet softly and tenderly.. drank some carrot juice, and started in on my hands and fingers. By the time she was done, she'd sucked each one of my digits like they were miniature cocks. If I could have, I would have cum from each of them, she was so good. I could tell this was something she'd thought about constantly for a VERY long time.. no, fantasized about. And the end result had me beyond rock hard. I couldn't.. move, really.

K: "Alright, Lyra.. you did it. You pushed me too far.." I said, my eyes shut.

Lyra: *GASP!* "I-I'm sorry!" She was suddenly scared.

K: "You want a human, get rid of Bon-Bon. And.." *Harsh whisper* "..anyone finds out? You raped me. I will ruin you." I glared at her.

Her eyes lit up like exploding stars. I couldn't believe her reaction to this - I was about to give her everything she wanted (and cheat on Applejack, to fulfill her greatest dream). And she was ready to explode in squeegasm as a result. She zipped off to the kitchen just as the teapot started to whistle, and the next thing I heard was their back door closing.

I won't describe what happened next, but we made love, the kind that you clean up with a mop and bucket. To say I fulfilled her every fantasy was an understatement. The next thing I knew, I was in bed with her, laying naked next to her, with her still fixed with a manic smile. Her eyes were the size of periods, from all of this. And if I'd had more energy, she probably would have done a lot more than she did to me.

Lyra: "That.. that was.." She panted.

K: "THAT never happened, and if you TELL anyone, I will say that you raped me, and I will utterly destroy your reputation. Understand? I did this for you - because I understand how it feels to have something that will never happen, and have it so close, you can almost touch it." I nodded.

Lyra: "Cahn Ah ask what?" She cuddled me.

K: "I wanted to be a computer technician, an expert on them, like my father was. I got the education for it and everything - certification, degree, all that, but then the bottom dropped out of that job market right after I finished school. I was stuck with a massive debt, no employment prospects, and no ability to get a job. I tried getting cheap jobs -  stuff like waiter and all that - but I got told every time that I was either overqualified, or too inexperienced, or that my lack of a job history while I focused on my studies, hinted that I was unemployable or untrustworthy somehow. All kinds of horrible things. Then, as time went on, I couldn't afford to go back to school and learn how to work with the new things that came out. My skills went stale, and I became completely unable to get work." I nodded.

Lyra: "Tha's horrible - an' I din'nae mean to be a downer, but whae that gotta do wi' kinky sex stuff?" She rest her head on my chest.

K: "Nothing, but it was a dream I held close to my heart from the time I was six, and I'm still jealous that I'll never be able to do. So.. I granted your wish instead. It's not fair that -everyone's- dreams get crushed.." I looked away from her as she scooted in and placed a gentle hoof under my chin.

Lyra: "Ahnd Ah thank ye.. more'n you could ever know.."

She kissed me on the cheek, gently. We hadn't kissed at all during our fuck fest, actually. I considered kissing a sign of real love, so.. that I could never do for her.

Lyra: "Look't this way, yer workin' for Equestria, airen'cha?" She was just a tad sassy with that.

K: "I guess.. but I'm not exactly earning pay here, and it's not like you even have computers in the first place for me to work with. I'm working with funds set aside by Princess Celestia to make this whole military thing work." I shrugged.

Lyra: "Aye, an' Celestia feels you're worth everythin' you spend on yerself." She nodded affirmatively.

K: "I suppose. But I still feel guilty about it. I feel guilty about a lot of things." I sighed.

Lyra: "Issokay.." She hugged me. A friendly hug. "You gave me more than I could've ever wanted.. ever dreamed for.." Another kiss on the cheek. "An' fer that, I'll always be grateful."

K: "I gave you nothing that you'll ever admit to any other pony, in the history of forever, got it?" I looked into her eyes, so she knew I was serious.

Lyra: "Got it. But it were still wonderful.." She dreamily drizzled.

I got out of bed, washed my feet (don't ask), and got dressed again. Then I went back to her collection of books and started giving them a serious examination. It struck me odd that these things were here - did that mean that Generation One actually happened sometime in antiquity? If that was the case, maybe Celestia knew about it. I was determined to find out.

K: "Take care, Lyra. I'm heading out - and I'm borrowing some of you books." I called back to the bedroom.

Lyra: "OKAY! JUS' BRING 'EM BACK WHEN YER DONE WI' EM!"

K: "I will." I said, before departing.

And I went right over to Twilight's house. Right over to her lectern with her spare paper, and got out her feather pen. It was late, Twilight was asleep. So, I lit a candle, and started writing..

'Princess,
I've discovered some ancient tomes that hint at something that may have happened before. We must speak immediately, in person, about this. I feel it may have grave consequences for our immediate future.
~K'

I woke up Spike, and had him burn it off. I got a response in minutes, as I suspected. Princess Luna's carriage arrived moments later, with a sleepy Steelhoof leading it.

K: "Steelhoof." I nodded to him, closing my coat.

Steelhoof: "K? This is so important it can't wait for morning?" He asked, in a soldierly-griping tone.

K: "Yes, I'm afraid it is." I shrugged.

Steelhoof: "Get in, then." He nodded.

I got in the carriage, and held on as Luna's Guards flew me to the palace. Once we landed, I ran straight for Celestia's bedchambers - I knew she'd have been asleep. I hated waking her, but this was important. Lyra may have given me a major piece to the important puzzle that was facing us.

K: "Princess." I gently prodded her wing.

She awoke instantly, but her tone and visage was of motherly concern.

Celestia: "K? This couldn't wait for the morning?" She asked, quietly.

K: "No, I'm afraid not." I shook my head.

I showed her the tomes, everything that Lyra had that mentioned Generation One, or the appearance of Danny and the other two humans.

K: "Do you remember any of this?" I asked, showing her the things.

Celestia: "No, I don't. I never met them.. but I do remember Dream Valley.." She nodded, having sat up, and slid next to me.

K: "Where is it?" I looked to her.

Celestia: "Why.. we're on the very edge of it!" She said, as though I should know.

K: "You mean to say.. this is Dream Valley? That Canterlot was erected on the edge of Dream Valley?" I was confused.

Celestia: "Yes! Yes, I recall.. but this was so, so long ago.." She lowered her head.

K: "How long? Do you remember?" I gestured to her.

Celestia: "..no, that's the problem." She sighed.

K: "Princess Celestia, forgive me as I know it's rude to ask a lady her age, but how old are you?" I asked, slightly joking.

Celestia: "I.. don't remember.. ten of thousand of years, maybe?" She shook her head.

K: "Are you serious?" I cocked a brow.

Celestia: "Every few thousand years, I go through a renewal. It cleanses me of anything negative I've picked up. I also go through this.. if I've been killed. And I know I've died unnaturally before.." She frowned.

K: "Luna, too?" I looked towards the doorway.

Celestia: "Yes, Luna, too." She nodded.

K: "And.. you don't retain memories very well between these renewals, do you?" I shook my head.

Celestia: "Bits and pieces, but.. no, not very much." She sighed.

K: "This is why I like being mortal.. see, I won't forget you, ever. Even as I die, I'm certain I'll see your face one last time." I smiled warmly to her.

Celestia: "Oh, K.." She put her hoof around my shoulders. "I don't think I'll ever forget meeting you. Or.. well.." She blushed a little.

K: "You don't think.. but you don't know, either." After a moment, I waved my hand. "I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend.."

Celestia: "No, it's okay." She shook her head.

K: "No, no, I'm the one who should be sorry. I can't imagine what it must be to be a goddess.. and know that all the friends you make, you'll lose over time. And all you have, is Luna. The years without her must have driven you insane." I sighed.

Celestia: "I took it day-to-day.. then Twilight came along.." She trailed off.

K: "I see." I nodded. "Still, this raises a lot of questions that don't have any easy answers."

Celestia: *Giggle* "I trust you'll lead us on the path we must go.. and overcome this.. somehow."

K: "Got a feeling?" I smiled to her.

Celestia: "You could call it that." She smiled back.

I left the palace after greeting Luna, and went right back to the farm. Since Applejack's house was too small for me, I slept on a mattress in the barn loft. Not that I cared, I'd slept in worse places. Applejack sometimes slept with me. Tonight, she'd waited up for me. Or, tried to. I failed in my task of not disturbing her while getting into bed.

AJ: "OH! Honeybun.." She lolled over me as I got into bed.

K: "Sorry, Applejack.. I tried not to wake you." I kissed her forehead.

AJ: "Issokay.. been to th' palace?" She snuggled close.

K: "Yeah, how did you know?" I smirked.

AJ: "Y'smell like Princess Celestia.." And nuzzled me.

I curled up with her. I had betrayed her trust in me, and I felt horrible for it, but I'm sure that she would understand once I explained. That, once again, I was giving of myself for someone else's sake.. helping a friend. I'd tell her one day soon. But, for now, I was just grateful for the feel of her warmth next to me.
