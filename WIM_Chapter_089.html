Part 1: Guiding Gilda

TIME: 05:35 MST
DATE: Thursday, 11 March 2004
LOCATION: K's House, Canterlot, Colorado, USA

I woke up with Sunset naked and intertwined with me. To be honest, we'd been banging almost every day. Her, curiosity. Me, getting my fill of human-on-human sex. A small part of me wondered if it'd be better if I moved here, after the war was over, if I survived it, if I could not return to my Earth. Yes, I had Applejack, and I was madly in love with her, and we had a family..

..I was confused, though. More, concerned. That perhaps I was a corrupting influence after all, and me going into self-imposed exile in a realm similar to my own, might be the safest thing for my family. That no insane power-hungry inter-dimensional monsters, or something, would come there, if I wasn't there. Despite the Doctors trying to assure me otherwise.

I wondered if I'd become a "magnet for trouble" like some Superheroes end up being, in comic books - that, trouble seems to find them, because they are who they are. And they have a terrible choice to make - leave their home, so as not to endanger those they love the most, or stand and fight, and possibly lose them as collateral damage. I couldn't stand the idea of that happening to me, or Equestria.

Today, we were going to try and track down Grogar.. and get to Gilda and see what was going on with her. I couldn't kill her, but I could tenderize her, if I had to. I'd rather not, but, if it came down to it.. she WAS packing heat.

I was thinking back to Gilda's essential core personality. What was it that made Gilda, Gilda? Spirit of competition.. fierce loyalty to those she sees as friends..

..oh, God..

Kay: "Sunset. Wake up." I nudged her.. off of me.

Sunset: *Mrrfhhh* "Come ON.. you're so comfy!" She complained, but got up. "Man, last night was wild.." She smirked. "I didn't think you liked my tas-"

Kay: "I think this Gilda has a massive Furry fetish, and we're going to blackmail her." I said, rolling over, and going for my clothes.

Sunset: "WHAT?!" She was stunned, but.. she started getting dressed, herself.

Kay: "Think about it - this world preserves core personality traits of the original entities. If you can call Equestria the 'original' world, that is." I got my pants on, and fixed my CCW holster for my Glock 19. "Gilda has a huge fetish for non-Griffon species, and she's Lesbian.. well.. 99% Lesbian, I was an exception, BECAUSE I'm non-Griffon." I pointed a finger at her. "Something.. some.. small part.. of those sexual deviances are going to be in THIS Gilda. And if it's especially humiliating, she's going to go to any lengths to hide it. It's a weakness. If people KNEW she was a freak, they'd lose all respect for her."

Sunset: "So, how do we find out?" She tilted her head.

Kay: "Break into her place and look for evidence." I smirked.

Sunset: "That's CRAZY! She could call the co-" She blinked. "-she wouldn't call them if she's a criminal."

Kay: "Exactly. She'll try to deal with us herself. I think I can take her in a hand-to-hand fight, but it won't be pretty. So, we need to get sneaky." I smirked.

Sunset: "This is so crazy, it just might work." She blinked.

Kay: "Come on - let's get Pinkie and Sunny." I got up, now dressed, and once she was as well, we made for the door.


TIME: 06:12 MST


Sunny: "That's crazy!" He laughed, though. "I love it!"

Pinkie: "Actually, Kay, this is a really good idea, to deal with her without hurting her." She shrugged.

Sunny: "Yeah." He shrugged. "So, we blackmail her.. then what?"

Kay: "Make her give recorded testimony about what Grogar's been doing." I nodded. "It'll technically be under duress, but we can just make her say that it isn't. Once we have dirt on Grogar, we can go after him. Go from Grogar - and probably Bray, too - to either Scorpan or Tirek, and one will have dirt on the other. Gather all the evidence, and bring it to the State Attorney General's office, and the State Police." I gestured a bit. "It's an election year - taking out Scorpan would guarantee re-election to the other side, they'll bite eagerly, and fast-track the arrests or the news story about it."

Sunny: "Then you'll have accomplished your mission.." He nodded a bit.

Kay: "We. We, Sunny." I put a hand on his shoulder.

Pinkie: "Speaking of which, Sunny." She embraced him from behind. "I want us to get married when this is all over."

Sunny: "What?!" He staggered a bit, but she held him.

Pinkie: "I'm serious!" She played with his cheeks a bit. "It's not like you'd end up dating Governor Cadence, you know."

Sunny: "That was out of left field.. but.. okay." He shrugged. "I don't know why, but.. I feel really okay with this idea."

No, that message was to me - Cadence was the one threatened by Scorpan. Since Celesita and Luna were staff at the High School, Cadence being in another position of authority made sense. I wondered where Sombra was.


TIME: 07:27 MST
LOCATION: Gilda's House, Canterlot, CO.

Gilda had left already, by the time we got there. It made sense - this house was trashy, tiny, and probably only used for sleeping and keeping her possessions. It wasn't her headquarters. It also gave her a fall-back position, if the cops came snooping around.

Kay: "Sunny, you stay posted up outside with Sunset. Pinkie and I are taking this one. If Gilda or one of her flunkies comes back, call my cell phone, I'll have it on vibrate. We'll Ex-Fil and try again later, if we have to." I said, going over EVERY POSSIBLE Hero Mistake that could be made, here.

Sunny: "You got it." He smirked. "Man, this is fun! This is a LOT better than guarding a gate or going on a boring patrol."

Kay: "I suppose so." I patted him on the shoulder. "Remember, no shooting. The guns are an absolute last resort. Stay alert. We don't know who knows what about what's going on, and we can't assume we're fully in the advantage, here."

Sunny: "You got it." A nod.

Pinkie and I slipped out, and made our way over towards the side of the house.

Kay: "When are you going to tell him everything?" I asked, plainly.

Pinkie: "After you leave." She sighed. "He's had it rough. Rougher than Sunshine." She DID see them as two distinct people - interesting. "He has a lot of love in him, though. I.. I can't help it. I mean, I probably would have gone for him if Shining hadn't died and he'd been available." She blushed.

Kay: "That's so sweet, Pinkie." I said, getting to the window. "Okay.. chaos powers, get us in." I nodded to it.

She pulled out a straw, and wedged it between the window gap, and threw the latch. There were no bars on the window or anything protecting the latch from this kind of attack. We were in.

We were very careful not to disturb anything. We wore cotton gloves, so we wouldn't leave prints, too. We found her computer right away - it was hard-lined to her router. Now, this.. this is something I had an education for. I popped the side of the case, carefully, and checked the hard drive. Standard Seagate 250GB drive.. nothing special going on inside, she didn't know I.T.

I replaced the side of the case, and turned it on. Windows 2000 - we were in business, I was trained on that OS specifically. It was password protected, though.. which was not actually a problem, as there was an administrator account as well, specifically to get the computer up and running if something went wrong. I accessed this, and found it WASN'T password protected. Perfect.

I went right to her Browser History. And.. oh, God.. she was a hard core Furry. In this day and age? Absolute humiliation. She was also into bondage, Dom/Sub (with female subs and male Doms), and other stuff. Nothing illegal (which, I thanked God, I didn't have to handle THAT hot potato), but certainly fringe shit that would humiliate her and destroy her public image.

I recorded all of this, and made a shadow copy of her porn folder, preserving all the pointers and account information. She even had a .txt file with her passwords to various fetish sites, which I made a duplicate of. I'd explore her fetishes later, see if she posted anything else. I also grabbed a copy of her Digital Camera dump folder.. which had a TON of selfies in it, of her doing depraved things.

I powered off the computer, tapped Pinkie, and we slid right back out the window, relocked it, and made it back to the cars.

Kay: "Gilda's a kink queen with a submissive streak longer and wider than the Grand Canyon." I smirked. "She also fancies herself a bird anthro." I looked at Sunset as if to say 'Kinda makes sense, huh?'

Sunny: "You got the goods, then?" He smirked.

Kay: "TONS of evidence. TONS." I grinned broadly. "Come on, let's get out of here."

Now, to confront her..

Part 2: Guilding Gilda

TIME: 11:11 MST
DATE: Thursday, 11 March 2004
LOCATION: Ponyville Heights, Colorado, USA

Her base of operations was the town right next to Canterlot. I would note, for anyone wanting to look at a real map, this location matches up with "Canon City, Colorado." It seems, this world just replaced it, part and parcel. In this case, "Prospect Heights" (which had dissolved in 1990 in my world) survived as "Ponyville Heights."

We spotted Gilda and her gang, hanging on the porch of a brownstone that was likely their stash house. I could only assume they were dealing, and it was probably low level stuff. Marijuana, Extacy, other party drugs like that.

Kay: "Okay.. listen up. I'm doing this alone. You all need to be ready to back me up if this goes south. You hear a gun shot? You light those suckers up, and give me cover as long as you can so I can get away." I swapped my Glock 19 for the much smaller Makarov, which I slid into my underpants.

Yeah, I was going for "extra deep" concealment.

Sunny: "We gotcha. Heavy artillery?" He smirked.

Kay: "The heaviest we've got. But, the second you hear sirens, vamoose. Got me? And I absolutely mean it - we cannot afford to get tangled up with the local Ell-Ee." I wagged a finger at him.

Sunny: "Alright.." He nodded slowly. "I suppose if you get caught, someone has to be available to bail you out."

Kay: "This is the risk I was talking about, Sunny." I shrugged.

Sunny: "We got'cher back. Right girls?"

Sunset & Pinkie: "RIGHT!"

I kissed Sunset on the cheek, patted Pinkie on the arm, got out, and walked up the street.

*Please note, that until I state otherwise, all of my speech from here on out, is in my natural Chicagoan accent. Yes, I do actually sound a bit like a Guido, but the accent is fairly light.*

Punk: "Hey. You. What'chu doin'?" He said, catcalling me from the porch.

Kay: "I'm here to see Gullwing.." I stared lasers at Gilda. "..I mean, Gilda." I smirked.

She turned red as fire.. visibly started sweating.. and stood up.

Kay: "In private." I pointed away from her gang.

Punk: "G.. you want us to take care of him?" He raised his head.

Gilda: "No, you bird brain!" She hissed. "He's here on business!" She snorted at me. "Inside."

I paced forwards.. one of her punks, who I quickly recognized as Goreham, patted me down a bit, but not where I had the Makarov hidden. Now that I got a good look at these punks, it was all Goreham and Gorosbif's crew.. minus Gorlamb and Gorcat.

We got inside, and she led me upstairs. Once we were in a small back apartment, she let me enter first, and shut the door.

We both whipped around, guns drawn.

Gilda: "Smart." She smirked. "Where'd you hide that?"

Kay: "Small gun, massive cock." I smirked.

I was lying about the massive part, okay? Come on, I'm getting a chance to do cheesy action movie lines, and I was taking it!

Gilda: "How do you know-"

Kay: "Cut the crap. I have everything on you. I know what you like. I know what turns you on. I know that I.." I stepped towards her. "..have a unique advantage.." And slapped the gun out of her hand, letting it clatter to the floor. "..over you.." And jammed the Makarov up under her chin.

Then I 'forced' her to kiss me.

I was replaying one of her fantasy hentai mangas, almost shot-for-shot.

She melted instantly.. heaving breaths.. hands shaking.

Kay: "Ah-ah.." I whispered into her ear. "..I haven't made you my bird bitch, yet.."


TIME: 15:24 MST


When we came back out, I was dressed perfectly fine. She was an absolute mess. I just led her past her cronies.

Kay: "Your ex-Boss is my bitch, now." I stated, standing before them.

Gilda: "..it's true." She looked defeated.

For appearances sake, she'd insisted I slap her around some while we.. did things.

Goreham: "The FUCK you on about!?" He stood up, and tried to get up in my business.

I raised my right hand.. and Sunny, Sunset, and Pinkie slipped from around the side with their rifles aimed low.

Kay: "That's what I'm on about." I nodded. "You work for me, or you get fitted for a body bag. Make your choice."

Every one of them put their hands up.

Kay: "Much better." I slipped a hand into Gilda's pants, to assert my dominance. "Now, then. Gilda tells me Grogar has something for you guys this evening. That's fine. We'll make the appointment." I pulled Gilda's SIG P228 from behind her back, and wagged it around a bit. "But, if I find out one of you backstabbed me, and ratted to him that I took over before tonight.. I'm going to make you beg for death."

Gorosbif: "Fine. What do we do until then?" He snorted.

Kay: "Business as usual. Oh, and cut the price of the pot by a buck, hm? Sale today. To celebrate my conquest. Don't worry, boys.. you do good by me, I'll do damn good by you." I smirked. "And Gilda's going to be my guest until this evening. She'll text you when it's time to go."

*At this point, I drop the accent*

TIME: 15:54
LOCATION: K's House, Canterlot, CO

We walked in, and I just about tossed the disarmed Gilda to the sofa.

Kay: "Let me put it this way, Sunset." I nodded to Gilda. "Show her your collar, little bird." I smirked

Gilda showed off the cat collar I'd fixed to her neck. And locked there.

Kay: "She's a secret submissive into all kinds of humiliating things." I shrugged.

Sunset: "You.." She looked at Gilda. "..REALLY!?"

Gilda: "Shut up!" She sneered.

Kay: "Gilda.." I looked at the floor.

Gilda: "Sorry, Master.." She slid down on all fours and crawled over to me. "..please, I'm sorry."

I pet her head, and she made imitation happy bird noises.

Sunset: "This is crazy!" She laughed. "Really!?" She paced over to Gilda. "The Mighty G.. and you like to be put in your place."

Gilda: "Yes, Mistress." She stood up, though. "However, Master told me you'd want to.."

Kay: "Sunset? You told me you had some fantasies." I nodded to Gilda. "Assert your Dominance. I'm.. I'm good." I sat down to watch.

As it turned out, this world reflected Gilda's more.. perverted side as a massively closeted fetish monster. Had she been a few years later, this would have been more widely accepted and she could have gotten away with being a huge perv. But, 2004? No, no, not yet.

And to be perfectly honest, my fan friends, MLP:FiM played a role in making odd fetishes more mainstream in various sub-cultures. WE made the world, or rather, influenced a small part of it.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Grogar Gains

TIME: 18:47 MST
DATE: Thursday, 11 March 2004
LOCATION: Cloudside, Colorado, USA

This, more or less, replaced "Brookside, CO."

This, however, was a slum, to say the least. All small houses, on small properties. I've never been to my world's version of this place, but this didn't seem quite right.

The Griffons were now at my back. As I explained to them, I was a "wiseguy adjacent" that was out on my own, but would ultimately pay tribute to The Chicago Outfit if I was successful, here. That The Outfit would see to our more advanced needs. That Grogar was leading them into a trap..

..pointing out that Scorpan was Grogar's boss, and Scorpan would make darn sure that they were removed as a possible source of embarrassment the second he took office, just before starting to fulfill his campaign promises of being softer on criminals. That a man like him, could not afford any 'connections.'

This being right on the cultural heels of the "Don't Trust The Government" era of the 1990's, they ate it like Sunday Dinner. I made it clear, though, that this had to be played just right, and I needed things from Grogar before we got rid of him.. for everyone's sakes, since, if Scorpan simply lost the election, he'd go after them anyways for failing and betraying him.

A big criminal risk, but it would make The Griffons an outlet of a much more powerful Mafia group, if we won. Which assured all of the small gang higher positions as they expanded, more money, and more respect. So they thought, anyway.

We came armed. I expected Grogar to have a couple body guards. I didn't expect him to have his own foot soldiers. I was.. rather wrong about that.

Gilda: "Grogar!" She paced forwards, as we met just off a trail, on the south-west corner of Cloudside.

Grogar: "Gilda.." He smirked as he stepped forwards - I noted he had a soul patch beard that vaguely resembled Goat Grogar's goat beard.

Gilda: "What's all this?!" She gestured to his mooks.

Grogar: "Oh.. nothin'.." He smirked.

Kay: "You're going to kill us." I shook my head, my Chicago accent coming back for the duration. "Dumb move."

Grogar: "Who the fuck are you!?" He said, realizing I was behind Gilda.

Kay: "Someone who needs something from you." I tossed out a briefcase containing $30,000. "I understand you're the man to see."

Grogar: "This isn't how this works!" He sneered.. then looked at the case.

Kay: "Yeah, yeah.. I know." I gestured. "You're supposed to make contact, talk to the intermediaries, get permission.." I shook my head. "I'm cuttin' to the chase, Grogar. I got money, you got something I want."

Grogar: "What's in there?" He looked at the case.

Kay: "Thirty G's." I nodded. "That's just a down payment." Implying I had a lot more.

Grogar: "..you fucking serious?!" Gee, what could I want so bad from him!

He went for the case, and carefully opened it. Indeed - $30,000 USD. He tapped one of the bill stacks on his hand, then stood back up, and wagged it at me.

Grogar: "Okay, who you frontin' for?" He started.

Kay: *Wry chuckle* "Who d'you think!?" I leaned into my accent, here.

Grogar: "Nah.. not Jim 'The Builder' Beamiano!?" He looked shocked.

I was a little sad that my friend Jim Beam was, it seemed, on the wrong side of the law.

Kay: "Ultimately. But, I'm here on my own. I'm lookin' to get established, and link up with Jim once I'm settled and got cash flow going." I gestured to the Griffons. "You've got 'em running party drugs and low level shit." I gestured to him. "Once Scorpan becomes governor.. let's just say.. some new markets might suddenly open, and I want to corner them."

Grogar: "You're talkin' sense. How do I fit into all this?" He resumed his Wise Guy pose.

Kay: "Simple." I moved Gilda out of the way. "The Griffons can't be the only gang you're running. Canterlot's pretty big.. Colorado Springs ain't too far from here." I gestured. "I need a local guy that's got contacts. People that can move product. I know a pipeline we can get said product from, but I need a talent manager."

Grogar: "Oohhhh.. oh, I get what'cher sayin'.." He wagged the stack of bills at me. "I manage the talent, you manage the product, then.. business as usual on the rest of it, yeah?" Meaning, the gangs push the drugs, and flow the cash up the line.

Kay: "And when Jim gets involved, I'm point for him and his outfit." I stated, making it clear that I'd be the boss, ultimately. "Thing is, I take good care'a my people."

Grogar: "I like this." He bent down and closed the briefcase. "I'm guessing this here's a down payment on my employment, then?"

Kay: "More of a small gratuity." I implied far more money was in the offing, counting on his greed. "I got ten times that in my shaving kit, alone."

Grogar: "You an' me need to talk business, then.." He gestured for me to step closer.

I did.. and as I'd warned everyone, this was the most dangerous part of the whole show. I didn't know he'd have his own mooks, here - The Griffons matched them in numbers, and I had Sunset, Pinkie, and Sunny way in the back with scoped rifles. I suspected that this meeting was going to be Grogar ambushing The Griffons with his bodyguards - they'd be outnumbered, but they'd be professionals with fully automatic weapons.

I didn't move too far from Gilda, and when I did, I motioned for her to stay behind me.

Grogar: "You're'ah.. you're close to Gilda, there.." He noticed.

Kay: "We have a seperate, personal, agreement." I gave him a big wink - a very masculine boast, implying many things.

Grogar: "OH! Ohhhhh.. ahahaha!" He wagged a finger at me. "I gotcha, man, I gotcha." He leaned into me. "Problem is, my.. backer.. wants'em all dead." He flicked a look at her. "You got her under control?"

Kay: "Perfectly." I nodded. "You want her gang knocked off? Here, lemme make it easy on ya." I patted his shoulder. "Gilda." I looked back at her, like an abusive boy friend would to his kept woman.

Gilda: "Yeah, boss?" She moved up just a bit.

It was go time.

Kay: "NOW!" I kicked Grogar in the groin, grabbed him in a headlock, and cleared leather, just as Gilda did the same.

My first shots was into the face of his left hand bodyguard, who I knew, from the way he was standing, had his hands on a weapon under his coat. His mooks started shooting at about the same instant I did.

The Griffons followed suit.

I saw his right-hand bodyguard go down to Gilda's shots, and I dragged Grogar back with me. I needed him alive. Bullets flying past and over my head was nothing new to me, and Sunny would see just how disciplined I really was. I moved my sights to my next target, and fired four rounds into his chest, before I managed to get Grogar well behind our lines, and thump him a few more times, to knock the fight out of him.

I retrieved the tactical bag I'd stashed before we advanced to the meeting site, and pulled out rope. I bound Grogar up as best I could, restraining hands, ankles, wrists, and around his neck.

Gilda: "We got what we came for." She nodded, and she had the case in her other hand.

Kay: "Yeah, now we kill them." I nodded to the gun battle. "I promised the crew I'd look out for 'em." I said, pulling the Benelli from the tactical bag, and a pouch full of shells. "I don't abandon my troops." I stood up, and charged back in.

Once I got back on the battlefield with the Benelli, I started laying waste. I loaded with nothing but slugs, so each shot was a devastating kill or cripple. The Griffons' numbers were withering as fast as the enemy, but I kept it up. A sniper on the ridge above us drilled Goreham in the head, but they were silenced by my sniper team on the ridge to our back right.

I leveled the Benelli at one of the Mooks, fired, and watched him fold in half, dropping his weapon, and gasping for air. I shouldered, and fired on another, blowing open his chest. I took fire from a very rapid fully automatic to my left, dove down to my right, and started thumbing shells into the shotgun. Sounded like a MAC-10 to me.

I heard a gunshot from the far rear.. the MAC-owner fell, and spurted off a few shots as they did. I whipped back up, and took out two more Mooks as they came down from the side of the cliff face.. one had a TEC-9, one had a nickel-plated pistol. Both got two slugs each. I ducked back down, and topped off.

When I whipped back up.. I was greeted by silence. I stood up, scanned for targets, and saw nothing. My cell phone buzzed, and I yanked it out, and answered it.

Kay: P> "Talk to me." I carefully slung the shotgun, transitioned to my Glock, and started moving backwards.

Sunny: P> "Time to Ex-Fil. I can see blinking lights in the distance - they're coming from the north. Probably Canterlot PD."

Kay: P> "Take your truck and ex-fil to the west with the girls." I looked around. "GILDA!"

Gilda: "I'm alive!" She shouted.

Kay: P> "I'm taking Gilda, and going south. Meet up in Chandler." I instructed.

Sunny: P> "You got it. Oh.. and.. that was the most damned professional shit I've ever seen." He chuckled.

Kay: P> "No shit? Keep hanging around me, you'll see more." I shut off the cell phone, and moved over to Gilda. "Anyone left?"

Gilda: "No.. just you and me." She shook her head, letting Gorosbif down - he'd been shot five times.

Kay: "Let's go, then. South. Come on - cops are on their way. Grab Grogar." I moved to the enemy's rear, and found a very nice Ford F-250 Crew Cab in solid black - time to appropriate enemy goods!

We stuffed our prize into the Pickup's cargo bed, tied down with chains, and drove off, just as the sirens started being audible. As I had guessed, Scorpan delayed the police, thinking Grogar was going to eliminate all the Griffons tonight, and they'd need some time to work.

It also allowed us to get away scott-free.

Part 4: Boasting Braying

TIME: 19:01 MST
DATE: Thursday, 11 March 2004
LOCATION: Ghost Town of Chandler, Colorado, USA

Chandler. We'd planned our exfiltration to rendezvous here. Gilda and I arrived first, and we hauled Grogar out of the bed of the truck, in front of a ruined house. We dragged him inside, and sat him on a large, wooden chair.. and tied him directly to it.

Kay: "I'm sorry about your crew, Gilda.." I lowered my head. "..history won't remember them, but they gave their lives for a very noble cause." I shrugged. "They were my troops.. they died heroes."

Gilda: "Most'v'em were scummy somehow, anyway.." She held herself a bit. "..but they were the closest thing I had to a family."

Kay: "Don't worry. I'll.." I looked at Grogar. "..they didn't die in vain."

I ungagged him.

Grogar: "What.. the actual fuck.. d'you think'y're doing!?" He stated, angrily.

Kay: "I'm going to get some answers." I shrugged. "I want to bring down Tirek and Scorpan."

Grogar: "Are you DENSE!?" He shook his head. "Nah, you must be, or you wouldn't've just taken me." He squinted at me. "Gonna read me my rights?"

Kay: "I'm no cop. Not a Fed, either." I smirked. "I'm.. just a private citizen."

Grogar: "Then you better get me to a cop and have me arrested, you piece of shit, or-"

I shut him up by lifting my right leg, and kick-sliding the tip of my boot right to his crotch. I made contact, but not nearly at full force.

Kay: "Scorpan's the DA." I shrugged. "He'll have you released.. or killed." I sniffed. "Most likely killed."

Grogar: "No way. I'm his right hand!" He hissed at me.

Kay: "Yeah, and you got caught up to your neck in gangsters and a shootout massacre.. by a private citizen." I smirked. "How do you think he's going to take that, man?? YOU'RE the one that's DENSE if you think he's going to let you walk free, after that! You humiliated him - or, you would be, if you turned up alive." I could hear another vehicle approaching. "Gilda, sounds like our friends are here. Guide them to us, eh?"

Grogar: "You're dead." He simply stated.

Kay: "So are you, if you don't give me what I want. No, see, I will turn you over, if you don't talk. Directly to Scorpan. Then I'll tell him everything I already know - and tell HIM you told me, very eagerly." I shrugged. "You'll be dead in a week."

I heard gunshots.. not good.

Kay: "Stay put." I glared at him, and moved to the door. "Gilda!"

Gilda: "I'm pinned down! It's not Sunny and them!" She shouted from behind the pickup.

I saw a muzzle flash and an impact in the dirt near her.

So.. I.. slipped out of the house, and skulked around to the left. In the dying flickers of light, I stuck to the shadows. Easy enough. Whoever it was, would fire an occasional shot at Gilda, and she'd fire one back.. they were in a stand-off.

I saw Sunny's truck coming up from the north-west.. he saw what was going on, and stopped. He was going to deploy one of the rifles. No need. I had a bead on the shooter's location - he was behind a Chevy pickup. I slipped right up behind him, pulled out the Cold Steel OSS knife.. and grabbed him, pulling him back on the blade. Once I aced his renal artery, I pulled the knife out, jammed it into his neck, and punched out, tearing out his esophagus in the process.

He was dead before he hit the ground.

Kay: "You're clear, Gilda! You hit?" I called out, as Sunny and the girls approached.

Gilda: "I'm good!" She stepped out from cover.

Kay: "Go secure the prisoner, and tell him Bray failed his mission." I smirked, coldly, and wiped the blood off on Bray's jacket.

Sunny: "Damn.. I really ought to ask where the hell you trained.." He looked at me.. he'd seen the whole display.

Kay: "Here and there." I shrugged, and went over to high-five him and the girls. "We did it. We have Grogar."

Sunset: "Now.. we kinda need to make him talk." She sighed. "How do we do that without torturing him in a way that's going to show?"

Kay: "I can waterboard him, if I have to." I recalled that Waterboarding wasn't a commonly known term, yet.

Sunny: "Pshh.." He just shook his head with a grin. "Man, I wish I could put this on my resume - 'Helped a Spooky Spook do Spook Shit'."

Kay: "I wish you could, too, Sunny." I patted him on the shoulder. "Come on."

We went into the house.. time for answers.

Grogar had knocked his chair over, and was trying to drag himself away by digging his teeth into the floor, and pulling himself along.

I walked over and just.. righted the chair, and gave him a gentle slap upside the head.

Kay: "Don't.. don't be like that, Grogar. You look stupid as fuck." I sighed, as everyone came in.

Grogar: "Fuckin'.." He looked at everyone there - and was kinda surprised to see Pinkie. "The fuck you doing here!?"

Pinkie: "Hee-hee.." She grinned.. then her grin vanished, and her hair went completely straight.. she stalked over to him, and pulled her OSS knife out..

Kay: "Pink." I stated. "Pinkamena..!" I moved up to get between them. "PINKAMENA!"

Pinkie: "DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA.. WHAT YOU'VE DONE!?" She stormed at him.. loosely handling the knife.. more like a serial killer than a trained soldier.

Kay: "PINKAMENA!" I grabbed her shoulders.

Grogar: "What the FUCK is going on here!?" He tried to scoot his chair away.. Gilda blocked him.

Kay: "It's her split personality - caused by trauma. It.. it reacts to other people that've had that kind of trauma done to them, and.. it's like a protective personality - only, it KILLS!" I was.. really fighting her, and for a minute, legitimately wondered if it was Pinkamena and not Pinkie putting on an act. "Like Hannibal Lecter or some shit.. do you have any idea how much of her bloodshed we've had to cover up!?"

Sunny moved like he was going to help me, but I waved him back.

Kay: "No, Sunny! If she's fully cracked, she's not going to see you as a friend!" I shook her. "PINKAMENA!"

Pinkie: "Please. Please let me." She glared at Grogar. "YOU know what he's done.. what he's responsible for.." She heaved furious breaths. "It's not like MY knife is any sharper than the one Scorpan's going to send after him!" She growled, and ground her teeth together. "LET ME KILL HIM!" She shrieked. "HE'S NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU ANYTHING, ANYWAY! HE'S JUST MEAT! LET ME CARVE HIM!"

Kay: "PINKAMENA, NO!" I leaned in, and picked her up under her butt. "Gilda, watch him!" And carried her outside.. out of his eyesight.

Pinkie: "Is it working?" She whispered into my ear.

Kay: "I'm pretty sure it is." I gave her a friendly peck on the cheek. "Let's make this sound good, eh?" I tossed her against the side of the captured pickup, hard enough that her butt dented it.

Pinkie: "NOOOO! LET ME IN THERE! LET ME CARVE OFF HIS FLESH! YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID! YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO IF YOU LET HIM GO!!" She screamed, and kicked at the pickup. "LET ME CASTRATE HIM.. CASTRATE HIM AND SHOVE HIS BALLS INTO HIS EYESOCKETS.. AND SHOVE HIS EYES UP HIS SHITHOLE, SO HE CAN WATCH ME KICK HIS ASS!!" She jammed the OSS knife into the pickup's panelling and made god-awful grinding noises.

Kay: "PINKAMENA! CALM DOWN! WE NEED HIM ALIVE!" Pause. "NO, NO, GET BACK HERE!" Pause. "PINKAMENA, STOP! I'M NOT LETTING GO!" Pause, I threw myself to the ground as hard as I could, and grunted on impact. "GET BACK HERE!!" I grinned. "SUNNY, IF HE'S GONNA TALK, GET HIM TALKING FAST! I CAN'T FIND HER! IT'S TOO DARK OUT HERE!"

I started running around in random directions, and Pinkie did, too, letting her footfalls grow quiet every now and then.. and buzzing by the ruined house, slapping the walls.. or dragging her knife across them.

This went on for a couple minutes.. until...

Sunny: "HE TALKED! PINKAMENA! HE TALKED! STOP, PLEASE!" I could tell by his voice, he was totally convinced.

I moved back into visual range with Pinkie tied up.

Kay: "I just managed to catch her.." I put her in the bed of Sunny's pickup. "..damn, she's gotten stronger." I paced in, pretending to be out of breath. I sat on a broken crate, in front of Grogar. "Talk to me."

Grogar: "I-It's like I told them.. I'm takin' orders from Scorpan. Scorpan's takin' orders from Tirek. As far as I know, Scorpan wants to become Governor so the gangs I run for him, can start smuggling heavy ass drugs into this part of the state, and then he'll use the state cops and the feds to help him take over all the other cities." He was gasping for air. "And that ain't all - slave labor, prostitutes, human smuggling, you name it. Oh, he'll be soft on crime once he corners the market on it! And Tirek's the one running the show!"

Kay: "Nice, but that's not admissible without hard evidence - testimony of a single co-conspirator without further evidence of its veracity is inadmissible." I shook my head a bit. "I need something more, Grogar. I need.. a confession." I looked out the door.

Grogar: "I got a tape I made for insurance." He whined. "It's hidden, though. I got a trap house in Dragonvale.. kinda.. kinda a place I do some business. I got my own private room in there. It's hidden in the wall, behind a brick. Brick's kinda loose, but you have to wedge it out."

Kay: "What's on the tape?" I asked, plainly.

Grogar: "Tirek and Scorpan discussing with me how they're gonna be the Godfathers of Colorado. Exact details. And how they're gonna slime Governor Cadence, and people around her. Scandals they're gonna invent, using local girls.." He nodded to Sunset. "She was one of 'em they were gonna use - they were gonna frame the State Patrol Commander by saying he raped her, got her pregnant, and made her get an abortion."

Sunset: "Oh, my God.." She lowered her head, and leaned on the wall.

Kay: "And the State Patrol Commander is.."

Sunny: "..Colonel Sombra Blackheart." He finished the sentence for me. "Of course!" He snorted. "He's been one of the most stand-up cops this state has ever seen!"

Kay: "Right. Well." I shrugged. "We need to get this man to Colonel Blackheart." I looked at everyone. "Road trip."

Part 5: Crashing Down

TIME: 22:00 MST
DATE: Thursday, 11 March 2004
LOCATION: Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA

We stopped off at the trap house in Dragonvale. The tape was easy to find. I then got on the internet, and found out that Colonel Blackheart was staying in Colorado Springs for the next few days, attending a symposeum of Colorado Sheriffs.

It wasn't hard to figure everything else out, either. We had solid evidence, and we had someone that would be directly threatened if they didn't act. We drove to Colorado Springs. It took us 45 minutes to get there.

The hotel had shit security. Me and Pinkie got in through a loading dock for laundry that was left wide open. I dressed in something more formal - a "business casual" look, with a tie. I had the M-19 holstered in a fancy leather holster, canted, making myself look like a detective or something. Being in a building full of cops, I didn't expect to get challenged, if I looked like one of them. Add Aviator sunglasses flipped around to the back of my head, I looked like a total douchebag cop.

Perfect.

I had Pinkie trailing behind me, dressed fairly nicely (she hated it), so she looked more like hotel staff. There was no way I'd be able to have her pass as a cop - she looked too young. Despite me being physically 23, I looked older - I always had.

I got up to the front counter without so much as a look from anyone else.

Kay: "Hey.. where's Colonel Blackheart's room?" I asked the desk clerk. "I gotta message for him from his office - they says its urgent." I tapped a folded piece of paper on the counter, pretending to be annoyed.

Haber Dasher: "Ah.. he's in 112. Down the hall, to the right." He nodded.

It was nice to see Colonel Haber Dasher in a calmer job. I nodded to him.

Kay: "Thanks." I said, moving off, with the paper between two fingers.

Pinkie had obtained a maid's cart and a set of master keys. I didn't ask where from.

We got to his room, and I put an ear to the door. I could actually hear him snoring! He was out cold. Pinkie very quietly got the door unlocked, and I eased my way in. I could see the bed, and there WAS a lump in it.. but the lump wasn't moving. So, I carefully cleared leather, and spun around the corner by the bathroom.

Sombra was sitting in a chair next to the small bed, his own sidearm aimed right back at me.

Kay: "Paranoid, Colonel?" I asked.

Col. Blackheart: "For good reason, it seems." He looked at my M-19, and to me. "Who are you?"

Kay: "Kay." I nodded to him. "And right now, I'm your best friend." I looked down at the revolvers in our hands, and rolled mine to an un-ready position, hand off the grip, finger curled around the frame. "I'd like to talk."

Col. Blackheart: "..okay." He set his S&W Chief's Special down on the small table.

I set my M-19 next to it.

Kay: "Grogar, Scorpan and Tirek are part of a major criminal enterprise looking to take over the state, and use the police to eliminate their criminal rivals, then promote mass degeneracy among the public, so their own criminal gangs can run the show." I nodded. "I have Grogar prisoner. And I have a tape proving Tirek and Scorpan's involvement."

Col. Blackheart: "And you came to me.. why?" He tilted his head.

Kay: "Canterlot PD's suspect - so's Fremont Sheriff's. Scorpan's their DA. He's been letting certain people out, so they can do things for him. There was a huge gangland shooting earlier this evening - he had some loose ends that needed tying up. There's got to be over 20 bodies." I carefully slid the micro casettee recorder from my pant pocket, and slid it across the table to him. "They're also planning on sliming you with a false rape and kiddy touching allegation. They had.. HAD a girl that was a legit victim of that, but Tirek did it.. they were going to force her to name you, instead."

Colonel Blackheart looked at the recorder, and back to me.

Col. Blackheart: "Who do you work for?" He tilted his head.

Kay: "I can't explain that part, Colonel. Trust me, you don't have the clearance to know about it." I slowly shook my head. "Tirek is in possession of certain things that my side needs back. Mind you, I was just going to take them, recover our asset, and leave.. but, I couldn't. Not once I saw how deep this went." I looked to the side. "Pinkie."

She slid out from behind me.. and manifested a small black horse figurine in her hand.

Col. Blackheart: "JESUS!" He looked at it.. gently picked it up, looked it over.. and set it on the table.

Kay: "That's what my side is interested in. He's got things that can do things - you understand?" I tilted my head a bit.

Col. Blackheart: "I do." He nodded a bit. "I've had more than one odd thing happen to me over the years that I can't explain." He huffed a sigh. "Seems I shouldn't ask about it."

Kay: "But, you understand, now, why this is such a big deal?" I gestured a bit.

Col. Blackheart: "I do." He nodded firmly. "What can I do to help you?"

Kay: "Get the State Attorney General involved. Like, right now. That cassette is more than enough evidence to bury Tirek, Scorpan, and Grogar.. and round up all the pieces of their organization. I need warrants, though. I need authority - legit authority, not what I've got. And we need to hit them as soon as we possibly can. Dawn, if it's do-able." I nodded back to him.

Col. Blackheart: "Let me make some calls.." He nodded.. then nodded to my revolver, to retrieve it.


TIME: 06:24 MST
DATE: Friday, 12 March 2004
LOCATION: Canterlot, Colorado, USA

Tirek's office was at the School Administration Building. After Colonel Blackheart got the gears of justice turning, he officially deputized me. I had a search warrant. I had the pieces I needed to bring Tirek down.

Only took me a week! I suppose that's the advantage of being able to confine one's enemies within a set of rules that closely match the rules you've grown up with. You know them, your enemy must adapt.

The five of us entered the building - the front door wasn't locked, and the grounds crew that was working on the land wasn't paying any attention as they moved some heavy equipment up against the building. Given that Gilda's only connection was hearsay evidence by Grogar, Colonel Blackheart promised her a clean slate if she continued to help us. We marched down the hall, heavily armed. When we got to his office, we could hear him on the phone..

Tirek: P> "..going to be on their way any minute! It's all falling apart!" A pause. "I don't care! We're bust, here! We have to LEAVE!" Another pause. "This is on YOU! Grogar was YOUR man! I-"

I heard movement.. I leveled the HK91 at the door and fired five shots rapidly.. they were LOOOUUUD! Good thing we had earpro in!

Kay: "TIREK!" I yelled, as I kicked the broken door in, and rushed him.

He had a shattered phone receiver in his hands.. but when we charged into the room, he dropped it, and raised his hands up, backing up towards an open window.

Kay: "FREEZE! STATE POLICE! HANDS! SHOW ME YOUR GODDAMN HANDS!!" I had him sighted in.. come on, you bitch, give me a reason.

Tirek: "Ohhh.. YOU!!!!" He screamed, but kept his hands up.

Kay: "Mmm.. didn't expect to see me, did you?" I smirked, as the others covered him.

Tirek: "No. You're supposed to be dead." He looked at me, with angry regret.

Kay: "Sometimes.. things just don't go your way." I smirked. "Cover me." I stated, as I saftied and set the rifle down, out of his reach, so I could frisk him.

Tirek: "Mm. I see you met up with my pet." He glared at Sunset, who had the AR-180B. "You know you're ruined. It'll never be the same after what we did." He fixed her with a cruel smirk.

Sunset: "Your words can't hurt me." She defied him. "Besides, K was ten times better than you'll ever be." A cocked brow.

I moved over, spun him around, bent him over, and very, very roughly (and thoroughly) frisked him, turning out each pocket, feeling up each seam in reverse (to avoid any needles), roughly groping and squeezing his junk.

Point of fact, he IS hung. I had to give him that.

I placed each thing that I found, on the desk. Wallet, cell phone, keys, handercheif, folding knife (just a small one), and an odd coin.

Kay: "Tirek, you're under arrest. Charges are election interference, conspiracy to commit blackmail, and sexual contact with a minor under the age of 18." I spun him back around, and pulled out a card from my shirt pocket. "You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you so desire, but cannot afford one, an attorney will be provided to you at no charge before questioning. Do you understand your rights, as I've read them to you?"

Tirek: "Oh, indeed." He gestured a bit. "May I lower my arms, officer?"

Kay: "Special Deputy." I smirked. "I give you two weeks in prison before your cheeks get spread so wide, you can drive a.. herd of bulls.. through them."

Tirek: "Oh, that's just in BAD taste!" He snorted at me.

Kay: "Tirek.. Tirek.. Tirek.." I patted his cheek. "You.. made a huge mistake trying to fuck with me on my home turf." I stepped back. "This.. this is MY world! Or, close enough. If I hadn't beaten you with the law, I was on my way to beating you WITHOUT it!" I nodded to Gilda. "Given more prep time, and a few more guns, maybe a different approach, I could have taken all your gangs from you, and overthrown you from within." I chuckled a little.

Tirek: "I knew this was a fool's errand.." He growled. "..all it would take is you, coming here. I should never have done this."

Kay: "Then, why did you?" I tilted my head at him.

Tirek: "Simple. The reward outweighed the risk. Had you come only a short while later - a few months - then Colonel Blackheart would have been removed, the State Police would have been in CHAOS! And I would be primed to advance my pieces.. and checkmate that dear.. governor." He nearly said Princess.

Pinkie: "Aw, but, Tirek.. you forgot about me, until you didn't." She giggled. "If push came to shove.. I would have just killed you." She fixed him with a gaze. "K---- taught me the Magic of Violence on a much larger scale."

Kay: "Where's the artifacts?" I asked, plainly.

Tirek: "Mmm.. I feel like staying silent, no-"

I just shot him in the knee, with Grogar's S&W 469. He crumpled, yelling in pain, and holding his wound.

Kay: "The artifacts you stole." I slid my foot under his jaw. "You want to live long enough to see prison?"

Tirek: *GRSH!* "YES! FINE! BASEMENT! Room 4!" He winced in pain - I'd blown right through his kneecap.

Kay: "Thanks." I lifted him up - he was taller than me - and gently pushed him towards the window. "There's just.. one other thing, Tirek.." I darkly dripped into his ear.

Tirek: "What is it!?" He hissed back.

Kay: "Pinkie?" I nodded to her.

With a flick of her chaos power, that piece of gardening equipment known as a woodchipper, that was positioned right under his window, turned on.

Kay: "This is what we do to kiddie touchers in my world.." I fixed him with a cruel smirk..

..and shoved.
