-NEIGHTO Command Advisory Group

Officially constituted on War Day 875, the NEIGHTO CAG is a unification of the Equestrian Military General Staff under General K, and the various foreign units often assigned to work with him on a long term basis. This is a force of between 90 and 150 individuals, not including support units and personnel. As the "fightin'-est outfit in NEIGHTO," they are often at the center of any trouble, and may just as often lead from the front as the rear.


-Equestrian Army, Rangers

Equestrian Army Rangers were the first formation trained by General K in the use of arms. Organized around 6-pony squads initially, the job of a Ranger varies from pointed special operations missions of sabotage and destruction of enemy personnel and equipment, to silent infiltration or creative and unconventional assault of enemy positions at the spearhead of conventional forces.

Rangers are designed for both long and short duration missions, and while they may be trained for specialized independent insertion, they are just as well equipped for conventional firefights.


-Equestrian Navy, Naval Special Warfare (NAVSPECWAR)

Essentially, the Navy answer to Rangers. While Rangers can perform NAVSPECWAR's job, NAVSPECWAR can do it better. This unit specializes in littoral zone assualt (that is, assaults over the beach or up a river from an ocean or sea). Like Rangers, this can be a single-objective operation, or as the spearhead to a conventional invasion by Marines.

After a conventional invasion, NAVSPECWAR - like Rangers - can form a spearhead component to a Marine assault further inland, taking advantage of terrain and special tactics to disrupt enemy defenses, and make Marine conventional assaults easier.


-Equestrian Army, Airborne

Airborne are elite trained light infantry, specializing in parachute and glider assault. They can jump as pure infantry, or with mechanized and even artillery support. As a light infantry unit, they can be used to jump behind enemy lines and prepare or clear out and defend areas prior to a conventional attack over land, or a Marine assault from the sea. With full support, they can form the spearhead force for a purely aerial invasion, securing airstrips or even constructing them, to permit the arrival of conventional forces.


-Republic of Canida, Canidan Forces Ranger Regiment

While named a Regiment, the unit and both its direct suborninate Regional Militia Ranger and Ranger Fencibles untis, do the same basic jobs as the Equestrian Rangers, and in similar ways. The proper CF Ranger Regiment itself is a force-wide special operations team. Regional Militias - which act as a territorial army - also have regional Ranger units, which often have specialized training more fitting for their specific environment. The Ranger Fencibles are like Equestrian local militia units, and are not intended for anything but domestic defense.

All Canidan Ranger units are trained in mountain and cold weather operations. Havoc's Ranger Company (CFRR 1st Special Service Force) is directly assigned to the NEIGHTO CAG, and are cross trained in maritime operations. As with Equestrian Rangers, they can perform sustained combat operations as easily as short term ones.


-Crystal Kingdom, Aero Marines Pathfinders

The Crystal Kingdom Aero Marines perform the exact same functions as Equestrian Army Airborne, with the eliteness and esprit-de-corps of a Marine Force. The Pathfinders are their Ranger equivalent. As expected of an Airborne-centric force, the Pathfinders do not have specialized littoral zone training, instead having specialziation for covert aerial assault. Like Rangers, they can perform the function of an unconventional spearhead to a conventional attack.


-Kingdom of Prance, Prench Foreign Legion

The Foreign Legion is both Prance's most elite combat force, and where Prance sends those that wish to entirely reinvent who they are. Legionnaires are given the choice to change their names, and after seven years of service, may become Prench citizens.

Doctrinally, the Prench Foreign Legion are trained for airborne operations, and to perform the same functions as a Ranger unit. After the Quirtbeck Incident, Legion Companies were reorganized to perform three basic tasks: take ground, hold ground, and disrupt the enemy.


-Kingdom of Ambleon, Special Air Service Regiment

The SASR are as multi-functional as the Equestrian Rangers, but with different duties. They are not a spearhead force, they are purely for covert operations. They can insert by land or air, and are not intended for sustained operations. They also perform the function of an elite counter-special operations/counter-terror unit within the Kingdom, and as such, use weapons and tactics unseen in standard Ambelonian military forces.


-Kingdom of Germaneigh, Kommandos der Spezialkriegsführung (KSKF)

The KSKF are a fusion of Equestrian Rangers and Crystal Kingdom Pathfinders - their job is unconventional attacks on enemy facilities behind enemy lines, via special covert insertion. They can soften up an area in preparation for conventional attacks, but are not intended to be a spearhead force for conventional units. Every member of the KSKF are trained in sabotage and sapper duties, and can handle explosives.


-Principality of Vulpesylvania, Special Forces Squadrons

There are different SFS's for different jobs. The six-fox unit assigned to the NEIGHTO CAG, led by Seven Devils, are cross-trained in numerous specialties, and can perform just about any task needed of a special operations unit. All SFS's are designed around a six-fox "A-Team" and a twelve-fox "B-Team." The "A-Team" is intended to close with the enemy for whatever special mission the SFS is intended for, while the B-Team provides direct support or infiltration/exfiltration. The Command Team, a six-fox leadership, coordination, and intelligence unit, rounds out each Squadron.

1st SFS is assigned to the NEIGHTO Command Advisory Group.

2nd, 3rd, and 5th SFS are designed around "black side" ground special operations, such as assassination, intelligence gathering, and covert raids on fixed enemy positions and faciltiies.

4th and 6th SFS are deisgned around "green side" ground special operations, and have double the number of forces. They can be a spearhead or invasion preparation force, and are designed for prolonged operations in enemy territory.

7th and 9th SFS are naval "black side" special operations, like the 2nd/3rd/5th.

10th SFS are naval "green side" special operations, like the 4th and 6th.

11th SFS is a special warfare development and training unit. Its size expands and contracts as needs arise. It is not intended to deploy for combat operations.

12th SFS is a counter-terrorism unit of triple the normal size, that works alongside the National Police.
