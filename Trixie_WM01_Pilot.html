The life of Trixie Lulamoon hasn't ever been glamorous. She's tried so many things, so many times, that she's honestly forgotten all of the dead end side jobs she's tried to do. Everything from cashier to costume designer, it's blown up in her face.

Two things have remained constant, however, in the last 31 years. First, her best friend and ex-on-again-off-again boyfriend Dusk Seeker. Second, the inevitable typhoon she creates in his life, and has, since they were teenagers.

Now, however, Dusk was finally ready to settle down. His life was evolving. Change was coming. He was engaged to Rarity Belle, the fashion designer. Someone that came into their lives in High School, when she transferred to Ponyville High from Whinnysota. Dusk had long had an interest in her, and for her part, Rarity had accepted the.. arrangement.. dating.. and break-ups of Dusk and Trixie, as they tried to make things work.

It didn't help that Dusk's father didn't completely agree with his idea to join the Royal Guard, but.. it is what it is. They try to make the best of it.


December 17, 1011 C.S.
7:02AM Canterlot Royal Time

Dusk was exhausted. Three days of tactical training for the upcoming winter holiday events. With Griffon terrorists making waves in the news, the guard commanders thought it best to make sure all the Guard Teams had extra training on every possible alternative, to keep them sharp.

He got to the door of his apartment, and fished out his keys.. but he could hear.. his TV going?!

Oh, not this again.

He unlocked the door, and just trudged in, taking off his tactical gear as he did. He knew what was up as soon as he smelled his espresso machine (that Rarity got him) having been run.. and.. not immediately cleaned.

There she was, on the couch, in slightly faded pink pajama pants a size too large for her (again, as she's clearly lost weight), and a white tank top.

Trixie.

Dusk: "..Trixie, you can't keep doing this, I'm engaged, now." He shrugged, setting his tactical vest on the rack. "Look, Trixie-"

Trixie: "It's just a few days. I'm starting a new job, Dusk, come on.. please?" She gave him the pouty eyes, as she finished chewing the last of his Biscotti.

Dusk: "Ugh.." He slumped forwards a bit. "Alright, alright, you know where the couch is. And no more buying new series on Hayflix." He wagged his finger. "I may be getting a promotion, but I want the bonus to go towards the wedding."

Trixie: "YAY!" She jumped up and hugged him around the neck. "Trixie knew you would understand!"

The time they'd spent dating all those years ago, and going even further back, the time they'd spent growing up together had taught Dusk one thing: This wasn't going to be a few days, and he was going to have "Sex and the City of Canterlot" on his account.. again.

That and he'd have to stock up on snacks.

Dusk: "So, what's the job this time?" He asked, digging into the fridge for a Kirin beer.. and finding that she'd not gotten into those, yet.

Trixie: "Ah.." She smiled a bit. "..I'm getting a gig as a stage magician."

Dusk: "A stage magician..?" He cocked a brow at her. "Isn't that.. a bit.." He wanted to say 'beneath her' but, he knew, magic was one thing she was decent at.

Trixie: "Trixie does not care." She flipped her hair a bit. "Also, I stole your towels."

Dusk: "..I'll get the extras.." He cracked the beer open.

Trixie: "It's a real chance, Dusk." She stopped and looked down at her empty espresso cup. "Okay, the pay sucks, but.." She shrugged. "..it's something."

Dusk: "And what'll you be doing? Where's the stage?" He sipped the beer as he unzipped his coveralls.

Trixie: "Well, a-" She had to pause, seeing his.. well, impressive muscled frame.. and remind herself that she threw this away ages ago and was not entitled to so much as a fleeting thought. "-ctually, I'll be.. you know.. a birthday party and event magician." She had to blink a few times to keep herself from staring.

Dusk: "Oh." He shrugged, and chugged half the beer, to keep HIMSELF from staring, now, seeing her tank top dangle a bit too loosely from her frame, and reminding himself that he was, in fact, engaged. "Still, ah.." He shrugged. "..got a few gigs lined up?"

Trixie: "Mhm." She gave an almost cat-like saunter around a few steps. "The talent agency has me lined up for the Senators' Charity Dinner tomorrow evening."

Dusk: "Oh, good. I can keep an eye on you, then." He smirked.

They both stared at each other, blank-faced, knowing that what he just said had started far too many nights of regrets.. well, the regrets came in the morning, actually.. the nights were just sweaty.

Trixie: "Oh?" She shrugged. "Well, at least I'll be well protected.." She stopped, and blushed. "..we need to be.."

Dusk: "I'm taking a shower and sleeping." He stated firmly. "No joining me."

Trixie: "O-Of course." Not that she wasn't thinking about it.. again..

So, Dusk went and showered. It was a hot shower at first, but his mind started wandering disloyal. So, he shut the hot water off after he washed his hair and stood there. Reminding himself of the last time. And the time before that.

Really, almost every time.

The breakups had never been terribly bad, but they had been because of her, every time. She wanted things, he wanted things, they'd wanted each other, but in the end, Trixie was too much of a free spirit, and Dusk - despite the fallout with his father - wanted something more traditional.

In the end, Trixie never really grew up.

She still had fantasies of this and that. Desires. Wants. Needs. She wanted to be rich and famous, but be darned if she couldn't string things together well enough to even make a living. Every time, every loss, she came back to him.

He slid into his bed and rested himself. Stretched out. A big part of him felt guilt at his thoughts. His mind wanting that one thing he'd had that felt real - the time he'd spent with her, on and off. But.. now.. he had someone that would anchor his life.

Rarity.

When his thoughts went there, he smiled to himself. Unlike with Trixie, Rarity had been very strict about not frolicking before marriage. They were to be married in January. She had, though, made every effort to tease him and remind him what he was waiting for.

Sleep came. He knew he'd only get about six hours of it, as he promised to meet his lady love later on for a late lunch. Then, he had to report for duty before the Charity Dinner and go over plans, prepare equipment, and all that.


3:17PM

After waking, Dusk had gotten a clean uniform on, and managed to get out the door without waking a sleeping Trixie. A Trixie his 'other mind' had not been able to resist peeking at, given how her top had come up and exposed her.

A bit more guilt at that, but, he got down to the cafe without incident.

Dusk: "There's my girl." He walked up and hugged her.

This anchored him back a bit. The feeling of her more full, properly fed frame, and healthy.. uh.. everything. She was soft and perfectly fit, full.. whole. Pure.

Relief washed over him as she pecked his cheek and they got to their table.

Dusk: "Ahh... I got some news, Rares." He shrugged. "We.. ah.. well, you know I'm working tonight." He looked at the waters that the bus boy brought them, and immediately put a little lemon juice and sugar in his. "Trixie'll be there, too."

Rarity: "..oh?" Her annoyance was instant.

For her part, Rarity was.. accepting of the light blue menace, as she understood that her and Dusk had a long and hard history together. She'd seen some of it, been there for him when they broke up, and finally decided that since Dusk was moving up in the world, she needed to be there with him forever.

She loved him. Deeply. He made her happy. He made her feel special, feel like she was, indeed, a thing of beauty to be adored - not the daughter of a couple of farmers from Whinnysota. He completed her.

Dusk: "She's performing. Ah. Magician act." He shrugged. "You think she can get a ride with you?"

Rarity: "I suppose. Since I'll be attending and all." She nodded.

Dusk: "Can you.. pick her up at my place?" He blushed sheepishly.

Rarity's eye TWITCHED. OH NO! On Celestia's MANE that woman was NOT going to home wreck. NOT HER MAN. No, no, not like last time, five years ago, when they were first dating and she stole him away for a year, only to leave him. And hurt him.

Rarity: "AGAIN!? Dusk! We've been OVER this, Darling! You can't keep trying to help her!" She snorted, irritated. "She's beyond help, darling. She can't stand up on her own two feet if you keep propping her up." She flapped her arms.

Dusk: "I know, I know.. but.. I'm a Guard, too, you know." He sighed. "Remember the last time we tried that? The... the man she ended up with? What he did to her?" He grew morose.

Rarity: "..alright." She said quietly. "..I understand." She shrugged. "After all, it's hard to throw someone aside when you've known them all your life." She shook her head. "And she's not bad.. just.. bad at life."

Dusk: "Yeah." He shrugged. "Look, maybe she's finally..." He trailed off, as he looked at the menus, realizing what he was saying.

It was the same things he'd said a dozen times before. That maybe she's found her calling, that she'll be stable now, and so on. Really, neither of them had much faith in her ability to do anything, even survive on her own.

Rarity: "..we can hope, darling." She ended the entire back-and-forth with that.


5:22PM


Trixie was digging through the suit case she had, that was full of all kinds of different things. Mainly stuff for a magic act. She'd done stuff.. kinda like it before.. being assistant to another magician. So, she had the clothes for it.

She was chewing on a sandwich, as she came out with the fishnets and heels. And a bra and panties in black. They were still clean from the last time she'd washed them and never used them. She had, also, a singlet - also black - to go along with it. She liked this one, as it pushed up on her breasts.

She looked down at "her two traitors" that had never grown to the impressive size that she'd desired. They were just enough under a B-Cup to make B-Cups too big, and A-Cups too tight. She sighed, and got out the pads to go with it. With those, she could pull off the shadow of a B-Cup.

Now, she dressed. Carefully getting everything on. Looking at herself in the mirror. Adjusting, posing, and not at all feeling strange to be naked in Dusk's apartment. Never mind that she'd stolen pillows and blankets that smelled like him to sleep with.

She caught her own eyes in her reflection, and saw.. disappointment. She'd lost the one thing that was real to her, with her own foolish actions. Now, he was going to get married. They were still close friends, but... it wasn't the same.

She idly wondered to herself if.. that was the one thing she'd really wanted all this time. And her successive failures were a tantrum about not getting it. No matter. She would do.. SOMETHING with her life. She couldn't stand being a girlfail any more. She just.. and she hugged herself thinking about this.. didn't want to be alone any more.

The upcoming charity dinner this evening promised a decent payout. Her talent agency was paying by the gig to get around Equestria's tax laws, so, she got a bigger payout over all, but nothing went towards things like her retirement savings plan or things like that. Still, 1200 Bits was 1200 Bits.

All dressed up, and she even polished her high heels. She stood, sauntered a bit, to get a reminder of her rhythm, her spiel, her grace. She leaned over, to let her cleavage show, practicing her distractions. She went through each of her sleight-of-hand tricks, one at a time.

Unicorn magic helped. She could levitate things while her body acted as the ultimate distraction. A few stretches, and she was fully ready, making sure to put some antiperspirant in all the right places.

Rarity finally showed up.

Rarity: "Ah, Trixie, Darling!" She put on the 'fake happy.'

Trixie: "Hi, Rares!" She smiled and went in for a fake hug. "Yeah, cut the crap. You don't want me hanging around, do you?" She pulled back, and looked her in the eye.

Rarity: "Ahahah!" She fanned herself. "Whatever made you think that, darling?" She couldn't avoid a shakiness to her voice.

Trixie: "Come off it." She shrugged. "Trixie knows how much you love Dusk." She sauntered a bit. "And Trixie realizes you're an Alpha Bitch." She leaned forwards a bit at Rarity. "We know where we both stand." And shrugged, standing. "I'm.. really trying this time, Rarity." She grew quiet. "After.. -him- I.." She held herself.

Her last boyfriend, her only boyfriend after Dusk, had been horrible and abusive. His brother had helped cover his actions. When Trixie displeased them, she suffered. They were both horrible, but with Dusk's help, she'd managed to get away from them.

Rarity: "..you're really making an effort, this time?" Her tone was neutral.

Trixie: "Yes." She said, firmly. "I just.. need a little cover until I can.." She shrugged, waving her hand about. "..get on solid footing, is all."

Rarity: "Well, then.." She sighed. "..I shall do what I can to help. But, Trixie, this must be the last time. After we get married, it would not look proper for a rising Guard officer to be having the appearance of having an affair." She shrugged. "My business relies on reputation, too."

Trixie lowered her head and nodded.

Trixie: "..if this doesn't work out, can I at least get a gig as your gofer or something?" She said, humiliated.

Rarity: "Nothing would make me happier, Trixie, darling." She tried to be cheerful and encouraging with that, but there was venom...


7:15PM
Senators' Charity Dinner, Canterlot Royal Venue


Dusk was reporting in to Commander Armor. TACTEAM 6, his unit, would be 'back security' for the event..

Shining Armor: "If there's trouble, rush the room as planned, and get the senators and their families out. That's 6's job. Echo, your team provides cover." He tapped the dry erase board.

Echo: "Yes, sir." She nodded.

Dusk: "What about the other civilians?" He asked, with a shrug. "That going to be TAC 4?"

Shining Armor: "TAC TEAM 4 got reassigned to the palace." He shrugged, frowning. "We've had some intelligence drop on us in the last few hours that someone might try something there tonight."

Astral Sky: "So, what about the civilians, Commander?" She frowned.

Shining Armor: "Ehh.." He frowned. "..they're kinda on their own. Echo, if you can, give them some cover so they can get themselves out or to safety until the police get here. Expected response time for Canterlot SWAT is twelve to seventeen minutes. After we get the Senators out, the remaining civilians are their responsibility." He looked at his tac team leaders, and sighed. "I don't like it any more than you do."

Dusk: "And will Her Majesty be here, or no?" He nodded - whether Princess Luna would arrive was up to her, and she'd not made it certain before that morning.

Shining Armor: "She will." He nodded. "Her two personal body guards are responsible for her directly. Echo, if they need it, you'll have to give them cover fire, too."

Echo: "Kinda spreading TAC 5 thin, boss." She shrugged. "I'll grab an extra LMG."

Shining Armor: "Do that - and stun grenades." He shook his head.

Really, this was all Dusk's burden. As Trixie dealt with her life, he dealt with the complexities of being a Royal Nightwatch Guard in a world on the brink of... something. No one was sure what, but world tension was at an all time high. The Guards themselves had been given more duties over the years, and not a great increase in either numbers or funding. So, Commander Shining Armor had worked VERY hard to make sure they had as much SKILL as possible to back up whatever deficiencies their numbers or equipment might leave.

Dusk's billet as Tac Team 6 Leader was secondary to his rising rank. He was soon to be promoted to Altern - equal to an Army Captain - and 6th in the chain of command below the Nightwatch Commander, Wispy Shadows. He'd been singled out for his adeptness at leadership, understanding of tactics, and unique flexibility and adaptability under duress. Becoming an officer had been a hurdle, too. But, he was on his way. His rise through the ranks meant better pay, and eventually, a staff position.

The pressure, though, had been immense. It didn't help that the times he was with Trixie, or helping her, he'd missed some key training or missions or something. Not that the guard had ever fired a shot in anger... really, since the Collectivist Uprising over 100 years ago, and still, no one had been killed.

Things were changing, though.

Dusk checked his SMG for the tenth time, pulling the magazine out, tapping it a bit, and putting it back in. A nervous gesture.

Shining Armor: "Alright. Everyone get to your positions - the event starts in 30 minutes." He nodded.

And so, he'd take his team, and move out.


7:22PM
Backstage

Trixie was finishing setting up her miscellaneous items and magical trick objects. About then, a tall stallion approached her with a smile. His coat was pale, hair two-tone, and he had a small soul patch. He was wearing a black turtleneck and slacks, making him look well dressed.

Stallion: "You're Trixie, right?" He asked, casually.

Trixie: "Oh.." She got into character. "Yes, I am the Great and Powerful Trixie!" She bowed slightly. "No autographs until after the show, handsome."

Stallion: "Ah-hahah.. yeah.. listen, I'm with one of the Senators' staff. He's a big fan of magic shows, you know? But he always complains they never use enough flash powder." He pulled out a fat sack of bits, and put them on one of her trunks. "600 bits, he'd like you to double the flash powder." He smiled a bit.

That.. that was equal to half the pay she was getting for this gig! She.. she needed that. She, however, was VERY quick to assume a confident pose.. to not betray her desperation.

Trixie: "Well met, handsome. The Great and Powerful Trixie will certainly be glad to take special requests for a payment like this." She picked up the sack and stuck it in her standing suitcase with her street clothes and alternate costume. "Hm.. I think.. the middle of the act when I do the teleportation trick?" She tilted her head. "I can do four flash pans and increase the amount. Should be a BIG flash!" She beamed a grin.

Stallion: "Oh! Perfect." He smiled and bowed. "I'll make sure the senator knows you were so obliging." And slid out.

With that, Trixie worked to get the last of her things ready, and dope her flash pans properly.


9:33PM
Grand Ballroom


Most of her act had been very well received. Much applause, and even a few cheers, as she pulled off several notoriously difficult illusions and display spells. The senators were eating this up, the rest of the audience was eating this up. Trixie was a success, so far, and the midpoint of her act was the "teleportation trick."

It was well known that teleportation magic was difficult to pull off, even by high level Unicorns. In fact, only Princess Luna and Celestia were able to do it easily, and perhaps a couple of others that had been born with the gift.

Trixie had not.

Moreover, teleporting someone ELSE was nigh impossible. Meaning, this was a VERY GOOD trick.

Trixie: "And for my next trick.. one that I assure you will absolutely knock your socks off.. I shall teleport an audience member from here.." She tapped the first locker-sized box. "..to here." She tapped the second box, at almost center stage.

There were ooh's and ahh's as this was explained.

Trixie: "Now!" She spotted Rarity in the Audience.. good, Rarity knew how the trick worked, and she knew she could trust her. "Miss Rarity! Would you care to assist The Great and Powerful Trixie?" She gestured to the stage.

Rarity: "I would be delighted!" Rarity had to admit that she'd been having a good time - and that Trixie WAS very talented at this.. she was starting to think that Trixie might just make this work! So, she moved up to the stage, in her slinky black formal dress. "Goodness, darling. How does this work?" She smiled, sweetly, not betraying that she knew everything and had, long ago, helped her practice this trick.

Trixie: "Simply step into the box here, fair lady." She swished and sashayed around Rarity in a flirtatious (to the audience) move, that Rarity leaned a bit into, as she guided her to the box.

Rarity got in, and Trixie shut and locked the door.

Trixie: "NOW! Ladies and Gentlecolts! Behold, and be amazed!" She stepped over to the cabinet she'd locked Rarity into, and tapped it. "With but a flick of my wand, and the foci of the Magic Words, I shall teleport this vision of loveliness from here.. to there!" She pointed at the other cabinet. "ABRA KADABRA! ALA KAZAM! POWER OF MAGIC, SEND!"

At that moment, as expected, her flash pans went off. As she'd rigged them, they went off with EVEN MORE flash and bang than normal. What she DIDN'T know was.. she basically Flash-Banged the ENTIRE ROOM by increasing the powder amount by as much as she had.. so it appeared.

The Magical Flash-Bang blinded several close-by audience members. Several were stunned outright. Among them was the members of Tac Team 2, positioned near the Senators.

That was all "they" needed.

At least twenty armed men rushed the room, several waitstaff pulled out guns, there was screaming, there was yelling, there was gunfire.. and Trixie fell back on the stage, blinded by her own trick.

Dusk: "TEAM SIX, GOGOGOGOOGOGOGO! FIRE! FIRE!"

Echo: "TEAM FIVE, COVER FI-"*ACGH*

Terrorist: "WE HAVE NEIGHSAY, PULL BACK!"

Princess Luna: "WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?!"

Bodyguard: "GET THE PRINCESS OUT! GET HER OUT!"

These voices could be picked out by Trixie - Luna's especially, as she shouted at full volume.

Rarity: "TRIXIE!" She got her hands under Trixie's arms. "COME ON!"

Trixie felt herself get pulled back stage. She still couldn't see very well.

Trixie: *Crying* "OH, CELESTIA, THIS IS ALL MY FAULT!"

Rarity: "Shut up!" She hauled her to her feet. "Hold still!" She used her own magic to help clear her eyes. "Can you see?!"

Trixie: "I-I can.." She shook off the stars. "Oh, Rarity!" She sobbed. "I'm so sorry!"

Stallion: "So am I." He approached from the side. "Thanks for the help, Trixie." He had a gun. "Without you, we never would've been able to kidnap Senator Neighsay." He smirked.

Trixie: *Venomously* "YOU! YOU PAID ME!" She hissed.

Rarity: "He did?!" She looked at her, confused.

Stallion: "Yep." He smirked. "The flash pans worked just as planned." He shrugged. "Gotta get rid of loose ends, though, ladies. Sorry. Nothing personal."

He was about to shoot them, Trixie rather foolishly pressing her body to Rarity's in front of her, shielding her, when one of the other attackers arrived.

Terrorist: "NEON! TAKE THEM! WE NEED EXTRA HOSTAGES!" He ordered.

"Neon": "We were SUPPOSED to just KILL her!" He hissed.

Rarity, thinking quickly, slid out of her high heels and disengaged one of her earrings, dropping it into her right shoe as she did.

Rarity: "Fine. We'll come along." She volunteered immediately.

Trixie: "Rarity..?" She looked at her, almost mewling.

"Neon": "Hurry up." He demanded, as he manhandled Trixie, and stuck the barrel of the pistol to Rarity's head. "Move it!"

They were led outside, and stuffed in a van with several of the Terrorists, and Senator Neighsay. The Terrorists bound their hands and ankles. Rarity was scared, alright, but she refused to show it. She would not break her image as a Society Lady. Trixie? Mewled and complained, but complied. They also had Magic Blockers placed on their horns.

Trixie: "Rarity, I'm so sorry! Everything I touch just turns to SHIT!" She sobbed.

Rarity: "There, there, Trixie, darling. Everything will be alright." She reassured her. "Don't worry about it, alright? The magic act was positively SPLENDID-"

"Neon": "Will you two SHUT UP!?" He leaned back and waved the pistol in their faces.

Rarity: *Tersely* "She is HAVING a MOMENT.. DARLING." She hissed. "One, that I must point out, is ENITRELY your fault." She cocked a sassy brow.

Terrorist #2: "That bitch got some sass, Neon!" He chuckled deeply. "Don't scream, okay?" He leaned back and shoved Neon aside. "Go on. Get girly-friend." He smirked under his balaclava. "Just watch your mouths."


10:14PM
Grand Ballroom

Shining Armor: "...this is FUCKING DISASTER!" He paced in.

The Canterlot Fire Department and Police were there, the crime scene investigation unit was placing tape and markers, and.. the coroners were bringing out the bodies.

He stopped one of the stretchers, and pulled the sheet aside. There lay Echo, a gunshot wound in her throat and another in her upper chest, just above her body armor.

Shining Armor: "I WANT EACH OF YOU TO LOOK AT HER!" He pointed.

Dusk: "Sir.." He shrugged, looking at Echo.

Astral Sky: "Commander, we-"

Shining Armor: "You absolutely failed tonight." He growled. "All of you." He pointed at the remaining Nightwatch Guards. "Seven Guards killed, ten civilians, including Senator Mores and one of Luna's bodyguards. AND FOR WHAT?" He furiously waved his arm. "You got four terrorists. You managed to get half the senators evacuated, but you caused a STAMPEDE!" He yelled. "If this isn't one of the most incompetent-"

Dusk: "INCOMPETENT?!" He stood up, glaring at Shining.

Shining Armor: "You better watch your mouth, soldier." He pointed at him. "It's not any of their former girlfriends implicated in HELPING them." He stepped right up to Dusk. "Or maybe you helped, too?"

Astral Sky: "COMMANDER!" She stepped between them. "That is ABSOLUTELY out of line! We KNOW Dusk, we TRUST him."

Shining Armor: "You.." *Pfft* He dismissively threw up his hands. "I'm standing down the Nightwatch. Permanently. You can ALL go BACK to your little ceremonial uniforms and strut in parades." He shook his head. "You're not real soldiers. None of you. If this is the result? You should all be ashamed."

Wispy Shadows: "COMMANDER!" She stood up, and moved right over to him. "YOU CAN'T!"

Shining Armor: "You're relieved of duty." He pointed at her. "Pending Courts Martial. For incompetence and dereliction of duty."

Wispy Shadows: "...I'll fight that." She narrowed her eyes.

Shining Armor: "Go ahead. Even if you win your Courts Martial, you're done as commander of this... unit." He spat verbal venom at her.

Dusk: "What about Senator Neighsay and the other two hostages? Sir." He cleared his throat and brought attention back to the matter at hand.

Shining Armor: "TWO hostages. And one traitor." He glared at him. "That'll be up to Canterlot P-D and SWAT." He shrugged. "That's not the Guard's job. A Guard's job was.. SUPPOSED.. to be to protect." He snorted. "You're all dismissed. And you're all off duty until I can finish the paperwork t-"

Dusk: "That's not acceptable. Sir." He cocked a brow. "Canterlot P-D and SWAT aren't trained in Counter-Terrorism. We were. Are."

Shining Armor: "I wouldn't trust you and your so-called watch to counter an illegal lemonade stand." He snarled. "You're stood-down. All of you hand in your weapons and equipment and go home."

Dusk: "No." He shrugged. "I'm.. going to go rescue my fiance and my friend." He flapped his arms to the side. "And the Senator, too."

Shining Armor: "Y-You're going to disobey a direct order?" He stomped back over to him. "YOU'RE GOING TO DISOBEY A DIRECT ORDER FROM ME?!"

Dusk: "I recognize that you've issued me an order. Given that it's a stupid-ass order, I've decided to ignore it, yes." He shrugged again, and chuckled. "Hey, Mist, gimmie your spares. I'll need the ammo." He held his hand out for Evening Mist to hand over her spare SMG magazines.

Shining Armor: "Oh, no. I'M PLACING YOU UNDER ARREST!" He went to grab him, but Wispy stood in his way.

Wispy Shadows: "You want him? You go through me." She glared at him.

Shining Armor: "Fine." He pointed to Dusk. "Arrest that man!"

Astral Sky: "You stood us down. Sir." She glared at him. "We haven't the authority any more."

Hoisted on his own petard, Shining Armor sputtered. The other Nightwatch Guards folded their arms behind them (those that could), and simply surrounded him, refusing to lay hands on him, and knowing if he tried to lay hands on THEM, that HE'D be the one in trouble.

Wispy Shadows: "You better be right, Dusk. And you BETTER come back with all three of them." She turned her head. "Now, hurry. Go!"


12:03AM
Unknown Warehouse, City of Newhorse


The hostages were led into a small room and forced to sit down by the terrorists. Trixie had done a lot of crying, but she was calmer, now. Rarity was stoic, as ever. Senator Neighsay was still covered by his black hood.

Terrorist #3: "Just stay put. No funny business." He wagged a finger at them. "We're arranging guest quarters." He chuckled a bit and departed.

Rarity sighed a little in relief. Given that they were still bound, in the dark and dank little warehouse room with a single illuminating light bulb that hadn't been changed since 955 C.S., she didn't see a whole lot of options, but she scooted over to the Senator and nudged him a little.

Rarity: "Senator? Are you alright?" She asked, in a soft tone.

He muttered through a gag, but he didn't sound in distress.

Rarity: "My name's Rarity, and this is Trixie." She spoke reassuringly. "Fear not. My fiancee is in the Nightwatch. They'll be along presently to help."

He muttered something through the gag that didn't sound confident.. but sounded like he was trying to reassure them.

Trixie: "So, what do we do?" She shrugged as much as she could.

Rarity: "Simple. We observe. Everything. And keep calm. Do as they instruct." And she leaned in to Trixie. "And just in case, Darling, I'm going to slip one of your earrings off as a bread crumb."

Deft teeth slid over Trixie's ear, and her tongue and lips freed her star earring from its hole, and she spat it on the ground near her.

Trixie: "..not the first girl.." She muttered.

Rarity: "What was that, darling?" She smirked.

Trixie: "I said, you're not the first girl that's sucked my ear lobe like that." She said in hushed tones.

They both giggled. The Senator made noises that sounded like mild annoyance, but he quieted down.

After a short while, two Terrorists came back in.

Terrorist #4: "Alright. Come along." He moved into the room with a knife drawn. "Kick me and I'll cut that pretty face of yours." He said to both of them.

He used the knife to cut the ropes at their ankles. They were then lifted to their feet and walked to another part of the warehouse, where a small table, and a camera were waiting.

Rarity: "Oh, my! You should let us do our makeup, darlings, if we're going to be on camera." She smirked at them.

"Neon": "Oh, shut uuuup!" He made a frustrated reel-back of his hand, but stopped and shook his head.

The Senator's hood was pulled off, and his gag was removed. He was seated at the table. Rarity and Trixie were sat on either side of him. A paper was placed before him, and his hands were untied.

"Neon": "You know the drill, Senator." He shrugged. "Read the statement for the Camera when we tell you to."

Senator Neighsay: "RIDICULOUS!" He spat at them. "As an Equestrian Senator, I REFUSE to cooperate with TERRORISTS!"

"Neon": "Senator, if you refuse to READ the statement, we'll kill a hostage - one of these lovely ladies - right on camera. And you'll be responsible." He shrugged. "As they say - the pain is in the process. Read the statement, or be responsible for an innocent person's death." He smirked a bit. "Should ruin your re-election chances, hm? And your shot at being President of the Senate next term."

Senator Neighsay: "Erugh.. you have a point." He picked up the paper, and examined it. "Now, who do you represent, again?" He looked at them.

"Neon": "Don't worry about that. Just read the message." He tapped the paper.

One of the other Terrorists came in at that point, and smirked.

"Neon": "What is it?" He frowned.

Terrorist #5: "They think she's in on it." He pointed to Trixie. "Untie her, but keep her under control."

"Neon": "OH HO?! Excellent.." He smirked. "You heard 'em."

One of the other terrorists in the room did just that, but when they moved to pose, he kept his weapon casually aimed at the back of Rarity's head.

Terrorist #6: "One false move, your girlfriend becomes a Jackson Paddock painting." He leaned in to say that.

"Neon": "Alright. Ready?" He got behind the camera.

Terrorist #6: "Hit it." He nodded.

"Neon": "And.. action." He pointed to the crew in front of the camera.

Terrorist #6: "Ponies of Equestria. Listen up and listen good. Your Senator has a message." He tapped Senator Neighsay.

Senator Neighsay: "I am Senator Neighsay. I have been asked to deliver this message." *Ahem* "Ponies of Equestria, we have been oppressed by the Royal Sisters for far too long. We call on the Equestrian Royal Government to abdicate and give power back to the Ponies. We demand our Comrades be released from prison immediately. We demand Equestria stay out of foreign affairs. Ponies of the World, Unite! Cast off your chains imposed by those that think themselves above you. You have nothing to lose but the cuffs that bind you. You have everything to gain - your pride and freedom. If our demands for prisoner release are not met within 48 hours, we will begin executing hostages." He put the paper down. "The message ends."

Terrorist #6: "48 hours."

"Neon": "...and, cut." He nodded. "Very well done." And a shrug. "Now, get the hostages to their proper cells."

The three of them were then led to another part of the warehouse. Seeing that they were passing a part near the front, Rarity dropped her tennis bracelet, and casually kicked it to the side. They arrived at a series of small closets. Each closet had a metal door, and a small window set into it, with bars. Senator Neighsay was placed in one alone. Trixie and Rarity were placed in another, together. The doors were sealed, and the Terrorists departed.

After a moment, Senator Neighsay spoke up.

Senator Neighsay: "These aren't terrorists." He frowned. "This is something else entirely."

Rarity: "Not that this isn't important, Senator, but.. how do you know?" She leaned on the bars, and tilted her head.

Senator Neighsay: "They didn't list names, and they didn't identify themselves." He shrugged. "The recording is a distraction, a ruse. I have no idea what they're planning, but they're trying to convince people they're Collectivists. They aren't." He snorted a bit.

Rarity: "I.. see. Hm." She shrugged. "Welp, we need to be ready to go when Dusk gets here."

Trixie: "He'll come." *Hic* "I know he will." She sighed.

Rarity: "Indeed."

She got her other earring off, and reached outside the cell, feeling for the lock on the outside. She plucked one of the metal pieces off of her necklace to use as a tension wrench, and casually probed the lock.

Trixie: "How does it look?" She asked quietly.

Rarity: "Old lock. This won't be hard to pick." She smirked.

Senator Neighsay: "Some society lady YOU are." He chuckled.

Rarity: "...mhm, and you wear a rug, so.." She didn't even look at him as she casually dropped her social counter-threat.


1:47AM
City of Coxsaddle


Dusk was on his own. Not totally, but mostly. He had the unstated support of the rest of the Nightwatch. Text messages between him an Astral confirmed that they were forcing Shining Armor to file suspension paperwork on each one of them, in addition to his stand-down order, which they demanded be signed by Princess Celestia - who wouldn't be able to get to it until noon, tomorrow, at the earliest.

He had ten hours to find them before his authority to arrest was taken away. Another four past that before Shining Armor probably would send the regular Royal Guard to arrest him for disobeying a direct order, and hold him for Courts Martial.

Fuck that prick.

The fingered the scar on his nose a bit, as he finally got his helmet off, and got his purple beret on. The car was parked, and he looked at the apartment building it was next to.

He needed help. Direction, someplace to go. He knew only one woman that could provide that kind of insight. Someone that was on a short leash, ever since the Equalinburg Incident five years ago.

He got out of the car, slinging his SMG behind him, and walked over to the apartment building. The foyer light was out, and a bum was snoozing next to the mail boxes. He checked the apartment number with his tactical light, nodded to himself, and ascended the stairs. The faint sound of a crying baby could be heard. It was, otherwise, very quiet.

Apartment 2-F.

He fished out his lock picks with Rarity's cutie mark on them, and just picked the cheap lock. He caressed the engraving a little.

Dusk: "Hang on, you two." He muttered to himself.. before slightly opening the door, then rearing back and kicking it.. he marched in, weapon raised. "STARLIGHT GLIMMER! NIGHTWATCH! MAKE YOURSELF KNOWN! RIGHT NOW!" After what she did in Equalinburg, he didn't trust her to not try and zap him with a spell, or something.

The apartment was precisely four rooms - front room, kitchen/dining, bedroom, and bathroom. He swept the front room, but didn't need to go any further. Her periwinkle coat rose up from the couch, and she stretched. She was topless. She was.. kinda stacked.. and she rubbed her face a bit, and looked at him.

Starlight Glimmer: "Oh, no, it's a G-Man." She said the slang for Guard with absolute boredom. She blinked twice, looked down, and shrugged. "Go ahead and look - the girls don't mind."

Dusk froze with his weapon aimed vaguely in her direction, and blinked. He found he WAS staring at her ta-tas. He cleared his throat, and lowered the SMG.

Dusk: "Subaltern Dusk Seeker, 6th Tac. I need to ask you some quest-"

Starlight Glimmer: "Yeah, yeah, about the attack tonight. It's all over CNN (Colt News Network)." She shrugged. "Sounds like you Nightwatch boys really stepped in it." She flung the blanket aside, revealing her nudity, and stretched again, standing up. "I fell asleep waiting." She moved into the kitchen, and chased away some Palmetto Bugs. "Coffee?" She hit the button on the coffee machine, which was pre-loaded.

Dusk stared at her nakedness.. and had to kinda look away a bit and clear his throat.

Starlight Glimmer: "You know, our ancestors practiced nudity all the time until about a thousand years ago." She paced over to him, and smirked, striking a smug pose, fist on hip. "You should try it some time - VERY liberating."

Dusk: "I came for information." He immediately regretted his phrasing. "..I'm engaged."

Starlight Glimmer: "Ah-huh." She shrugged, and went to the cupboards and searched around for a snack, coming out with a jar of Jif peanut butter and some bread, she made peanut butter sandwiches. Yes, nude.

Dusk: "My fiancee and my best friend are hostages." He stated, trying ever so hard to avoid looking at her.

Starlight Glimmer: "Oh, well, that changes things." She shrugged. "If this was just about Senator Neighsay, I would've..." She looked to the side. "..there's a lot to unpack here, and.." She shrugged. "..I know you don't have much time. The news said that Princess Celestia herself would be reviewing Shining Armor's stand-down order. That means you have maybe ten hours." She slid the plate over to him, turned, bent down, and fetched two coffee mugs.

Dusk was SERIOUSLY FIGHTING with his 'little guard' to stop.. please stop.. looking at this rather sexy woman with curves better than Rarity's, boobs better than Trixie's.

Dusk: "Then we should get started." He leaned back and shut the door, then physically went into a 'D'OH!' pose.. PHRASING!

Starlight Glimmer: Giggle "You're cute when you're flustered." She sat down after pouring coffee. "Point is, you need to eat, and all soldiers run on coffee." She slid the mug over. "Sit. I have a lot to explain."

He did as instructed, safetying his SMG, and pulling the sling off, to sit it across his lap.

Dusk: "You're right. I haven't eaten." He shrugged. "And coffee sounds good."

Starlight Glimmer: "You have no idea what happened with me five years ago." She just took this as fact. "The regular Royal Guard handled it. Probably heard the rumors - I was running a Collectivist Utopia town or someshit."

Dusk: "Yeah. Go on." He started eating the sandwiches, with coffee to lubricate the pasty peanut butter going down the gullet.

Starlight Glimmer: "Well, it's not really true. I used forbidden magic to remove everyone's cutie marks, and make them all equals. No skills, no talents, no one excelling above anyone else." She shrugged. "I did this using a magical artifact. That's why it's classified. Mind you, I was approached by a lot of other nasties that wanted the secret for far more nefarious reasons. Me? I just wanted a place where no one felt oppressed or lesser or smaller because they didn't have a good mark, or.. worse.. got bullied because they got a bad one." She gestured. "Came from my own feelings of being inferior and being rejected by other children all the time, as a kid." She shook her head. "At least according to my court mandated psychiatrist. Anyhow.. well.. after I got busted, I gave up the magical items and some information in exchange for my freedom. Problem is, other nasties kept thinking - still think - that I'm going to try again."

Dusk: "Are you?" He cocked a brow.

THAT'S when the tears came. TEARS! HIS ONE WEAKNESS! She almost instantly started sobbing.

Starlight Glimmer: "Why bother!?" She sniffed. "Everyone that came willingly was thrown in jail for a while, they hate me. I don't have any friends.. I.. I don't.. HAVE A FUTURE any more. My license to practice magic was revoked, I've been barred from most ANY form of employment I can get ahead on.." She waved her hands at the apartment itself. "I work a shit-ass dead end job at a gas station for THIS LOVELY MANSION.." She screwed up her face in pain. "And worst of all? The one man I ever loved, the one man I did all that for to impress him?" She cried harder. "The things he said to me at the trial.. and after.." Her head gently hit the table. "Everything I try, turns to SHIT.. mister Guard." She rubbed her face. "Not that you'd care."

Problem is, he did.

Dusk: "..maybe I do care, a bit.." He looked down at the coffee. "Everyone needs a friend." He looked over at her.

Starlight Glimmer: "Ch'really?" She snorted, incredulously.

Dusk: "Look, I'm not a hard-ass G-Man all the time, okay?" He shook his head. "I really do care about people and trying to protect them."

Starlight Glimmer: "..yeah, I think you do." She gave a ghost of a smile.. then snaked her hand across the table, and intertwined her fingers with his. For a brief second, Dusk felt a faint magical detection spell pass through him. "I was right." She blushed.

Dusk blushed.

Starlight: "Just call me Starlight." She said, softly. "You sure you're loyal?" She smirked a little. "I can see your problem."

Dusk: "Ah-er-y-your spell must be off." He blushed and pulled his hand back.

Starlight: "I didn't need a spell to see the tent you're pitching." She narrowed her eyes just slightly, in a seductive gaze. "I'm hot. I get it. I'm hot, but I fuck up everything I touch." She shrugged a little. "Wanna get fucked up? You can always tell your girl that was the price I exacted for her safety."

Dusk: "..it'd be a lie." He sat up straight. "You're still a good person. You wouldn't." He shrugged a tiny bit. "Plus, if I read you right, you wouldn't get any pleasure from forcing it. You want me to come willingly." He internally kicked himself. PHRASIIINNGG!

Starlight: "Okay, okay, you're right." She shrugged. "If you're not going to strip off that armor and jump in willingly, I'm not interested." She sighed.

Dusk: "So, can you help me, or not?" His tone was neutral.

Starlight: "One.. of the reasons I avoided jail was that the Royal Guard thought I could act as a lightning rod of sorts. You know, crazies come to me asking for advice or whatever, and I pass along the threats to whomever.." She shook her head, and stared towards her TV set. "..thing is, when I told them about the latest one, they didn't believe me." She shrugged. "Shining Armor just blew me off." She frowned.

Dusk: "DID he..?" He leaned in. "So, what's the threat? Assume I'll believe anything at this point."

Starlight: "Well...."


2:15AM
Unknown Warehouse, City of Newhorse


Rarity was silently moving along the hallway where the prisoner cells had been. Peeking into each one of them, she realized that they all had prisoners IN them. Which was strange. She didn't get it until she got to the last cell.

Rarity: *Excited harsh whinny* "Commander Armor!?"

Shining Armor: *Groan* "Who.. who goes there?" He said in a weak voice, his weakened body lifting his head off the ground as best as he could.

Rarity: "It's Rarity Belle - Dusk's fiancee! What are you doing in there?!" She said, trying to contain her shock.

Shining Armor: "Miss.. Belle.. it.. it was.." He struggled to speak.


2:17AM
City of Coxsaddle


Dusk: "CHANGELINGS?!" He spit out his coffee.

Starlight: "That's what I just said." She shrugged.

Dusk: "I mean, I've heard STORIES about them.. but.. I've never seen one." He shook his head.

Starlight: "The story goes that they infiltrate nations by kidnapping key government officials, impersonating them, and then crashing that nation to the ground. In the ensuing chaos of the approaching collapse, they feed, stealing people from their homes, off the streets, that sort of thing. When the people inevitably gather to revolt, or whatever, they flee. On to the next host to Parasite off of." She finished her coffee. "They leave collapsed governments in their wake. Devastation. Civil conflict. Ponies can't trust each other. Societies broken down, the social contract ruined. It's supposedly what happened to the nation of Tarpangoslavia about thirty years ago, that caused it to break up. Balkanize, they call it." She smirked a bit, and stood up. "I have a feeling it's about to happen here." She sighed. "You can't do this alone."

Dusk: "It's not like I have any backup." He frowned.

Starlight: "You do." She leaned forwards and pulled her bangs aside, showing her magic restrictor. "You have a key for this?"

Dusk: "I can trust you." He stated.

Starlight: "I don't want to get eaten. If I'm right, your boss is one of them already. He'll know I'm a threat. After tonight, he'll probably be after me soon. It's a good thing you came, you know? I was ready to high tail it for the hills." She smirked.

Dusk fished a special key from his tactical vest pocket, and pressed the tip to the small slot on the mithryl band. It opened. Magic Restrictors like that were part of his own detention kit. Of course he'd have a key.

Starlight: "There we go." She paced over to one of the drawers in her kitchen, opened it, and pulled out a semi-auto pistol. She et it on the counter, then pulled out two spare magazines, and a holster. "I need to go get dressed."

Dusk didn't bother mentioning how illegal it was for a convicted felon to have a heater. At this point, he was breaking a lot of laws himself. As she excused herself, he texted Astral Sky - he knew he could trust her. They needed more than just themselves...


2:21AM
Unknown Warehouse, City of Newhorse


Shining Armor: "..three weeks ago." He finished explaining how he'd gotten there.

Rarity: "So, you got kidnapped." She frowned. "That explains a lot. Your replacement has been positively AWFUL, darling." She sighed. "But, don't worry, Dusk is coming."

Shining Armor: "Yeah. And.. he'll be.. walking into a trap." He sighed a bit. "I'm pretty sure they.. they replaced several of us already." He grunted. "Only reason.. I'm still alive.. their queen.. likes me." He said those last two words with dark venom.

Rarity: "..goodness, darling." She whispered. "I'm.." She understood what he meant. "We'll get you out. I promise." She gave him a smile. "Just relax, okay? Won't be long now." She glanced back up the hall. "Gotta go. Have courage, darling!"

She scooted back to her cell, and shut it.

Trixie: "So, what's it like out there?" She asked plainly.

Rarity: "We're in a LOT of trouble, darling." She frowned.

"Neon": "Ah, I see you two're getting along nicely." He smirked.

Rarity: "Oh, indeed, darling." She stood up and paced over to the cell door window. "So, are you one of those changeling freaks, or just a traitor?" She smirked, struck a pose, and pulled out an Emory board, polishing her nails.

"Neon": "Figured it out, eh?" He focused his magic on himself, and a green energy flashed over him. His coat changed to black chitin, wings appeared, and a twisted horn appeared on his head. "Neon was a greedy guy. Shame he didn't live long enough to enjoy the bits he wanted." He glared at Trixie. "Just like you. You ponies are so easy.. you're greedy, you're easy to fool." He shook his head. "Once our Queen arrives, the fun begins."

Senator Neighsay: "YOU!" He was at the bars of his own cell. "You disgusting beast. Forty eight hours? Is that the deadline?"

"Neon": "Yep." He chuckled. "That message was for our sleeper cells. In two days, your princesses will be food for our queen. Your government will fall. There will be total chaos." He turned to face the Senator. "And then.. we feed freely. After all, once we cripple your country, who can stand against us?" He chuckled again, darkly. "This will be the birth of the Changeling Empire. No more will we be forced to live in the shadows." He wagged a finger at the Senator. "Now, we will have land of our own. And eventually, the whole world."

Senator Neighsay: "And just how do you plan to do that? Even if Equestria collapses, there is still Europe.. Neighpon..." He gestured.

"Neon": "All vulnerable to Daybreakers." He laughed. "Your own ICBM's will be used to bring the DAWN of the NEW WORLD!" He laughed, pointing at the Senator.. and then, focusing his magic, he turned into him.

Fake Senator: "See? Once I make my miraculous escape, I'll simply use my authority to have the ICBM's readied. A simple task once the collapse begins - I'll propose the worst possible thing, the most desperate of actions - use them on Equestria's own cities." He shrugged, and poked the real Senator's nose. "To contain the Changeling Hordes. Only thing is, they'll be targeted at the capitals of Europe and Asia instead. Why bother taking down one government at a time, when we can take them all?" He laughed again, and changed back into Neon.

Trixie: "Diabolical!" She hissed.

"Neon": "Yep. And we owe it all to you - your flash pans. We doped them. Your increased flash powder meant no one noticed the extra we put in there to turn them into flash-bangs." He shrugged. "Now that we have Senator Neighsay, and Senator Mores is dead.. our plan is nearly complete. By next week, the whole world will be in chaos." He shrugged, and bowed a bit to Trixie. "Thank you. For that, I'll eat you last." And departed, laughing to himself.

Senator Neighsay: "..I think we're doomed." He lowered his head. "And I think it's partly my fault. My insistence on a robust defense against the Herdiet Union.. my push to increase defense spending.." He shook his head. "What folly. I wanted to keep ponies safe. And here I am, the instrument of their destruction."

Trixie: "..and I'm the greedy bitch that made it possible.." She sank to her butt in the cell, and started softly crying again.

Rarity: "Oh, darling." She slid next to her and gave her a one-arm hug. "You needed the money that badly..?"

Trixie: "He offered 600 bits. I was promised twice that for just the show. 600 tax free? Are you kidding? I could get my car fixed with that! And the poor girl can have a full tank for the first time in ages!" She cuddled next to Rarity. "I.. I just wanted to do something RIGHT for a change! NOW I'M THE HUGE FAILURE THAT JUST DOOMED THE WHOLE WORLD! I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN!" She sobbed.

Rarity just hugged her, tightly, and looked up towards the singular light bulb.

Rarity: "Dusk.. please.. where ever you are.." She sniffled, too. "We need you."


2:33AM
City of Coxsaddle


Starlight was dressed, now. Practical clothes. Tan cargo pants, black tanktop, white blouse. She tucked her hair into a tan patrol cap. She had a drop leg holster for her handgun. She also had a pump shotgun in her closet - stockless, stainless steel, with black pistol grip and fore grip. Spare shells went in cargo pockets, spare mags for her pistol went into pouches on her thigh. She was.. strangely well prepared for this.

Dusk was admiring this. A practical, well stacked woman that knew her way around special operations? Yeah, this was.. this was scratching an itch in his brain that he hadn't realized was there.

Starlight: "I'm ready to go." She shrugged.

Dusk: "The question is.. where?" He shrugged back.

Starlight: "I know a few people that'll do anything for bits." She pursed her lips. "We start by asking them. Not nicely."

Dusk: "Alright." He shrugged.

They got into his car - it was unmarked, but it was a Nightwatch car, so, it had the full pursuit package. They drove from Coxsaddle to Plowkeepsie.. a straight shot. Along the way..

Starlight: "..now that I have a captive audience.." She shrugged. "I've always had.. problems. I was a late bloomer, and the colt I had a crush on was an early bloomer. He got his mark pretty young." She smiled, wistfully. "But then he left me behind." She frowned. "He was the only friend I had at the time. Really, I.. didn't make any others.. I was the only late bloomer around, and once they all got their marks, I was left in the dust. Ignored." She shook her head. "So, I decided the best way to make sure everyone was friends was if everyone was the same. No special talents, nothing." She shook her head. "Like it was before The Enlightenment." She said, referring to the mythical story of how Ponies first got their cutie marks in antiquity.. tens of thousands of years ago.

Dusk: "Pretty radical thinking." He said, as he drove. "But, I can understand, I guess. We're social creatures. We need.. someone. Anyone." He shook his head.

Starlight: "Yeah.." She sighed. "..even in school, I was alone. I ate by myself, studied by myself.." She blinked a bit, looking at herself in the wing mirror of the car. "..tried to join clubs, but I was rejected.. they remembered me as a late bloomer, and called me a failure, or slow, or whatever." She lowered her head a bit. "I just wanted friends, G-Man."

Dusk: "Just call me Dusk." He shrugged. "How'd you find the thing that took people's marks away?"

Starlight: "I.. it's hard to recall.. but.. this guy gave it to me. I can't really describe him. He had two different hands, and two horns that weren't the same." She shook her head, shrugging.

Dusk: "Oh, HIM." He chuckled. "Oh, yeah, Mister Mystery. Code name Chaos. We don't know his proper name, but he's been implicated in lots of strange happenings over the years."

Starlight: "Either way." She shrugged. "Oh, take the next exit."

Dusk: "Gotcha. Where are we headed?" He looked over to her.

Starlight: "You'll see. Old friend." She smirked.


4:37AM
City of Plowkeepsie


They drove up to another slum area. This was specifically a Griffon Slum. Only Griffons here. Even at this early hour, there were Griffon nestmakers fluffing about on the streets. Seeing a Nightwatch car pull up - even unmarked - they kinda cleared the streets.

Starlight got out, and proceeded to walk without fear towards one of the smaller houses. Dusk followed. While she left her shotgun in the car, he kept his SMG slung, but behind him, so his hands were free. Starlight went right to the front door, and didn't bother knocking, she just went inside. Dusk followed.

Starlight: "GILDA! WAKE UP!" She shouted, upon entering. A tall Griffon tried to get in her way, rising from the couch, but she intimidated him by summoning mana into her horn. "Back off, bitch. I'm BACK in ACTION.. and this time.. it's legal." She nodded back to Dusk.

A smallish female griffon came out from he back bedroom, with a rifle in her hands. Seeing that it was Starlight, she lowered it.

Gilda: "What the fuck, Glimz?" She cocked a brow. "You have any idea what time it is?"

Starlight: "No time, Gilda." She shrugged. "Listen, you hear anything about some strange dudes? They'll need a base of some kind - it's about the attack last night. There were a lot of them." She gestured.

Dusk, meanwhile, put a hand on the male griffon, and gently encouraged him to sit back on the couch, as he kept watch on the room.

Gilda: "Actually.. yeah..." She blinked a few times. "Strangest shit, too. They needed a stash house, but they weren't looking for the normal kind. So, someone told them about the old warehouse in Newhorse." She shrugged slowly. "They were really odd, but they paid in cash." She nodded. "They came to me for guns. I sold them a couple crates of Herdiet rifles." She looked at Dusk. "Gonna bust me, G-Man?"

Dusk: "I would, but Senator Neighsay and two others are hostages." He shook his head. "Just clear out before I come back. You got a day, maybe two."

Gilda: "Alright. Fair." She nodded. "The warehouse is the same one you used to move materials to that town of yours. You know it?" She addressed Starlight.

Starlight: "I know it." She nodded.

Dusk: "Alright. Come on." He gestured.

Starlight: "Thanks, Gilda." She shrugged. "You.."

Gilda: "I was the only friend you had, I know." She frowned a bit. "Outcasts gotta stick together."

Once they were outside and getting back to the car, Starlight explained.

Starlight: "When I was first detained, I met her in jail. We were bunked together. Survived together. I spent six weeks in that hole with her. She's... more like an ally. I call her a friend, but.." She frowned. "..she's not someone you invite over for Hearthswarming Eve."

Dusk: "Better than nothing." He nodded. "Let's get to the warehouse." He paused to text Astral Sky... time to set the trap.


5:33AM
Outside the Warehouse, City of Newhorse


Dusk pulled up along side the warehouse, out of sight, behind some lumber. The whole compound was a series of warehouses and former ice houses turned INTO warehouses. Their target was a modern metal sided one.

Dusk: "Can I get to the roof from the outside?" He asked Starlight.

Starlight: "Yeah, there's a ladder over there." She pointed to the corner. "You got a plan?"

Dusk: "Most of one. Astral is coming, but she'll be here in about half an hour. I'd like to scout the area first." He shook his head. "Once Astral gets here, I'll figure out a proper assault plan."

Starlight: "Alright." She nodded. "What do you want me to do?"

Dusk: "Here's a spare radio. Take it." He handed her a walkie-talkie. "If something comes up.. I think your only alternative is to come in blasting like a boss bitch." He smirked. "You know - get offended that someone's taken over your warehouse, demand answers, things like that."

Starlight: "Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!" She got a devilish grin. "I like the way you think, G-Man." She rubbed her chin a moment.

Dusk went to exit the vehicle, but Starlight leaned over and kissed him.. on the lips. Dusk had to stop himself. It was.. a very good kiss.. oh, my..

Starlight: "For luck. Don't get killed G-Man." She gave him a look that was a mix between seduction and appreciation. "You're the only real friend I've got." She nodded.

Dusk: "Ah-er-yes." He cleared his throat. "Friends. Yeah.. yeah." He smiled and nodded.

With that, he exited the car and made his way to the ladder. Time to get tactical. He attached the screw-on suppressor to his SMG. It wouldn't make it perfectly quiet, but it'd be much quieter, and with the ambient noise outside, it'd mask the gunshot pretty well. Up the ladder.. time to see what he can see..

He made his way across the roof, to the far side of the warehouse. The skylight here opened into a series of cells. He could see down into several of them.. as expected, he saw the Senator. At an angle, he could see Rarity's white coat. Scanning up and down the window, he spotted.. SHINING ARMOR!? OH SHIT.

Dusk: "When she said Changelings.." He shook his head, muttering to himself.

After scanning the cells and taking some notes, he moved to the next skylight. Here, he could see the so-called Terrorists milling about. Some were going over plans.. some were checking weapons. As promised, there were two open crates of Herdiet assault rifles, with folding stocks. The same kinds used in the attack on the Senators' Charity Dinner.

Dusk: "Well, that confirms that." He shrugged, taking more notes.

Observations made, and a sketch of the warehouse, he was about to get to the ladder. Astral should be here, soon, too. As he got there, Astral was flapping her way up. She landed next to him.

Dusk: "Astral." He nodded. "I have a sketch of the place. They have Shining - the Shining that fired us is a Changeling!" He gestured back to the skylight above the cells.

Astral Sky: "Oh?" She shrugged, hefting her LMG. "Seems he was right." She gave him a slightly sympathetic look.

Dusk: "..how long." She had him dead to rights. 'She.'

Astral Sky: "A week." She nodded. "She put up a real fight." She smirked. "Hands."

Dusk stood, raising his hands, letting his weapon go slack.

Dusk: "How many others?" He frowned.

Astral Sky: "Quite a few." She took his SMG off his shoulder, and slung it on hers, then relieved him of his sidearm. "Shining said you'd rebel once this happened.. and any others from the Nightwatch we hadn't gotten, could be pulled in." She shook her head. "You ponies are so gullible."

Dusk: "Yeah." He shrugged. "I guess we're just too trusting." He lowered his head. "You gonna do me right here?"

Astral Sky: "Nah. We have to get you to your replacement so they can copy you properly." She smirked harder. "Down the ladder. Go on."

Dusk did as instructed. One he got to the bottom of the ladder, he raised his hands again, and let her lead him. She didn't get too far.

A shotgun blast took her head almost clean off her shoulders. Dusk turned, and saw the splattered bug shift out of Astral's form and fall to the ground. Starlight stood there, shotgun smoking.

Starlight: "Guaranteed they heard that." She frowned. "Come on. You'll have to play along."

Dusk: "I hope you have a plan, now. Mine's shot to shit." He frowned.

Starlight: "I do." She had him turn around, grabbed the weapons from the ground, slung them, and marched him to the front of the warehouse.

Dusk trusted her. After all, he had no other choice. He didn't know that the literal fate of the world was resting on their shoulders.

Around front, Starlight marched him right inside.

Starlight: "WHAT BASIC BITCHES TOOK OVER MY WAREHOUSE?!" She screamed. "AND WHICH OF THOSE IDIOTS LED THE G'S HERE?!"

"Neon": "Ah..AH!" He trotted out, and bowed slightly to Starlight. "You're Starlight Glimmer, yeah?"

Starlight: "Fuck yes I am - who the fuck are you?" She glared at him.

"Neon": "Call me Neon." He shrugged. "Listen, someone like you could be real valuable to us." He nodded. "What'cha got there?"

Starlight: "Call him a bargaining chip. I shot another G outside. Looked like they were casing the place for an assault." She frowned.

Terrorist #6: "ANOTHER one?" He ran outside, then ran back in. "You dumb bitch - that was one of OURS!"

Starlight: "Like I'm supposed to know?" She hissed at him.

"Neon": "Faggetabout it." He waved a hand. "We can make another copy of them, anyway. Which one was it?"

Terrorist #6: "Astral Sky." He frowned. "She blew their damn head off."

"Neon": "Oh, psh. Yeah, just get someone over to her cell and make a copy of her. We'll need her. This one, too. The others should be on their way with the rest of the Nightwatch." He smirked. "Once we replace them all, OUR Shining Armor is going to put them right next to Luna. And that'll put us in reach of Celestia." He chuckled a bit, but got serious. "Starlight. You had a thing that could take cutie marks.."

Starlight: "Forget that - I know the spell." She shrugged. "What're you needing?"

"Neon": "How big an area can you cast it?" He was direct.

Starlight: "Pretty wide. Line of sight not necessary if I can spot them before they hide." She dismissively sniffed. "What'm I getting?"

"Neon": "That'll be up to our Queen." He shrugged a bit. "We're Changelings, babe."

Starlight: "Oh-ho!" She gave a devilish grin. "Sounds.. expensive."

"Neon": "I mean, I can guarantee some kind of a position in our Empire once we start it up, if you help us. More help, bigger position. Whadda ya say?" He extended his hand.

Starlight: "Good deal." She shoved Dusk forwards a bit, and shook hands with him..

As soon as their hands touched, she sent a lightning bolt down her arm, and into his body. Like the good bug he was, he almost instantly burst apart. She swung her shotgun over to the terrorist there with them, and fired a slug into his chest, sending him spiraling to the ground, dead.

Starlight: "HERE!" She hefted Dusk his SMG, and pistol. "Don't get killed! I'll draw them off!" She pointed.

They started taking inaccurate long distance fire from the far side of the warehouse.

Dusk: "You don't die on me either." He stated firmly, grabbing his SMG out of the air, and pistol from the ground. He holstered his sidearm, and took off, flipping the sling over his shoulder as he did, and raising the weapon, moving with weapon aimed.

Dusk moved along the side of the warehouse. Spotting a moving terrorist/changeling, he just fired. No hesitation. Just like last night. That'd been his first time using lethal force. Now knowing that these were 'just bugs,' made it easier on him. A burst, and down they went. He still had the suppressor attached, so, the fight with Starlight was overwhelming his own shooting.

On the ground, he spotted a tennis bracelet - Rarity's. He knew which way to go, now. Just as her shoes and earring told him, last night, that she'd been taken.

He got to the cells, finally, and swept around the corner carefully, slicing the pie, and firing at another changeling terrorist, putting it down.

Dusk: "RARITY!? TRIXIE?! SENATOR!?" Order of importance.

Rarity: "IN HERE, DARLING!" She called out.

Senator Neighsay: "Over here, Guard!" He stuck his hand out.

Dusk fetched the keys off the dead Changeling, and moved to Rarity's cell, only to find she'd opened it. So, he turned to the Senator.

Dusk: "Subaltern Dusk Seeker, Nightwatch, 6th Tactical Team." He opened the cell.

Senator Neighsay: "Bridlesbit Neighsay, and very grateful." He shook hands with Dusk briefly.

Dusk: "We have to get as many other prisoners out as possible." He nodded. "Rarity, take the keys. Where's Shining Armor?"

She pointed to the far cell, which Dusk immediately went to.

Dusk: "SIR!" He called in to him.

Shining Armor: "Erghh.. D-Dusk.." He struggled to get up, but he was very weak.

Dusk: "Stay there, sir. We'll get you out." He called in to him. "Relax - help's on the way."

He got his phone out, and simply.. dialed 9-1-1.

Dispatcher: P> "9-1-1, what's the nature of your emergency?"

Dusk: P> "This is Subaltern Dusk Seeker of the Nightwatch. I need SWAT and every available unit to the Warehouse, 2117 Waterfront Avenue. Senator Neighsay is here along with a LOT of hostages! Changelings are all over the place. I need everything you've got, and I need it now!"

Dispatcher: P> "W-We have reports of shots fired in that area, Guard. Is that your unit?"

Dusk: P> "I'm here with the Senator and several civilians. My team isn't here. Just get me everything you have. This is a matter of national security."

Dispatcher: P> "Understood! We'll start rolling units your way."

He hung up, and then called the palace. He knew the private number to Luna's quarters. Normally, one of her bodyguards would address the phone.

Princess Luna: P> "Who is this?" She was direct.

Dusk: P> "Subaltern Dusk Seeker, Your Royal Highness. Please listen - you and your sister are in immediate lethal danger. Several members of the Nightwatch and Royal Guards have been replaced with Changelings! Including Shining Armor!" He got into Shining's cell as Rarity unlocked it. "Tell her."

Shining Armor: P> "Y-your highness....." He groaned. "...changelings replaced me... s-send help. But.. check them.. first. Please. Be safe.. your majesty."

Princess Luna: P> "MY STARS!" She yelled. "It will be done. Attend your mission, worry not - the Moon shall guard the palace." She said with angered determination.

Dusk: "Alright, that's that." He pulled his pistol out and shoved it in Rarity's hands. "This is why I took you to the gun range for dates."

Rarity: "Oh-ho? Well, a Lady has to be deadly in social situations. I suppose this applies." She took it, and one of his spare magazines. She didn't really have a way to secure the spare mag, so she stuck it in her bra.

Some of the other prisoners were able to walk out of their cells. Some. Not all. Astral Sky - the real one - was one of them.

Astral Sky: "D-Dusk.." She grunted.

He moved over to her, and helped her up.

Dusk: "Astral. How are you doing?" He lifted her chin - she was pale and a bit thin, but otherwise seemed okay.

Astral Sky: "G-Give me a gun." She grunted.

He handed her one of the Changeling's Herdiet Assault Rifles. She ran the bolt back enough to make sure it was chambered, unfolded the stock, and staggered to the body, to grab a spare couple mags.

Dusk: "Alright. Astral? There's a ladder back there that leads to the roof." He pointed. "Get up there with as many hostages as you can - I'm going back for Glimmer."

Rarity: "And just who is that??" She asked, a bit excited.

Dusk: "She helped me find you-"

Rarity & Trixie: "SHE!?"

Astral Sky: "Oh, my." She laughed hard. "Dusk, you absolute chad." She smirked, and staggered to the other walking hostages. "Come on, everypony. We gotta go. Senator, stay between me and miss Rarity."

With that, Dusk turned and moved out. He could hear sirens, now. Lots of them. The city police were on the way. That would seal the terrorist changelings' fates. He just needed to save Glimmer.

Running back to where she was, he found her just as she ran out of shotgun shells and discarded her shotgun. He hefted the fake Astral's LMG, and brought it over to her.

Dusk: "We can go now!" He handed it to her. "Cops are coming, hostages are being rescued. We can pull out."

Starlight: "Yeah? Tell that to them!" She pointed.

The rest of the Changeling Terrorists were firing on them, in their well covered position, behind some heavy machinery. She set up the bipod, and fired a few bursts.

Dusk: "Yeah.. right." He nodded, and picked one of them off with a burst from his own weapon - he then rapidly reloaded, practically throwing the empty mag as he flicked it out of the magwell, before slamming a new one in, and slapping the bolt on top. He then grabbed his radio and turned it to the police frequency. C> "This is Subaltern Dusk Seeker to responding police - we're pinned down just inside the front entrance. Enemy has automatic weapons. Use caution, but we need support!"

Sgt. Copper Top: C> "This is Sergeant Copper Top, Newhorse P-D. SWAT will be here in ten minutes!"

Dusk: C> "Understood, but we don't have ten minutes. Some of the hostages are bad off and need medical attention right now!"

Sgt. Copper Top: C> "Alright. Give us a minute. Watch your rear!"

Dusk: C> "Understood!"

He went back to firing at the bad guys. It's almost scary how fast you can go through a magazine, firing at roughly where they are, just to keep them from firing back. After about two minutes, the front door was pulled off its hinges, and half a dozen officers with shotguns came in, made sure they weren't accidentally engaging Dusk and Starlight, and started firing on the terrorists.

Behind them came the rest of the officers present. Copper Top had a grenade launcher, and used it to fire a flash-bang shell right in the middle of the terrorist group, allowing the responding patrol officers to get in close, and finish them all off.

It was over. Dusk slumped into Starlight.

Dusk: "Nice work for an ex-villainess." He smirked.

Starlight: "You're not too bad yourself.. for a G-Man." She gave him a half-hug.


December 19, 1011 C.S.
7:02AM Canterlot Royal Time

Dusk finally got home. After their rescue and the combat action in the warehouse, he'd spent several hours explaining everything to the local police, then to the Royal Guard unit that Luna sent. Then he was brought back to the palace, where he was debriefed by both princesses.

All the hostages were rescued, and the worse off ones were all brought to a hospital in time. Shining Armor was the worst off, but he would recover.

After the excitement of the last 48 hours, Dusk just wanted to crawl into bed with his fiancee, and get some sleep.

Instead, he was greeted by Trixie, wearing still her fishnet stockings, her black bra and panties.. and HIS SHIRT. Her makeup was smeared, too, making her look like a total mess.

Trixie: *Yawning* "Ahh.. the Great and Powerful Trixie wanted to surprise you, dear." She shrugged. "But, I fell asleep."

Dusk: "I have a feeling.. this is only the beginning." He chuckled to himself, and went for the fridge.
