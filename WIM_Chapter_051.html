Part 1: Red Negotiation

TIME: 21:55 ERST
DATE: War Day 500/29 Octavius 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Illegal Border Post, between Kiangese People's Republic and Equestria

I watched as burdensome A7V-style tanks lumbered over the hills, accompanied by clearly stolen copies of the Herdiet GAZ-like jeep, and 1910's style six wheel trucks carrying troops.

Coco: "Estimate battalion strength minus a company, sir." She looked through the ("borrowed") Kiangese bincoulars.

K: "That company is watching us right now. Just you wait - an officer or NCO or few will break off and take a leak, but they'll really be talking to the observation posts." I nodded, and adjusted my coat. "Come on, let's get this over with."

I stepped out with her, and Sombra joined me.

Sombra: "In the event they start shooting, I will whisk us away in a dark cloud." He looked to Coconut Cream. "Be ready, but be still when you feel it."

Coco: "Understood, sir." She nodded.

One GAZ drove up closer to us than the others. I watched as troops deployed from the trucks. A quick glance behind, and I saw anti-tank teams from the Aero Marines zero in on the tanks. I turned back, and a pudgy-looking 'comrade' stepped forwards. He had more red stripes on his uniform than the others, but like the others, it was a plain tan with no decoration.

Decoration is a sign of decadent capitalism, or something.

Comrade Kang: "I am Comrade Battalion First-among-Equals Kang." He stated firmly.

K: "General-Field Marshal K---- K---, Commander in Chief of the Combined Armed Forces of Equestria, and Supreme Allied Commander of the NIEGHTO Alliance." I introduced myself.

Sombra: "Lord High General Sombra Blackheart, Retainer to the Princess of the Crystal Empire and commander of Her combined armed forces."

Coco: "Staff Sergeant Coconut Cream, 1st Airborne Infantry Brigade, Equestria Royal Army."

K: "My interpreter." I nodded to her.

Comrade Kang: "Such lengthy, decadent titles.." He gave me that 'Smug Chinese Shame' voice.

K: "Well, we like know who our leaders are." I shrugged. "Now, let's get to the point, Comrade." I nodded to him.

Comrade Kang: "Indeed. The point is simple. Remove yourself from our territory immediately, and we will not pursue."

I blinked, but gave him an even, unemotional gaze.

K: "You are in violation of the Kiangese-Equestria Treaty of 967 C.S., and in violation of the 1002 C.S. Peace Accords. Remove this border outpost, confess to your invasion of Equestrian territory, retun any and all kidnapped Equestrian civilians, APOLOGIZE for your invasion, take your POW's and corpses back, then leave." I returned the demands. "If you do not do so immediately, I am in possession of a Herdiet atomic warhead and have constructed several more. I will begin by erasing your cities. When I'm done genociding the majority of your population, the rest shall be liberated by our decadent capitalist society.. forever." I crossed my arms. "But, before that, Comrade, I outnumber you two to one and have armed Crystal Kingdom airships, and the mightiest Dark Magic Alicorn to ever exist. Your men won't die first, Comrade. YOU will." I pointed at him. "Moreover, when it's done, I will ensure your leaders know WHY they will feel Almighty Celelstia's BURNING cleansing upon themselves and your cities before I do it."

The rest of what I said was idle threats. I knew he wouldn't immediately recognize them as anything but bluster. The PERSONAL threat to SHAME him was the real negotiating tool, here.. SHAME him for ALL generations to come? That's worse than killing him outight.

Comrade Kang: "Ah-ah.. I.. see, General. You have to understand, I do not have authority to negotiate such things, I only command this small detachment for rapid response.." He gestured. "..I would have to confer with other Firsts-among-Equals.." He shrugged.

K: "Acceptable." I nodded, as any other response would have meant we started shooting. "Please be sure to introduce them to me personally when they arrive." I narrowed my eyes. "So I know who to tell future generations about, when they ask why their cities glow at night."

A threat to SPREAD the blame, thus, made him less to blame. I was giving him a HUGE chance to hang several of his Comrades in the Public Relations gallows next to him, thus giving him a HUGE out.

Comrade Kang: "I will confer immediately! But it may take some time for them to arrive-"

K: "I have already communicated with your central government, they will take no more than two days.." With the 'or else' unsaid.

Comrade Kang: "I see..! Well.. we shall make camp, then." He turned to leave.

K: "Indeed. You stay on that side, I stay on this side." I nodded to Coco. "Hand over the Border Guards, and bring me the Comrade Platoon Leader." I looked at Kang. "A show of good faith, Comrade. I want to avoid war as well.. and we both want what is fair to our people."

Coco and a few other Airborne brought them forwards and put them in front of me. I picked them up, and gently pushed them to the other side of the border, where their comrades came forwards and grabbed them. I heard Kang speak Kiangese.

Comrade Kang: "Thank you for this gesture, General." He nodded. "We shall stay to our side of the line."

K: "Indeed." I nodded back, and stood at attention. "Comrade Kang, you are a wise man over these regrettable incidents. I shall await your officials. You may signal by flag, bugle, or whistle if you wish to confer in person over any matters."

In a show of generosity, I motioned for us to withdraw first. After a few minutes, we were behind friendly lines.

K: "First, Sombra, how much fuel have we got?" I looked at him.

Sombra: "We had full loads when we departed to reinforce you." He nodded. "Should be.. 7/8ths of our fuel capcaity. Enough for over a week if careful."

K: "Keep the Superb and Swiftsure in the air at minimal power." I gestured. "Let the XY's float anchored, except 3101 - send it back for Celestia herself, and get the Royal Army units out here." I looked to Coco. "What did he say?"

Coco: "He informed the Platoon Leader that he would be questioned."

K: "I hoped he'd say that." I smirked. "I want him scared of a fate worse than death. If they're as superstitious as the Chinese are, the soul-sucking thing should terrify him more than an Atom Bomb."

Twilight: "Is this what you called Nuclear Brinksmanship, K?" She padded up with my team.

K: "Not really. I have no intention of flattening Kiangese cities - we only have the one warhead at the moment, the centrifuge hasn't been finished yet, and finding uranium has been a slow process. I could make another two bombs in 60 days if I had to. But, as I said, I had no intention of doing that." I looked at Sombra. "I have a much more terrifying threat."

Sombra: "'Tis good that my dark reputation be used for peace." He nodded. "I mind not that my former terrors be pilloried if it means saving lives." He shook his head.

Twilight: "So... now what?" She looked at me.

K: "Hey Fluttershy, what's for dinner?" I found a spot of ground, and promptly reclined on it.

So, my place had been set. We would await the arrival of Kiangese government officials. I knew Kang would call for reinforcements. He knew I'd call for my own. We were playing a dangerous game, but I already had the advantage. Question was, would I beat him?

Part 2: Red Redemption

TIME: 07:32 ERST
DATE: War Day 502/1 Noneus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Illegal Border Outpost, Neutral Territory

Celestia arrived yesterday, and most of the time had been spent preparing fighting positions at the very edge of the forest that was to our rear. There was no chance they'd get anything through here. The 1st and 2nd Royal Army Regiments arrived last night, with six Infantry Companies, two Cavalry Companies, two Artillery Batteries, and Derpy's Rangers. The artillery was dug in, with one Battery acting as anti-tank guns, and the other acting as true Artillery. Joining the force was the bulk of the Erie Captial Region Militia (which covered Canterlot, Ponyville, Manehattan and so forth), three full Regiments.

In addition, I had a company of Royal Guards as infantry, Sacquet's Legionnaires, another Prench Infantry company that had accompanied Princess Escargot, and an Ambelion Cavalry Company (2nd Company, Royal Horse Guards Regiment). Both princesses had instructed the company commanders that I was in charge, here.

Combine this with the 1st Airborne Regiment, which was 6 companies of Light Infantry, and the 1st Aero Marines Regiment, which was a mix of Light and Heavy infantry, and I had over 2500 ponies dug into the forest, plus two Wings of air support from Fighter Command, the Air Cruisers, and the Excursion Vessels.

Opposing me was 1800 Kiangese. If Kang had called for reinforcements, I couldn't see them - and we had clear vision for 12 kilometers behind his positions.

Finally, we saw a small convoy of early 1900s style cars approach, with Kiangese on-the-hoof escorting them. The government officials were here.

K: "Finish up breakfast and put these fires out." I instructed. "Come on." I nodded to Celestia, who was just finishing her little ceremony (which, itself, was a religious experience for my troops and a boost to their morale).

Celestia: "Mm.. I'm eager to see what they have to say." She murred a bit.

Sombra: "As am I." He nodded.

We walked over to the pillbox nearest the border area. As I instructed, there was a 20-meter dead zone between our entrenchments and their border outpost building. When the cars got over to their hasily-erected tent headquarters, I could see Kang stumbling over himself to greet them.

They didn't take long, and they seemed rather upset.

Coco: "I'm ready." She nodded.

K: "Here they come. Heh.. look at Kang, they're making him walk behind him. He's been shamed." I nodded. "This is good, it means they're willing to talk. Probably throw him under the bus.."

I paced forwards as they did. They were all wearing "Mao Suits" with no neckties, and standard "Mao Hats." Save one. He wore a Western-style suit. I pegged him as the most important.

We met right by the border building.

K: "Greetings, Kang. I trust the morning fares you well?" This was a polite tone, not a mocking one.

Comrade Kang: "Y-Yes, General! This.. this is Chairman Lo." He practically bowed to the man in the suit.

K: "Chairman!" I nodded respectfully to him. "Allow me to introduce Princess Celestia." I gestured to her.

Celestia: "Chairman. An honor." She nodded a bit.

Chairman Lo: "Ah, indeed, Princess." He gave her a formal nod. "General K?"

K: "Yes, Chairman." I returned my attention to him.

Chairman Lo: "I am told you have atomic devices." He got right to the point.

K: "I have worse." I nodded to Sombra.

Chairman Lo: "Dis incident is most regrettable. Kang's superior, Comrade Division Chairman Keng Wan is to blame. Without our authorization, he ordered his men to cross the border illegally, and loot your relics."

K: "I want everything that's ours, returned, Chairman." I nodded. "In return, we will give you what's yours." I started in.

Chairman Lo: "Indeed." He nodded slightly. "We have everything with us."

K: "I think Comrade Wan deserves public condemnation." Push the blame on to him.. even though I know Lo ordered it.

Chairman Lo: "I agree completely." He looked back at their escorts, and indeed, one of them was bound up. He shouted at them in Kiangese.

In short order, an older Stallion was brought forwards.

Keng Wan: "I am Keng Wan. It was I who ordered the attack on Equestria." He looked at the Chairman. "I apologise."

K: "Well, none of our troops were killed." I shrugged. "His were almost eradicated, and not in a flattering manner. I believe Comrade Wan was remiss in the training of his troops, and sent rank amateurs. Equestria has learned much over the last year and a half, Chairman - our troops are all veteraned." I looked at Wan, but flashed him a note of sympathy, knowing he'd die to protect his masters.

Chairman Lo: "I believe you requested the removal of this outpost.." He was getting to the point quickly.

K: "I did." I nodded. "I don't care, and in fact encourge, our Kiangese partners in peace to erect border control stations along their own border, or perhaps a few kilometers into the Neutral Zone as terrain dictates.. for security, of course." I nodded.

Chairman Lo: "Indeed! Security against bandits and outcast Griffon warbands.."

That's right, deflect the blame, you little weasel.

K: "Other than that.. the exchange of what is each ours, and the removal of this outpost, and the true criminal brought to justice.. I think we're good, here. I believe we've reached an amicable agreement." I extended my hand. "Your hoof on it, Chairman?"

He hesitantly shook hoof-and-hand with me.

K: "You can inform the others of your Triad.." OH, I GOT HIM THERE! "..that I see you as a wise, competent leader who cares about the fates of The People. Many of them might've suffered here, today, without your wisdom and fair leadership."

For those of you who don't understand, Chinese Communist leadership isn't actually absolute. Two former Chairmen along with the current Chairman form a special Triad. The former Chairmen being elders, they command the respect of the ones immediately below the current Chairman. If the current Chairman acts disreputably, the elders have the ability to remove him. Kiangese leadership, being a mirror, I took a stab at it being the same way.

I was right, judging by Lo's shocked reaction.

K: "There are a very hardy peoples much like you in the human world. I know.. all about them." Was all I'd say on the matter.

Chairman Lo: "Well.. I think.. these negotiations are concluded." He almost bowed to me. "KANG! I see to you to handle the details." He looked right at him, nodded, and toddled off with the other high ranking officials, leaving Kang alone with Wen.

K: "You lucked out, Kang." I looked at Wen. "There's a chance you'll replace him." And back to Kang. "I'll have the POW's brought up immediately. The corpses have already been removed from the Airships. My soldiers will render them full honors and escort them to the building." And back to Wen. "What's to become of YOU, Comrade?"

Wen: "I have already been convicted of Traitorous Acts against The People's Revolution.."

K: "Execution. Cute." I looked at Kang. "This whole thing's getting swept under the rug.." I put a hand on his shoudler. "You're no coward, Kang.. I would have seriously regretted having to fight you."

Kang: "..thank you?" He seemed confused by this gesture.

K: "I consider it a waste to have to lose men over an argument between leaders.. a far more tragic one to waste leaders with the courage to lead their men properly." I nodded to him. "We've been watching you closely. I've seen you go over to some of the troops, talk to them personably, like a leader should. A true First Among Equals."

Kang: "I see!" He whinnied a bit. "We have heard of your reputation, General.." He looked at Sombra and Celestia. "But had it been either of them, I would likely have.. pressed my point a bit more.. assertively."

My reputation preceeded me, and actually PREVENTED a war.

K: "Well, then. Sombra, as second in command around here, I leave it to you to confer with Kang and trade what's rightfully each others."

Sombra: "Of course, General." He smirked.

K: "Come, Your Highness." I escorted Celestia away.

Celestia: "Your reputation prevented a lot of deaths today, K." She nodded sagely. "It seems, despite our reservations, I made the right choice in making you Equestria's General."

K: "Seems so." I shrugged one shoulder, and gestured for Celestia to join me in my dugout.

Twilight: "Well, we're still alive.." She glanced at me.

K: "Indeed we are. My reputation prevented a fight, here, today." I gestured to Celestia. "It's a good thing, too. Even without those soldiers behind us, Kang was no match."

Twilight: "Do you think he wanted a war?" She tilted her head to the side.

K: "Perhaps he wanted a fast, easily won war - he wanted to see a weak leader over on our side, or one he thought he could defeat. Instead, he got a human that knows him almost as well as he knows himself, because he's a carbon copy of something from my world." I motioned to the map table. "We already had an advantage in ground forces, but with the airships thrown in, he had a serious disadvantage. I think once he reported this to his superiors, the plug was pulled on this operation." I looked outside to see bodies being moved. "Sometimes, Twilight, you have to show the neighborhood bully that you're not only willing to fight but have the means to win, to get them to back down. We had counters to all of Kang's forces. We had expertly trained fighters. We had combat resources he did not." I looked back at her.

Twilight: "I think I understand. To face off against a hostile nation, you have to have a strong military, the will to use it if you have to, and a strong reputation for winning." She nodded thoughtfully.

K: "That or a reputation of making warfare so painful for the other guy, that you bleed them white - and they KNOW you'll bleed them white." I wagged a finger. "It's not just victores your military accomplishes, but how they handle unwinnable battles, too - do they have a reputation for causing disproportionate losses? Forcing Phyrric Victories on their opponents - that is, where a win is more costly to them than a loss?" I talked with my hands.

Twilight: "I see what you mean." She tapped her chin. "But, that sort of reputation kinda.. means your soldiers are willing to die.." She looked down.

K: "As well they should be. And you have to have the will to send them to their deaths. Oh, of course, you should always try to use superior strategy and tactics to win, but there are times when a win isn't realistically possible.. and you have to be willing to send soldiers to their deaths regardless. When delaying your enemy by forcing them to deal with a unit that will fight to the death, to forestall, blunt, or prevent a larger and more devastating attack." I accentuated this with my fist to my palm. "Obviously, you should never allow yourself to be drawn in to a Phyrric victory, and you should never have a military so weak that they can't win battles. But, there are times when the worst possible situations come together and you have no other choice other than total or more devastating defeat. Warfare is fluid, but you should try to make sure you have the most 'fluid' on your side as possible. Get me?" I tilted my head at her.

Twilight: "I think I do.." She sighed. "..why are we discussing this, again?" She looked confused for a moment.

K: "Because, Twilight, you and a rare few others have the capacity to possibly think like me in war, one day, and I need to know that you're all ready.. even to make the hardest choices. This is why I lead from the front - I want those risks to be MY risks, too. I don't want to become detached and start thinking of our Ponies as numbers in a book, and become careless with their precious lives." I put a hand on her shoulder.

Twilight: "And that isn't at all how it's done in your world, is it?" She put her fetlock on my arm.

K: "Not anymore. But, it used to be." I smirked.

So, I stopped a war before it started, strangling the infant of terror in its crib of lies and deceit. In return, we paid the Kiangese back for First Paradise Estates/Chowsin Ridge in spades, inflicting 100% casualties to 0 losses, versus a technical 100-100 double knockout (given that only a few could even WALK after that fight), and secured the release of a few kidnapped people, and some stolen relics of dubious usefulness. We made them Lose Face.. and walked away with nary a scratch.

Now, on to the Expedition.. and more answers.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: White Peace

TIME: 09:32 ERST
DATE: War Day 504/23 Octavius, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Paradise Estates, Equestria

Sgt. Kiwi Spritz: "K! Over here!" She was waving her forelegs at me furiously.

I? I was trying to navigate the terrain behind Paradise Estates, and reflecting on how much it had changed since I last saw it 10,000 years ago. Stumbling carefully down a small cliff, I got over to where she was.

K: "What'd you find, Kiwi?" I looked at Cosmic, who was standing with her.

Kiwi: "I.. well.. look!" She pointed, and for sure, I could see a giant letter M.

K: "I think.. you found part of the Nursery.

Indeed, the giant letter M was on what looked like a petrified wall of some kind. Perfectly preserved, but devoid of color. It stood, lonely, among the trees. The Nursery had been reclaimed by the Forest.

K: "Tragic.. it's gone." I shook my head. "See what you can dig up. There might be something buried aroud here." I shrugged.

Lt. Black Berry: "Shame." He came trotting up. "Sorry I missed the second dance, K." He nodded to me.

K: "Hey, it's fine. I needed Aero Marines and Airborne." I shrugged.

Lt. Black Berry: "Wonder if my kids'll get any more ancient toys?" He chuckled.

K: "Maybe, maybe, old friend." I patted him on the shoulder as we walked back to the Estate Building.

Lt. Black Berry: "So, are we looking for just anything, or something specific?" He tilted his head.

K: "We know where Coltonville should be. Roughly. We'll be heading there, next. My main objective, here, is to see if there's anything from before the Coltonville Civilization. So, 8 to 10 thousand years ago." I nodded. "There was a two thousand year gap between The First Civilization right here at Paradise Estates and Dream Castle, and the Republic of Harmony's high technology. Which is about right, actually.." I shrugged. "From a socio-technological evolutionary standpoint assuming no major conflict was driving technological development."

Lt. Black Berry: "Lost me on that last bit, sir. I was a store clerk before the war." He gave me a shrug.

K: "Basically, there's nothing that looks wierd about how Coltonville developed." I paced over to a crate of looted treasures. "Anyone gone through this one, yet?" I pointed at it.

Dr. Allcome: "No, K." He shrugged.

I started to root through it. Discarded furniture pieces, petrified wood, chunks of earth or sedentary stone with knicknacks and doodads encrusted in them.. and a piece of earth with a bronze placque embedded in it.

K: "NEED SOME HELP, HERE!"

Lt. Black Berry: "I gotcha, sir."

He and Dr. Allcome both helped me pull the 150kg slab out, dirt still attached.

Lt. Black Berry: "BRING A HOSE!"

We washed it off carefully.. and realized what it was...

K: "This plaque is placed here at a reconstruction of Paradise Estates as a memorial to our early ancestors... along with the reconsructions of Dream Castle, the Nursery, and other buildings, we hope the historical significance of our earliest ancestors be remembered... DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY FROM THEM!?"

Rarity: "Oh, HORSEFEATHERS!" She stomped the ground.

K: "This plaque placed here by the Historical Society of the Republic of Harmonia, this date, 7 October 1957." I shook my head. "The rest is a list of donors."

Twilight: "Oc..TOE..ber?" She looked at me.

K: "Middle of Decemus to the middle of Solarius." I shrugged. "Megan must've given them her calendars to make time passage make sense to her." I shook my head. "This WAS eight thousand years ago, Twilight. It's not surprising the calendars have changed. My own calendar didn't take its current shape until a couple hundred years before my birth, and it isn't even universal."

Dash: "So, this whole dig's a bust, then!?" She snorted. "And that MAP!?"

K: "No, wait.." I rolled back on the balls of my feet. "That map was from 1993.. that map.. designated THIS Paradise Estates! Like a Theme Park! It'd've been a major landmark to anyone that lived there! The map is legit!" I looked at the ruins. "THESE.. are just a tourist attraction. So's Dream Castle. I'm going to wager that the disaster bunker we found underneath was constructed by the Republic of Harmonia as a nuclear war shelter, or something, NOT by the Ancients. It makes sense. In my world, too, public buildings had disaster shelters inside them. If these tourist attractions were popular enough, they WOULD take those kinds of precautions. And to make it turn a profit, they'd probably style it like they thought the Ancients might and use it as a sort of back-up or special event display area.. and we'd be NONE the wiser." I shuffled in a catcher's stance to look at them. "We aren't digging up the Ancients, here. We're digging up the Republic of Harmonia."

Dr. Allcome: "I feel as though I'm an ant trying to make sense of a toy grain silo." He tilted his head at me.

K: "Yeah." I shook mine. "This is exactly what I was afraid of." I looked towards the reproduction nursery. "That your civilization shifted geographically more than we thought."

Twilight: "But.. Luna.. Nightmare Moon.." Her face was confusion.

K: "She wouldn't have known the difference, either, Twilight. Remember, they LOSE memories when they shed their forms." I pointed at her. "She may not have ever known, either - remember, they stayed out of everything until a thousand years ago. That's seven thousand years after this was built."

Dr. Whooves: "Mmmm... and your trip to the past?" He gave me a 'Professor has asked Question, Student - FIGURE IT OUT' look.

K: "I wouldn't know the difference, either, after ten thousand years or so." I looked right at him. "Put a diverted river next to it, add eight thousand years of erosion.. I'm no geologist. I wouldn't know the difference between a few thousand years of erosion or anything like that." I shrugged. "Even the toy I gave you, Black." I looked over. "Instead of Danny's, it may've been a reproduction of something he left behind that one of THEIR archaeologists found and turned into something sold at the Gift Shop." I shrugged, then wagged a finger. "And I didn't appear in the past in the exact same place I vanished from."

Dr. Whooves: "VERY good." He nodded. "Oncemore proving our interest in you."

Gilda: "So, what now?" She shrugged.

K: "We find Coltonville." I stood up. "AFTER we check every single thing the Kiangese dug up and tried to steal. I'm willing to bet they had an inkling that this was a fake - Somnambula probably didn't, and simply forgot where everything was. Remember, we know for a fact that Ancient Ponyville from the Empire of Harmony is way to the north of Crystalpolis. That was what I call Generation 3. And we know that one came AFTER Coltonville. We know for a fact that the Republic of Harmonia suffered a disaster of some kind about seven thousand or so years ago, the people moved, and the Empire of Harmony sprang up some time afterwards.. but, from what we saw of Sven and his people, they stagnated. Two thousand years before Celestia took power, a thousand years before The Winter Of Hard Feelings, is when they were around. It makes sense that a hyper-advanced civilization, thrown back into the stone age, forced to relocate, and probably suffering from internal strife, would take so long to reclaim even a piece of their former technological status. The show itself suggested a 20th century society, but 18th century technology, no war, no weapons, no crises except the ones the.." I looked at Cheerilee. "...your former selves experienced."

Cheerilee: "So.. what happened between Harmonia and The Empire?" She tilted her head.

K: "I have.. absolutely no idea. That's a nearly five thousand year gap in history. No one we know - that would remember - is that old. For all WE know, there was another civilization that sprang up and died. But, WHERE is the question." I shrugged.

Dr. Allcome: "We may never know." He shrugged.

Iris: "So, General, when shall we leave for Coltonville?"

K: "Not until we go through everything in these crates. I don't care how insignificant it looks, it could be important." I nodded sagely.


TIME: 17:47 ERST
DATE: War Day 507/26 Octavius 1003 C.S.

The next three days was doldrum - open crate, examine every item, wash off dirt or chip through stone.. we found roughly $145.56 in loose change from a range of years starting in 1958 and ending in 1999. We found broken toys by the cratefull. We found dedication plaques and fragile scraps of aged paper. We found a stone tablet that was placed there to commemorate the opening of the museum in 1987. Finally, we found a Time Capsule Marker late in the third day..

K: "OF ALL THE BULL SHIT!" I yelled.

Cheerilee: "What's the matter, K?" She stepped over.

K: "Look, here. Those Kiangese bastards MOVED it.." I held out the medallion to her - it was bronzed steel, about the size of a dinner plate.

Cheerilee: "HEY, EVERYONE!" She called and most everyone came over.

K: "This Time Capsule Marker is placed here by the Brighteye Electronics Corporation, this date, 26 June 1995, to be unearthed in 150 years. Contained herein are samples of our society and trends. For our children's children to look at in wonder and enjoyment." I shook my head. "WHERE THE FLYING BLUE FUCK DID THOSE GRAVEROBBERS TAKE IT FROM!?"

Twilight: "Easy, K." She put a hoof on my shoulder. "Let's think about it logically.." She looked at the others.

Chemical Splash: "It wouldn't be placed along a walking path. It would be within.. say.. 100 meters of the Estate Building.."

Cosmic: "Probably off to the side, somewhere.. but still in full view.."

Gaze: "Aye'n there's a notch at th' top, lookin' like it were torn outta somethin' recently.."

Lyra: "Aye! An' the back looks clean.."

Bon-Bon: "It looks like the back was set IN to a recess of some kind!"

Toola: "I don't think they would've torn the whole thing out.. Time Capsule markers are usually laid into stone.."

Chemical Splash: "Standard Grid Search, everyone!" SHE took charge. "Pegasi, up!" She pointed. "No more than seven or eight meters!"

Fluttershy: "Right! Come, I'll talk to the animals.. the rest of you! Grab a partner! This is a Treasure Hunt!"

K: "Fluttershy? Splash?" I cocked a brow at her.

Fluttershy: *Hm!* "You were angry.." She patted my shoulder and gave me a half-hug. "..but, I know what you'd order in a situation like this."

Chemical Splash: "She's right." She nodded.

K: "How did I get such good friends?" I blinked.

Applejack: "Mmm.. helps one'a'm's yer wife, honeybun." She kissed my cheek. "C'mon.. you'n me!" She DRAGGED me away.

After another hour of searching...

Dusty: C> "This is Dusty - I'm at the far south side of the Estate grounds. I've found a large rock that looks like it would fit the medallion perfectly!"

K: C> "This is K! Everyone converge! Bring the heavy equipment! Dusty, we're on our way."

AJ and I were the first ones there, and we found Dusty carefully examining the rock. Applejack came up behind her, and sorta.. slid over her a bit.

Applejack: "Jes' so yew know, y'all banged a married stallion.. means y'all owe me." She NIPPED HER EAR.

Dusty: *EEP!* "Y-Y-YES, MA'AM!" She went STIFF. "I-I.." And blushed. "I've never been with a mare before.."

Applejack: "Mmm.." She looked back at me. "..be a threesome, sweetheart." And she trotted over to me. "Y'all're in so much trouble." She nuzzled me.. in the hip.. JUST as people were starting to arrive.

It was official, Applejack was now a total country-fried sex freak.

K: "Good timing everyone.." I coughed to contain my erection. "..Dusty found the spot, alright. Looks like this was gated off at one time, judging by the impressions in the ground."

Dusty: *COUGH* "Um-yes.. there's more, though. This looks mechanical. I don't think the time capsule was buried so much as it was secured in a chamber. We need.." She started tracing her hoof over the medallion hole. "..the medallion, and some thinking."

Ambrosia: "Or prybars." She snorted, always being the practical one. "K?"

K: "We'll give the puzzle a shot before we brute force it." I nodded.

Twilight: "I've got the medallion." She grabbed it in her teeth and set it into the recess.

K: "Fits fine. Yeah, I'm pretty sure they pulled it from here." I nodded. "Now.. let's see.."

Katrina: "It almost looks.. like.." She looked back at me. "K, stick your thumb in this hole, here."

K: "My.. thumb? But, ponies.." I stopped, and did as she asked. I felt a switch. "No way." From my thumb, I rotated my hand around until I found a slot for all five fingers. "Noooo wayy..."

Dex: "No way, dude! This isn't happening, man!" He was watching in utter disbelief.

Scratch: "It's happening.. and I don't get why."

I slid the recess inwards.. and the whole rock opened up. It hissed audibly, and I could see the inner chamber was nitrogen-purged and gas sealed.. very high tech, even for 2012.

K: "No way. No." I shook my head.

Rarity: "There's a large capsule in here, alright." She looked to the stronger ones. "Give a lady a hoof?"

After a few minutes, we got it out. It had Bright Eyes' cute mark on it. A notebook and pen.

K: "She did this." I blinked. "Open it."

It was secured with a simple latch. Greedily, we popped it and opened the casing.

NICE HISS. It was VACUUM sealed!

Inside was all manner of lost arts and items. Almost no clothing, though. Some bracelets and mane combs, some magazines.. and a cache of video casettes.

Katrina: "K!" She shot a look at me.. and gently handed me a box.

'For The Human'

K: "Wh-wh-wh.." I stammered.. and I was choked up. "She couldn't've..!"

I very... VERY carefully untied the string. The brown paper carefully folded back. Inside.. was a ring box. I opened it.. and it revealed a set of keys, some of them high security keys. Beneath them was a printed note.

K: "To the human of legend. Come find me. Bright Eyes." I looked at them. "It has a damn address on it!" I held it up.

1427 W Highway 3
Coltonville, Ponyland, Republic of Harmonia 4024-231

K: "This is almost identical to how an address would be printed in my world. Number, street, city, state, nation, zip code." I looked at Derpy.

Derpy: "Yeah, some things never change, K." She shrugged. "We do it the same way."

Twilight: "That means ancient Ponyland was.. like a state. Like Coltifornia or Maresechusetts.." She blinked.

Katrina: "And the Republic of Harmonia was the nation.." She cut in.

Dash: "Am I missing something.. or did she REALLY expect that address to still be there in eight thousand years?!" She narrowed her eyes.

K: "That's just it, Dash, I don't think she did. I think.. if anything.. I was brought to the wrong time." I looked at them. "I.. should have been THERE instead!" I pointed at the paper. "Maybe I was supposed to be there to prevent THAT apocalypse..?" I shook my head.

Rarity: "Darling, don't ever think that." She put a hoof on my shoulder. "What's happened, has happened. Right now, we need to find her."

K: "This.. time capsule.. she.. it wasn't supposed to be opened until their year of 2145." I stood up and paced away. "The ONLY way she could survive that long.." I looked back at them. "..is if she froze herself!"

The only thing that came to mind, after all. If you can't do it with magic, do it with science. And Science was her thing.

As I was famous for saying.. Science will Fuck You. And it just fucked me.

Part 4: Grey-Blue Horizon

TIME: 11:32 ESRT
DATE: War Day 509/8 Noneus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Underway aboard HCMAS Superb, 32km from Coltonville, Northern Equestria


Air Ensign Bessel Fracture: "Commodore. Coming into visual range, now." He reported from the navigation station.

Air Ensign Youle Tide: "Still on course, Commodore. Speed is 27 knots."

Air Commander Jade Notch: "Weapons manned and ready, Commodore. Flight Deck is on alert."

The bridge was laid out.. actually, it kinda reminded me of something from Star Trek, but in an airship. The Flight Controller and Navigator stations were in front, side by side. The Tactical station was to the right of the Captain's chair. To the left was an Engineering station. Behind the Captain's chair was the Signals Station. While the Airships were set up for Wireless Communication (through pony morse code, of all things), and now had Equestrian radio sets attached, they also had flags and signal lights options.

Commodore Iris Emerald: "Wingers! Any sightings of hostiles?"

Wingers were those that stood outside the Bridge to the left and right, on 'wings', with powerful binoculars able to see up to 40km in good weather.

Air Petty Officer Casten Irons: "Negative, Commodore. Skies are cl-" He paused. "COMMODORE! Griffon Flight! Bearing 0-3-4 degrees! They're heading this way."

K: "Ohhh.. I bet that's Gorosbif.." I chuckled. "It'd fit."

Commodore Iris Emerald: "Sound General Quarters." She stood. "Machine gunners at the ready.. First Fighter Squadron prepare to take flight."

Air CDR Jade Notch: "Aye, Commodore!" She shouted into a sound-powered telephone. "Beat General Quarters! Machine Guns, to the ready! First Fighters, prepare to take off!"

APO Casten Irons: "..more trouble, Commodore!" He spoke this loud and clear. "COMMODORE!"

Commodore Iris Emerald: "What is it, Petty?!?"

APO Casten Irons: "Commodore! It's.. it's the Dreadnaught!" He pointed.

Sure enough, a MUCH larger Airship came up from behind one of the hills. The Griffons were a screening force!

Commodore Iris Emerald: "Ready main guns! K, if you don't mind?" She looked at me.

K: "Yeah, no, this is not my baliwick." I stepped over to the Comms station and stayed out of the way.

ACDR Jade Notch: "Main Guns, prepare for Air-to-Air!"

Commodore Iris Emerald: "Signal Swiftsure. Attack pattern Alpha." She paced to the lead section of the bridge. "Signal the XY's. Have them drop their troops at the nearest clearing then come up and cover us - attack pattern Bravo."

ACDR Jade Notch: "That means Superb and Swiftsure will make a twinned figure eight in level flight to split the enemy's fire while widening the loops until we're broadside to it. The XY's are instructed to have two in front, one in back, and do a strafing run from underneath." She explained the patterns to me.

Air Lieutenant Cobson Coppers: "Swiftsure reports ready to execute."

Commodore Iris Emerald: "Flight Con. Take the lead, start the pattern." She looked back at me. "Time to test your new cannons."

I'd installed on Superb and Swiftsure a set of anti-aircraft guns, the 90x550mm/L55 Air-Defense Cannon. It was a close copy of the Rheinmetall 88mm/L56 FlAK-18. Superb and Swiftsure had three mounted - two forward, one aft, in addition to five 76mm guns amidships on sliding mounts that could be faced port or starboard. But those 90mm guns were real gems. Instead of single-shell semi-automatic, I'd designed the loader to accept a three-shell top-mounted stripper clip, allowing it to fire a three shell burst. The clip had to be manually loaded, but this allowed a very fast fire time.

Superb took the lead, and both air cruisers started their turns. I listened as the 90mm guns successfully freed themselves of their covered ports at the sides of the bridge. The one in the rear was between the two propulsion fans.

ACDR Jade Notch: "Anti-Air guns ready, Commodore."

Commodore Iris Emerald: "Range to Target?"

ACDR Jade Notch: "Griffons approaching.. range is two-one-triple-oh. Dreadnaught is two-seven-triple-oh."

Commodore Iris Emerald: "Right. Load with shrapnel cartridges."

ACDR Jade Notch: "AA Guns - Shrapnel!" She shouted into the sound-powered phone.

Commodore Iris Emerald: "Prepare to engage." She looked at me. "Seventeen-thousand, right?"

K: "Yeah. Range is 17,500 meters." I shrugged. "Firing at an angle, of course-"

Commodore Iris Emerald: "Set range fuses for one-eight-triple-oh."

ACDR Jade Notch: "Aye. One Eight Triple-Oh." She repeated this into the sound-powered phone. "Guns ready."

Iris paused a moment, and I could see her mentally counting. Max speed of the airship, estimated speed of a Griffon.. speed of the Dreadnaught.. reaction speed of her crew..

Commodore Iris Emerald: "Engage Griffons! Twelve Minute Spread! Continuous Fire!" She shouted.

ACDR Jade Notch: "AYE! AA GUNS - ENGAGE GRIFFONS! One-Two Minute spread! Continuous fire!"

A 12 minute spread, in this case, referred to minute of angle. In short, the AA guns would adjust the spread of their shots 12 degrees from the exact point of center, giving them a cone of fire.

I listened as the guns fired.. rapid thuds, three in a row, a short pause, then three again. Ahead of us, the shells, travelling at exactly 1000 meters-per-second would take 18 seconds to reach the end of their travel, and then explode in a dark puff of shrapnel. The Griffons, by the time they got TO 18,000 meters, were met with incoming shells.

Iris managed to land the shots just above and below them.

I watched as they started falling out of the sky like flies hit with a can of RAID.

Commodore Iris Emerald: "CEASE FIRE! Reload with Incendiary-AP mix. Prepare to engage Dreadnaught. Signal Swiftsure, load Incendiary-AP prepare to engage on our fire."

ACDR Jade Notch: "All Guns, Cease fire! Reload with Incendiary-AP Mix. Prepare to engage Dreadnaught."

ALT Cobson Coppers: "Swiftsure reports ready!"

Commodore Iris Emerald: "Range to Dreadnaught?"

ACDR Jade Notch: "Range is.. one-seven-triple-oh and closing at one-five-zero meters per second."

Commodore Iris Emerald: "Hold.. hold.." She counted again. "FIRE!"

I heard it again, the pauses shorter this time, as the crew had a chance to flex their muscles. The shells streaked across the sky, to the target about 16,000 meters away. Incendiary shells also had a tracer pellet in the rear to allow for spotting. I watched the shells streak right for Dreadnaught's gas bag, and tear holes in it.

Commodore Iris Emerald: "Helm, increase altitude, one-triple-oh."

AENS Youle Tide: "AYE! One-Triple-Oh!"

Commodore Iris Emerald: "AA Guns on continuous fire, fifteen minute spread. Target her gas bag and lifter fans." She nodded.

ACDR Jade Notch: "Aye! AA Guns, Continuous Fire, One-Five Minute Spread! Target Gas Bag and Lifter Fans!"

Dreadnaught never even got in range of.. whatever weapons it had. She went down rapidly, to withering fire from both Aero Frigates.

Commodore Iris Emerald: "Stand Down General Quarters." She finally ordered, watching Dreadnaught crash into a hillside. "Direct the Aero Marines to the Crash Site. I want to know what the hell is going on."

K: "That makes two of us." I stepped up, again. "Excellent, Iris. I can see why you're such a well-respected airship captain. I'm very glad you were in the capital when it was frozen."

She blushed just a bit.

Commodore Iris Emerald: "Y-Yes, General, K." She cleared her throat. "As General K said, Lieutenant." She nodded to Cobson.

ALT Cobson Coppers: "Aye-aye, Commodore."

I paced down to the observation window, and looked out at the terrain. We were getting closer to Coltonville, but Tirek had tried to stop us. I was wondering how.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Green Tree

TIME: 13:21 ESRT
DATE: War Day 509/28 Octavius 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Underway aboard HCMAS Superb, near Coltonville, Northern Equestria

I was pacing the bridge, waiting for one of the XY's that was coming to pick us up. My team was ready, too. Thing is, and I knew this, Iris had done that battle the way she had specifically to impress me - to impress a potential mate with her prowess. She had a problem, and as regrettable as it was, I knew only one way to solve it. I gave up feeling guilty ages ago, but I couldn't help feeling SOME level of responsibility for this.

To be honest, I felt like an unwilling Hentai protagonist trapped in a Harem story, but with that 'Harem' losing sexual interest after one coupling and going on and being friends afterwards. Like nothing happened. Thing is, I'd stopped being unwilling, and just accepted this as part of my fate.

Couldn't leave the wife out, though. In for a penny, in for a pounding.

K: "Iris?" I looked at her.

Iris: "Yes, General?" She was trying to be all-business..

K: "Your Quarters?" I nodded. "I have some instructions for you."

Iris: "Of course." She paced over, and actually took the lead.

I couldn't see it, but just about the entire bridge crew was staring at us. Once we were inside, she took a seat at the small desk in here.

K: "How long have you been crushing on me?" I leaned over it.

Iris: *BEET RED* "S-s-s-since we first... me-met, sir." She was acting like a schoolgirl! "Bu-but, you're married, now.."

K: "It must be bad, or you wouldn't be acting this way. May I ask a lady her age?" I was being.. businesslike, but formal and casual.

Iris: "Thirty-two, sir." She looked right at me. "But.. I.." She looked away and bowed her head a touch. "..have not enjoyed the company of another since I was sixteen. Sir." She was holding on to her formal mannerisms, even as she was rubbing one fetlock over her opposite foreleg.

I sat on the desk, now, and leaned over her.

K: "I'm flattered." I leaned in, closer. "And as for my wife, there's a war on. I have leeway. She understands that certain mares out there find me irresistable." My voice was reassuring, not seductive.

Iris: "I-I couldn't.." She was breathing heavy, now.

K: "She also understands that it's always once-and-done. After a mare gets a taste, they're good. And I have a strong feeling, you're also in Estrus right now." I shrugged. "If I don't do something about it, your judgment could be affected. I'm willing to bet you dealt with it before by ignoring it, and not having a Stallion out there to think about, helped. Things are different, now. You're focusing on me."

Iris: "G-Gen-"

I put my finger to her lips.

K: "Just K."

She actually whined.

Iris: "It's NEVER been this bad before.." She found herself standing up, and sliding over me. "..ever. And I know my.. cycle.. if.. I don't do something.."

On Earth, this would be like Captain Kirk. SHE was the one about to bed the alien.. though, she wanted the alien, not the other way around. Still, the paralells were undeniable.

I gripped her flanks and pulled her into my lap.

K: "You're very attractive, Iris." I leaned in, not quite kissing her.

Iris: "I.. heard.. about.. you." She couldn't find words. "Gods, I'm soaked.."

She was, too. Her marehood was starting to soak through her uniform pants. Soo.. I unfastened her belt buckle.. unwound her sash.. all the while, she was panting so hard, she was making steam. She kicked her own boots off, and I helped her slide those tight pants down past her ass.

With her bottom bared, I got my own pants down, kicked off my boots, and pulled her into my lap.. I had no problem inserting, she was so wet, even though she was practically virgin-tight. She put her hoof over her mouth. She wanted to scream.

I got her shirt and jacket off, leaving her nude. On her desk. In my lap. Around me.

That's when I reached for the sound-powered phone.

K: "This is General K. Applejack, please report to the Commodore's quarters." I delivered that perfectly normally.

Iris gave me a look I can only describe as erotically aroused timidity. Like.. she was afraid of what was going to happen, but she knew it was going to be good.

Applejack took three minutes, as timed by my pumps.

Applejack: "Mmm.. YES, Honeybun?!" She trotted in, already disrobing. "Awww.. Commodore! A fa'hn lady like yew?" She PURRED. "Ah think ah'm begin'n t'enjoy this.."

Goddamned country-fried sex-freak of a wife.. goddamn, I'm a lucky man.


TIME: 16:44 ERST
LOCATION: Coltonville area, Northern Equestria

Sombra: "We found some of the bodies. Not all, but some. They were, indeed, Gorosbif's crew. Were. Now, they are naught but feather dusters." He shrugged. "Long has ponykind been victim to the Griffon. We aren't a match for them, phyiscally, and they're often as smart.. ponies caught alone or uawares have long suffered their indignations and assaults." He shugged. "And predations."

Havoc: "Ehh.. I can see why. Pony tastes real good, Sombra.." He snickered. "I'd say 'ask the Herdiets' but they're already eaten." He gave him a goofy grin.

Sombra: "Indeed. Which is why I am gratified to have predators of our own amongst our number." He nodded to Havoc. "And as friends."

K: "I'm glad you two get along." I shrugged. "Our relationships are very different - Sombra, you and I fought to win over each other's friendship. I saved Havoc and Bella, here." I gestured. "Anyhow, this place needs to be properly secured."

Sombra: "We will remain in the area, encamped, at secured sections of ground, sending out patrols to ensure there is no interference." He nodded.

K: "I'm not sure how far the address is from the former city, or even what's left of the city itself after so long." I shrugged. "Stay ready, though." I looked over at the Airborne Regiment. "Major." I nodded to its commander.

Major Gusty Wing: "General." He paced up with his Bradley out front, across his chest.

K: "Airborne does the patrols. Marines form encampments. I want five of them across a semi-circle along this ridge." I shook my head. "I was hoping to avoid a major expedition like this, but Tirek seems to have forced my hand. Get the 4th Airborne Regiment out here for backup, and have the airships head back for refuelling and reprovisioning."

Sombra: "Of course, my friend." He nodded.

Gusty: "Yes, sir."

K: "Alright, Sombra, you're in charge, here. Everyone else, come on. We have another 10 kilometers to cover before we get to wherever 'there' is." I nodded as my Expedition team got the rest of their gear.

And we started walking.. deep into the woods, in the most northern regions of Equestria, with no land borders in sight.

I had no idea the discoveries I'd make...
