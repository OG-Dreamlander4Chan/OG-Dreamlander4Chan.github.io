December 24, 1011 C.S.
09:06AM, Canterlot Royal Time
Dollar Branch Store, Canterlot


Trixie had strangely taken her assault in stride. She put it behind her almost immediately. Her and Rarity spent the whole night talking, on and off. She was angry, sad, frustrated, and feeling worthless. Like, she couldn't do anything right.

Rarity herself saw this. She saw how hard Trixie was trying this time, how she wasn't flaking off, how she was determined to keep going, no matter what. And Rarity... softened. Especially after that night. She accepted that Trixie was probably going to be a hanger-on to their life for.. the rest of it. That was a big hurdle for her, too. As much as Trixie's antics annoyed her at times, she saw that the world was treating her like a latrine doormat. And she simply could not bear it.

Dusk had his shooting reviewed and approved. While his involvement in the incident was somewhat unusual, even the other partygoers admitted that Davenport had a gun, and he'd used it to force Trixie to stop fighting. So, the shooting incident was classified as Defense of Others, and for the good of the kingdom. This exonerated Dusk from any culpability, legal or civil.

Davenport's fellow partygoers were processed by Canterlot PD. The three that had laid hands on Trixie were catching felony charges. The bystanders that cheered it on, were getting misdemeanor charges, but they were going to be classified as sex crime charges, so, everyone involved would have to register as sex offenders when this was all done.

Other past victims came forward the next day, once it was on the news.

Davenport's business was ruined. The civil suits alone would wipe out all its capital, and probably bankrupt his estate. As collateral damage, 73 people not at all involved in the yearly Hearthswarming Office Party events, lost their jobs overnight, on the days just before Hearthswarming Eve.

Of course, this left Trixie feeling even more miserable.

She was out at the closest Dollar Branch, picking up some snacks. She was so down in the dumps, she just about trudged there. She'd gotten 144 bits in "tips" from the rowdy salarymen, and she was eager to get rid of them. Dirty money is still money, though.

Her basket was half full of horrible cholesterol and processed foods, as she examined an ornament. Hearthswarming trees were mostly a European tradition, but Dusk had a small one in his apartment. Wreaths were more common, as were stocking by fireplaces. Homes that didn't have them, usually had trees instead.

She saw a lady with a small crowd of kids around her. She recognized her - Golden Harvest. She'd gone to school with her.. it was so long ago. Were all those kids, hers? No, that doesn't track.

Noi: "Can we get a couple or'nam'lents, Miss Harvest?" She was peeking at one next to Trixie.

Golden Harvest: "A-ah... I don't know if that's in the budget, Noi." She frowned, not seeing Trixie. "Besides, the Hearthswarming Box will be there later today. They usually have an ornament in there."

Trixie: "...be where, Goldie?" She had the words jump out of her mouth before she even thought about talking.

Golden Harvest: "T-Trixie?!" She looked up suddenly, shocked. "It IS you!" She waded through the kids, and gave her a hug. "Gosh, it's been.. over 10 years.." She blinked, and looked down at the kids. "Oh, I.. uhm.. I'm working at the City Group Home, now." They didn't use the word 'Orphanage' any longer - it 'sounded negative.'

Trixie: "THAT'S what you did, huh?" She smiled a bit, and looked down at the little faces.

They were all looking up at her with wide-eyed innocence.

She suddenly had a rush of memories. Hearthswarming at 7? Spent at Dusk's. 8? Dusk's. 9? Dusk wasn't available, his mother died just before it, she was totally alone for three days.

She realized that her Hearthswarming's had.. sucked.

Hearthswarming Tree ornaments, for those that observe the tradition, are supposed to carry your hopes and dreams. When they sparkle in the light, they're supposed to carry a promise of a better future.

Trixie had to bite the inside of her lip a moment to keep from crying again.

Trixie: "Why.. don't you kids pick a couple of ornaments - Auntie Trixie's treat." She smiled at them.

Noi: "Gee, thank you, ma'am!" She jumped.

Scootaloo: "Yeah! Thank you!" She piped up from the back.

The 14 children set about examining the inexpensive ornaments, divided instantly into two working groups of 7, and debated quickly the merits of each one.

Golden Harvest: "T-Thanks... Trixie.. that's very nice of you." She smiled.

Trixie: "..my childhood sucked. Their's, shouldn't." She heaved a sigh. "Not if I can bring them a few smiles. Besides, it's a buck and change each." She shrugged. "I'm guessing the Group Home is as bad as it ever was?"

Golden Harvest: "Literally, nothing has changed since we were kids, Trixie. And I mean that in ever bad way, too." She crossed her arms. "There's stuff in there that's way out of date, and barely works. We never seem to have the money to get anything fixed. We're lucky to get enough food." She frowned a bit. "Tartarus, for Hearthswarming this year, I.. I gave the Home my family's old tree.." She trailed off. "..be spending it there, anyway.." She lowered her head a bit.

Trixie gave her another hug - voluntarily this time.

Trixie: "Hey, I get it. Life hasn't been headlining in Las Pegasus for me, either." She gave a sympathetic smile. "Wanna.. have me over?" She looked at the kids. "I'll give the kids a magic act. Free." She smiled wider.

Golden Harvest: "OH!" She lit up. "You'd do that?! Trixie... I-I mean.. it's not like we were pals or anything.."

Trixie: "Eh.. we should'a been. Besides, it's for the kids." She finished as the kids came over with the two chosen ornaments.

Noi: "We decided on these! The star ornament can lift our dreams up to the sky! And the large bowed wreath ornament represents our coming together as friends!" An analytical description, but with emotional logic.

Trixie: "I love them. And guess what?" She smiled a bit. "I'm a famous magician - and I'll be performing for you kids tonight!"

They cheered in amazement.

Scootaloo: "What kinda tricks?!" She piped up.

Trixie: "I think.." She shoved her hand in her bag - she still had the 'flash card' trick in there from the other night. "Aha!" She smiled and palmed the device. "You kids want to see some real magic? Watch this." She showed her palms were clear, deftly flicking the device back between her fingers. She rolled back her sleeves, loading the device properly, then placed her palms together, left hand atop right. "Alakazam!" She said, casually. When she jerked her hands apart, there was a small poof, some smoke, and a playing card (King of Diamonds) appeared in her hand.

They all OOOH'D and AAAH'D!

Scootaloo: "That's amazing!" She cheered.

Trixie: "More tonight, kids. Now, listen to Goldie, okay?" She nodded, smiling at them.

Noi: "Yes, Miss Trixie!" She giggled.

Goldie: "Drop by about.. seven? That'll be after dinner." She nodded.

Trixie: "You can count on it, Goldie." She grasped her hands, having unloaded the rest of the trick device deftly into a coat pocket.

As the kids departed.. she got a smile across her face she hadn't had in so very long, she'd forgotten how it felt.

After slipping Goldie 10 bits for the Ornaments and whatever, Trixie went to the food section. Yes, this wasn't the most healthy shit in the world, but she had.. an idea. She texted Rarity..

{Text Message: Trixie (9:17)} - How good r u at cooking

{Text Message: Rarity (9:19)} - Good enough I suppose darling. Why?

{Text Message: Trixie (9:20)} - Want 2 help make some orphans really happy :)

{Text Message: Rarity (9:21)} - On board darling. What are we making?

{Text Message: Trixie (9:22)} - Mince pie. Stuffing with chunks. Pompkin Pie. Hearthswarming Biscuits.

{Text Message: Rarity (9:21)} - Instant or from scratch?

{Text Message: Trixie (9:22)} - Mixed kinda. Coming 2 ur place once i got the stuff

{Text Message: Rarity (9:23)} - See you soon.


She collected what she needed to make sure these kids got something decent. She wasn't sure of the food boxes were still the same from when she was younger, but her mother got them every month. The Hearthswarming box was.. very basic. A couple Biscuits, a small Mince Pie, and a 4-inch Pompkin Pie. Enough for two people, just barely, and no mashed potatoes or anything else, like candied yams.

She. Got. Everything. And texted Dusk.

{Text Message: Trixie (9:41)} - Get to Rarity's. Ur drafted. Cooking 4 orphans. Know u can do it. Ur mom taught u.

{Text Message: Dusk (9:44)} - Ok. Beats watching football all afternoon.

She checked out.. and headed over. Her mind was whirling with plans. The meal cost 104 bits - this was the best way to turn "Dirty Money" into a clean miracle.



10:46AM, Canterlot Royal Time
Rarity's Apartment


Trixie came in with everything. And she had a manic, determined look on her face.

Trixie: "We are going to put smiles on faces." She nodded.

Rarity: "I've not seen you so animated in quite a while, darling." She smiled a bit.

Trixie: "Goldie's working at the Group Home, now, Rares." She shrugged. "It's.. like it was when we were younger." She frowned. "Literally nothing's changed. Nothing's improved." She shook her head. "You never had to deal with that. The Boxes they give for food? It's.." She squinted her eyes, putting down the shopping, with Dusk bringing in the remainder. "..just enough to remind you what you DON'T have." She frowned. "My childhood.. kinda sucked, you know. I want these kids to at least have something." She shook her head. "Am I wrong for that?"

Dusk: "Nah." He shrugged. "And I think we can add one more person to the list, too. She should be here in an hour." He smirked.

Rarity: "Dusk!" She narrowed her eyes just a bit, then softened. "No, no, you're right. She doesn't deserve to be alone tonight. She's helped us. It's the least we can do! Now, then, I think we have a lot of cooking to do, no?" She looked at Trixie. "How are we doing the Mince Pies?"

Trixie: "Trailerpark Mince Pies." She pulled out several cans of canned beef, and some containers of suet. "I'll get the mince all worked up. I got premade shells." She pulled out premade pie shells.

The food traditions around this holiday are pretty straight forwards. The centerpiece of the meal is the Mince Pie. This can be made with chicken, pork, beef, turkey, or whatever's available. The cheapest meats, usually. Then, they mix in a tart apple of some kind - Granny Smith's Granny Smiths had been on sale. To that, lemon or citron, some spices, and then currants or raisins. They had raisins.

On the side were a specific sweet biscuit known as the Hearthswarming Biscuit. It was, more or less, a cornbread biscuit made with honey (and if going cheap like they were, corn syrup or pancake syrup). In the center is a small 'nut' of chocolate inserted after cooking. Trixie was substituting little chocolate truffle things.

Then, things like candied yams, mashed potatoes, and Pompkin pie were included as side dishes and desserts. They also would make Stuffing with Chunks - a simple bread stuffing with some bits of chicken, turkey, or in coastal areas, clams. On rare occasion, some families would have a ham, goose, or turkey. However, Equestrian diets were leaned more towards grains, vegetables and fruit than, say, Griffons. So, meat as a stand-alone centerpiece isn't terribly common.

Hearthswarming Morning was, traditionally, breakfasted with a very hardy but simple soaked oat dish that was akin to extremely dry oatmeal. Gifts of Jams were very common for children the night before, to have with breakfast the next morning.

One of the more fanciful traditions was to wish on the star at the top of the tree. No one really knew where that legend came from, but it was there. Everyone made one wish right before dinner, and held it in their hearts until next Hearthswarming Eve, where, after making the next wish, they'd say what their wish from the last year was.

Starlight showed up, as predicted, at about noon.

Starlight: "Well. Never been in an apartment THIS nice before." She smiled. "I brought something slightly more adult." She hefted a bottle of Hearthswarming Cider, Sweet Apple Acres Reserve. "Just to.. ah.. lift our spirits." She smirked.

Rarity: "Can you cook?" She asked, dicing up some potatoes.

Starlight: "Much better than I can run a town." She shot back, getting out some cups. "I like this idea." She smiled a bit.

Trixie: "My idea." She nodded.

Starlight: "Reminds me of when I was a kid, my mom used to make us..." She blinked, and lowered her head. "...we handed out food at shelters." She pointed at Trixie. "Now I know where I saw her from."

Trixie: "Wait.." She walked over to Starlight. "..when I was 10?"

Starlight: "We snuck away because it was boring." She smiled a little. "Remember? I let you play with my GameColt."

Trixie: "I.." She smiled broader. "..never asked you your name or anything."

Dusk: "Small world." He smirked.

Starlight: "Sure is, G-Man." She giggled, and got some cups from the cupboard that Rarity pointed to.

Dusk: "That was the year my mom died." He frowned a bit. "Dad didn't want anyone over. I wanted.. everyone over." He shook his head. "I remember crying alone in my room." He lowered his head, stirring the pot with the yams. "He didn't even make dinner. He just sat in his study, playing music, wouldn't even let me in. I ended up making a peanut butter sandwich and just going to bed." He sighed. "I'm still sore about that."

Starlight: "Uh-huh.. and you just saved the world from a nuclear cataclysm." She poked his chest. "We might all be ashes or eaten by bugs right now, G-Man. Where does your dad live?"

Dusk: "Here." He shrugged. "He's got a store - Spindle Fabrics. House is attached." He shook his head.

Starlight: "Okay." She nodded. "I'll take over cooking. Go bring him a Mince." She plucked one of the mini mince pies off the stove, quickly wrapped it (showing off her impressive domestic skills), and shoved it in his hands. "You almost died. We ALL almost died. You NEED to DO this, and TODAY is the ONE day of the year we're SUPPOSED to do this!" She pointed at the door.

Dusk: "But... I..." He started trying to back out of it.

Rarity: "..I told you before, I do want him at the wedding, darling." She said, chopping another ingredient.

Trixie: "You NEVER made peace with him." She hissed. "It's why we started hanging out at Rarity's all the time."

Dusk: "..." He looked at the Mince Pie, and nodded slowly. "You're right. We might all be dead right now if things happened a bit different." He frowned. "Trixie, you.. remember how my mom was.."

Trixie: "I do. I remember she welcomed me to the table every night. She.." She cry-giggled a bit. "..Dusk, she was basically my mom, too. Hell of a lot better than that drunken bitch." She sniffled. "..darn onions.."

Rarity: "You owe it to yourself, and her, darling." She paused to look at him. "Nearly dying - twice in a week - should be an alarm bell that you may not have forever."

Dusk: "I-" *Sigh* "-alright." He shook his head. "Alright, alright.."

So, with that, Dusk went and cleaned up, got dressed fully again, and.. departed.

Starlight: "Odds?" She blinked as he closed the door.

Rarity: "Seven to one against." She nodded.

Trixie: "I'll take that action." She put a bit coin on the counter.

Starlight: "Game." She added a coin to the pile.

Rarity placed 14 coins down, and shrugged.

Rarity: "I do hope, darlings, that I lose this bet." She smiled again, and returned to her task.


12:18PM
Spindle Fabrics, Canterlot


Dusk entered the shop. It's been ages since he was here, but it all looked pretty much the same as it had. A few minor updates. There's a stallion at the counter he doesn't recognize.

Dusk: "Ah, hi. Is my fa- Is Mister Spindle in? And why are you working on Christmas Eve?" He paced up.

Bright Scrolls: "..because the old miser insisted." He said, venomously, without thinking. "You have an appointment?"

Dusk: "..go home." He shook his head. "I'll talk to my dad." He sighed. "Back office?"

Bright Scrolls: "Back office." He nodded. "Your dad? My sympathies." He went and fetched his coat. "You haven't been here in at least three years - that's how long I've been working for him. He's gotten bad." He frowned. "The first year I was here, it was no decorations. Then, no wishing customers Happy Hearthswarming. This year? No bonus, and no time off. He wanted me here at 6AM, to 6PM." He shook his head. "If he fires me, he fires me."

Dusk: "He won't. I won't let him." He looked at the Mince Pie. "Go home." He lowered his head, and flipped the sign on the door from 'open' to 'closed.'

There wouldn't be any customers today. He knew it. It was Hearthswarming Eve. His father was just doing this to be petty, to hurt others. He went into the back to the loading docks and saw three other workers sitting around the delivery trucks.

Dusk: "Let me guess - nothing to do but you're ordered to be here anyway?" He shrugged.

Crafty Crate: "Yeah." He shrugged. "How'd you know?"

Caramel: "Because that's Brindle's son." He nodded.

Dusk: "Go. Home." He ordered.

Caramel: "Good enough for me." He tapped the others. "Come on."

With that, Dusk went to the house part of the structure. Really, the business and the house were one and the same. The house was the business, the business was the house. When he entered, it was like going into a time machine. Nothing.. NOTHING had changed. Not a single thing was different from 21 years ago.

Dusk: "DAD?" He called out.. heading to the office.

He entered, and saw his father sitting, facing away from him, at his desk.

Dusk: "Dad." He walked up, but his father said nothing. "Listen, Dad.. I.." He sighed. "Rarity and I are getting married. She wants you there. And.. come on, Dad, it's Hearthswarming Eve. We.. Mom wouldn't want us to keep fighting all this time! Come on, it's been over 20 years."

He walked over, setting the mince pie next to him, and put a hand on his shoulder.

Dusk: "D.. Dad?" He shook him. "DAD?"

Nothing. His body was... cool.. it had no resistance.

Dusk: "DAD?! DAD!!" He pulled on him, and Brindle slid out from his chair and on to the floor.

He wasn't moving.

Dusk looked at him in horror. He knelt down and felt his neck. No pulse. Nothing. His neck was also slightly cool to the touch. He wasn't just dead, he'd been dead for hours.

Dusk: "..I'm.. too late.." He fell over his father's body.. and sobbed. "DADDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!"


5:44PM
Rarity's Apartment


Dusk came back in, having put on a fake mask of stability. He walked in, and saw that they were ready to finish the last of the biscuits, and get them into containers.

Dusk: "Looking good." He nodded, but moved stiffly as he entered.

Rarity: "Seems I won the bet." She nodded.

Trixie: "It's written all over his face." She smiled a bit.

Dusk: "Wh-what wager?" He looked up, getting some of the boxes stacked and ready to get into his car.

Starlight: "We wagered whether or not you'd make it up with your dad." She shrugged.

Dusk: "Ah, well. I didn't get the chance. Dr. Horse said it was a massive coronary, about 8 this morning." He said, matter-of-factly, as he took the first load of food out to his car.

All three girls froze in their tracks. Not one of them said anything until he came back inside.

Rarity: "DUSK, DARLING!" She and the others surrounded him. "Oh..!"

Trixie: "Dusk.. man.." Her face was screwed up with pain.

Starlight: "Dusk.." She even called him by name.

Dusk: "..don't." He put up his hands. "If you make me think about it, I'm going to flip out. Those kids are counting on us. I'll cry later." He nodded.

Trixie: "..oh.... okay.." She still hugged him.

They all did.

He managed to hold it together enough for that. Once they were done, the talking stopped. Starlight didn't know Brindle, but she understood pain. Trixie had been the last one of the group to speak to him, 11 years ago. Rarity respected him, and was hoping that once they patched up their differences, she could get materials from him she wouldn't be able to get elsewhere - plus, the idea of having a grandparent close by, appealed to her, since she wanted foals. She never knew her own grandparents, and she wanted her foals to have that experience. For Trixie, it was that Brindle was a substitute dad for Jack Pot.

They finished cooking, and loaded up all their vehicles. They then convoyed over to the Group Home. They'd arrive just in time for dinner.


6:12PM
Canterlot Group Home, Canterlot


Golden Harvest: "Okay, kids. Everyone has their dinner plates and things? We can start serving." She tried to smile - the food boxes were barely enough, this year.

Just as she was about to lament their situation further, in came Dusk, Trixie, Rarity, and Starlight.. with food. Lots of food.

Dusk: "HAPPY HEARTHSWARMING EVE, KIDS!" He was decked out in his Class "A" Uniform, beret and all.

All the kids suddenly cheered.

Trixie: "And after dinner? You'll see some REAL MAGIC!" She smiled, she was in her more relaxed magician girl outfit - slacks, bow tie ruffled tuxedo shirt, and long tailed coat.

The kids cheered again.

Rarity: "And after THAT, you're all getting measured for winter coats. My treat." She smiled at them, with her bag full of tailoring equipment.

They kids cheered even louder.. then looked at Starlight.

Starlight: "Ehh.. I'm a convicted felon. Wanna hear some stories of what jail is like?!" She flashed a menacing smile, but the rest of her face was cheerful.

The kids all laughed.

Golden Harvest: *Tearful* "OH! GUYS! Th-thank you!" She sniffled. "I-I don't know what to say..!" She laugh-cried as they got the food all set up.

Dusk: "Eh, a simple 'thank you' is enough, Goldie." He gave her a hug and whispered the news in her ear.

She hugged him very tightly back.. then pulled back.

Golden Harvest: "Anything." She said, firmly.

Dusk: "We'll go for drinks." He shrugged.

The kids were all dished up. They had heaping plates, and huge smiles. This alone was worth it. The girls were fussing over them. Dusk? In his deep desire to forget the fact that both of his parents died on Hearthswarming Eve (21 years apart), he had to distract his mind. He started looking around.

The Hearthswarming Boxes. They caught his eye. He knew what the individual boxes looked like, he saw them at Trixie's all the time. He noted that there were exactly half as many boxes as there were kids. One box was unopened. He fished out his pen blade, and cut the tape, taking a look inside. As he expected, there was a small mince pie, Pompkin pie, and two biscuits. There was nothing else in here. It was just enough for two servings.

The box sent to the group home for them was still intact - Golden hadn't taken the things out, yet. Inside was canned condensed milk, butter, dry stuffing mix, and rice. No oats. There was enough here for about 12 small servings of stuffing-with-rice. Not quite enough to go around.

He immediately got the feeling that something was very fishy here.

He went to the office at the back of the building. Goldie was the only one working today, it seemed. The facility director's office was easy to find. He.. just picked the lock and went inside.

Dusk: "..of all the.." He frowned.

There was at least another dozen boxes in here, a stack of privately donated things, and two more large boxes.

The cup of coffee he saw on the desk was still steaming. The director was here.. so, he quickly slid into the closet, and shut the door. Just in time, too, as she came back in with a scruffy looking stallion.

Director: "There you go." She said, pointing to the boxes. "That's enough to feed two per box." She nodded. "And if you want any of that stuff over there, my palm IS open." She smirked.

Scruffy Dude: "Alright." He moved over to the boxes of private donations. "Strange. No one ever asks?"

Director: "Seriously? They're orphans. Who cares. No one. The donations are tax write-offs." She shrugged. "I keep the cash. Got me that nice car you saw."

Dusk drew his sidearm and very quietly slid a magazine into it. He then very slowly pulled the slide back, and eased it forwards.

Scruffy Dude: "I think I'll take the turkey, too." He chuckled. "Might just cook that myself."

Dusk threw the door open, and aimed into the room.

Dusk: "The only bird that's cooked is YOU! Nightwatch! You're under arrest!" He looked at them both. "HANDS! NOW!"

They both raised their hands. Dusk smiled to himself, being able to pull off a badass one-liner like that.

Director: "I don't believe this! You had The G following you!?" She hissed.

Scruffy Dude: "ME!? MORE LIKE YOU, BITCH!" He barked back.

Dusk: "Shut.. UP." He demanded. "Both of you, come over here to the chairs and sit." He directed them. "I need to call the local police." He frowned. "Embezzlement, theft of government property, child endangerment, and anything else I can think of." He shrugged a bit as they both took a seat across from him, as he moved behind the desk.

Director: "I don't.." She shook her head and snorted. "..I want my lawyer."

Dusk: "Just a second." He dialed 9-1-1 on the office phone, which he put on speaker.

911 Operator: P> "9-1-1, what's your emergency?"

Dusk: P> "Subaltern Dusk Seeker, Nightwatch. I have two subjects under arrest at the Group Home. I need a blue-and-white, and I need my supervisor contacted." He kept his aim on both of them.

911 Operator: P> "Understood. Backup unit is on the way. ETA three minutes."

Dusk: P> "Tell the backup unit, no lights or sirens, when they pull up. I don't want them scaring the kids. Come in on the office side, south side of the building." He never took his eyes off of them.

911 Operator: P> "Understood. Instructions relayed. Sending a message to Nightwatch HQ right now."

Dusk: P> "Thank you." He hung up. "Now, then, let me advise you of your rights under the Royal Charter.."


7:24PM


Dusk strolled back into the main area, with the kids just starting to finish their food.

Noi: "Mister Dusk!" She motioned him to come over. "We saved you a plate and a seat!" She smiled at him.

He took his seat, across from Rarity.

Dusk: "Sorry about that. I had to fix a problem." He looked over at Goldie. "Your supply shortage is about to end, Goldie." He smirked. "Your boss was embezzling." He beamed a grin.

The kids whispered that around the room, and cheered.

Goldie: "REALLY?!" She sounded upset. "How much?!?"

Dusk: "The kids won't be near starving... like.. ever again. And by her own admission, she embezzled several tens of thousands of bits in cash, too." He shrugged. "Looks like you'll be getting a promotion."

Goldie: "Looks LIKE it!" She smiled. "Oh, Dusk.." She shook her head. "..just like the football game. You're my hero." She smiled broadly.

She was referring to the Homecoming Football Game in their Junior year, where Dusk made a 72-yard run for the winning TD against their bitter rivals, South Canterlot High. That had guaranteed she'd become Homecoming Queen with her boyfriend at the time - Caramel, of all people. While they didn't end up staying together, that had been a big, happy memory for all of them.

Trixie had made sure her football star was WELL REWARDED for his impressive deed, too. This being one of the periods in their lives where he and Trixie were an item. Even though they hung out at Rarity's by that time.

Dusk reflected on the fact that his father.. never attended any of those games. Even the State Championship he managed to get the team to in his senior year.

He was thinking about how.. it was too late.. for them.. but, Trixie snapped him out of it.

Trixie: "That's Dusk for you." She shrugged. "He's a wonderful guy."

As Dusk finished his food - eating quickly being a soldierly skill - Trixie got up and went for her magic things. She was going to do one of her safer routines for the kids. No explosives, no fire, no sharp things. But, it would be impressive none the less.

THIS time, she could do the 'teleportation trick' without causing a terrorist attack.

Her stage was all set up, too. Noi insisted on sitting in Dusk's lap as he watched Trixie perform her magic act. She used Rarity again for the teleportation trick, and only set off a small smoke bomb to distract the kids as Rarity moved to the other box. A little magical hologram confetti as Rarity emerged, and the kids were absolutely blown away.

Trixie's other tricks of the evening included a whole rack of card tricks, from the "written-on deck" to the usual 'pick a card' but with the twist that she never touched the deck, Rarity did. And the card still came up exactly as planned. Again, the kids went crazy. Even the unicorn children that were just learning basic magic theory were absolutely astounded.

Trixie ate this all up. She loved seeing them smile. In her own head, she was making absolutely sure that these kids would have a GREAT Hearthswarming Eve. Thanks to Dusk's heroics, and Rarity's jacket donations, they would, too.

For her final trick, Trixie did the 'saw a woman in half' trick with Goldie. The kids were giggling to themselves that this would give them two Miss Harvests to take care of them. Of course, the trick went off without a hitch.

After that was done, Rarity went about measuring each child for a new jacket. She made sure to fudge the numbers a bit, to account for growth. 14 jackets for kids? She could have this completed in a few days. No problem. They'd all have Rarity-brand jackets, and she would get FREE advertising. Not to mention the good will of the people for such generosity.

As she was measuring them, Dusk saw it in her eyes. That desire to have kids, and that.. enjoyment.. of just giving of herself for selfless reasons. Her generous heart and grace had been among the many things that had drawn him to her. He smiled to himself.

After all the festivities, they all headed back home. Well, to Rarity's, anyway. She insisted.


11:34PM
Rarity's Apartment


As soon as they got in, Dusk got out of his Class "A" uniform, and got back into jeans. He brushed the uniform off, sitting in Rarity's bedroom, fixing it up just so...

Rarity: "He never DID approve." She slid in, and sat next to him.

Dusk: "And now, I can't apologize." He tried to hold it in.. and he failed.

She embraced him immediately, holding him close to her. Stroking his hair, letting him let it all out. He wasn't shy about his feelings with her. And the last week-and-change had been VERY emotional indeed. She realized that she hadn't made time for this, for him, to decompress, and talk out his pain and fears.

Brave as he was, he had them. She was the one he went to, about them. She let him talk, let him vent, let him let it all out, so he wouldn't keep things bottled up any longer.

Dusk: "Celestia-damnit, Rares..." He finally pulled back. "I.. I feel like.. I just failed Mom. Like.. I screwed up and it's ALL my fault." His lip quivered. "I.. I still loved him. And I never got.. to tell him.." He gasped for air, and sobbed some more. "I never.. I never got.. to say.. I'M SORRY, DAD! I'm sorry! Celestia, I'm so sorry! I just wanted you to be proud! I ne-never wanted you to be.. ashamed!" And the sobbing came back, his words unintelligible.

She just held on to him, finally laying back on the bed with him, and let him cry. Twenty years of pain, resentment, and now forever unresolved parental trauma.. she let him let it all out.

She made a note that, from now on, every Hearthswarming Eve would have to be EXTRA special, to chase away this negativity. This pain. And she would have to be there for him, until that pain subsided. She knew it would never fully go away, but she could help heal it until the pain was tiny.

She also realized that until Trixie and Starlight found themselves their own families or whatever - even if they did - they'd be part of this day for the rest of their lives. That suited Rarity just fine, she thought, as they fell asleep in each other's arms.

After all, togetherness is what this holiday was all about.
