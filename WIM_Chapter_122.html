Part 1: Working Holiday

TIME: 15:24 Equestria Royal Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)
DATE: War Day 945/9 Solarus, 1004 C.S. (Equestrian Calendar)
LOCATION: Baleston, Maresechusetts, Equestria


I did the thing. You know, where you walk out on to your home land, and kiss the ground? I did that.

I also had some fans waiting for me.

Mane Houlihoop: "General." She paced up. "Thought ya' might like somethin' local." She patted me on the back. "TY!" She beamed a grin.

Typhoon Surge: "Ah! Mane!" He trotted over. "General, I see you've met my cousin."

K: "Yeah." I nodded. "I had no idea you were related."

Behind us, there was a clunk.. as one of our F/A-2's was lowered off of the Cloudsdale's flight deck. It was all shot up. That was Ensign Blu Berriberry's plane. She was injured, but her plane took the brunt of it. I remember, Cloudsdale needed arresting wires to stop it, the gas bags were all punctured.

Typhoon Surge: "Come on, K. Let us take you out, hm?" He shrugged.

K: "Jackie?" I tilted my head to her.

Applejack: "Shure!" She looked over at the others. "Ah think y'all're dismissed!"

K: "Indeed. Everyone, 48 hours shore leave in Baleston. Then, we head back to Canterlot." I nodded.

Teeka: "Ahh.. Teeka.. stay with Human and Human's Wife. Not want get shot!" She blinked.

K: "Sure, Teeka." I shrugged a bit. "Come on."

The five of us went around the Market area of Baleston. As I'd more or less taken Teeka in, I just bought her things. I'd have to.. you know.. see if she was competent enough to manage her own finances (I was pretty sure she was) and live on her own.

We had.. oh.. the best dinner. Lobster Rolls, Baleston Clam "Chowdah," Parker House Hotel rolls, and a Boston Cream Pie for dessert. All this at the Parker House Hotel, where Ty's family was working.

The Parker House Hotel was also reserved for CAG. Most of the hotel was taken up by us and other senior staff.

Teeka, Steela, AJ, Dusty, Luna and I all had one room - the Penthouse.

We relaxed up there, after a long afternoon of shopping and foods.

K: "That.. was fun." I flopped onto the bed. "Ohh.. feels good to be back home. More or less."

Teeka: "Teeka make new home here." She smiled, swinging her legs over the side of a chair. "Teeka like ponies." She smiled broadly.

Luna: "Perhaps, child.." She nuzzled her. "..more of your kind can have their hearts opened to see we can be friends."

Teeka: "Teeka hope so!" She batted her eyes. "Ponies nice. Like Teeka. Care about Teeka." She shrugged a bit. "Make Teeka very happy."

K: "I'M just glad you understand that, while I like you, I do not want you in -that- way." I said, getting my top shirt off, leaving me in a t-shirt.

Teeka: "Teeka understand. K loyal to his mares. But Teeka special friend to him." She went and flopped on one of the couches. "K Human take good care of Teeka."

K: "No kidding, I will." I nodded as Dusty laid on my belly.

Dusty: "I.. wish I'd been there." She finally said.

Applejack: "Here it comes." She frowned a bit. "Go on, Sugar Cube. I know yer gonna say it."

Dusty: "Once AGAIN.. I wasn't there and I almost lost you two." She sighed.

K: "..you TWO?" I cocked a brow, looking down at her.

Dusty: "Yeah, I mean, you a-" She stopped, and blushed, realizing what she just said. What she MEANT.. what IT meant.

Applejack: "Aw.." She slid up on the other side of me and rubbed noses with her. "..fer any consolation.. yeah." And she blushed, too.

Luna: "At least I am assured that My General's other mate is to be well cared for." She blushed a bit herself.

Steela: "Do not forget me." She slid up under my head.

K: "I get it. Even if I'm not here, there'll be.. something. The kids'll get well cared for." I shrugged a bit.

Luna: "Indeed, My General."


TIME: 08:14 Equestria Royal Daylight Time (ERDT)
DATE: War Day 946/10 Solarus, 1004 C.S.

I didn't even realize when I fell asleep, but when I woke up, even Teeka was on top of me, curled up, seeking my protection. It struck me that a good chunk of her had that child-like fear of powers over her. That, while she could stand up, she still didn't feel herself strong enough to really do so - that she needed someone stronger than her, to protect her.

I really hoped she'd find someone that made her happy.

Once again, I was stuck. And extracting was more difficult since Teeka was clung to my shirt. But, I managed, finally.

Out in the foyer area of the penthouse, after showering and dressing, I called for breakfast to be sent up. I expected people to be coming and going. I didn't expect my three newest comrades to show up almost as soon as the breakfast carts were brought in.

Dusk: "..and so, that's how we managed to open trade with that village we passed through.."

Rarity: "Oh-hoh-ho.. DARLING! It seems you had adventures even before K came into our lives! How lovely!" She patted his arm as she came in with him. "Oh, K!" She wiggled a little, in absolute joy. "I would say it's official, darling, but I think you already knew that."

Dusk.. BLUSHED.

K: "Good. Grab some grub." I nodded, toasting them with my coffee cup.

Broken: "Oh, sir, he's not the only one who had some adventures. Though mine were far more tame." He smiled, entering, with both Golden and Fluttershy.

K: "Trying to discover the secrets of the soul, Broken?" I shrugged.

Broken: "Somethin' like that." He smirked. "More.. seeking t'understand." He shrugged. "I gotta admit.. it's.. this war's given me a new angle to consider."

Golden: "Oi. Ah was mainly in'ta fitness b'fore the war." He nodded. "Had me a job at a radio store, though. S'pose that's how I got picked fer Signals!"

Fluttershy: "They're both very interesting, K!" She smiled, sweetly.

K: "I'm glad to hear it. Now, we're on Liberty for the rest of the day, and tomorrow. Day after, we'll depart for Canterlot on my command train." I shrugged. "Just be at the central train station by 10-hundred, day after tomorrow, morning." And gestured to them. "Other than that, please, enjoy the town. And remember, once we get BACK to Canterlot, you're all free for two weeks rest, then back to duty while we plot our next move."

Rarity: "Indeed, darlings - rest is important. Both for the body, and the soul." She wiggled her butt a little as she kinda burrowed her backside into the couch, after grabbing her breakfast.

Rarity wasn't just happy.. for the first time since I'd met her, save a few brief moments.. she was completely at ease. That was a far cry from her, normally. Dusk.. broke through that little self-imposed isolation and self-idolitry of hers. She'd set herself some impossible standards, forced herself to hate "making-do" with "just an affair," and denied she'd ever really deserved to be truly happy.

Now.. she was. I could see it.

K: "..when's the wedding?" I smirked, looking down at my coffee cup.

Dusk spat his coffee out at high velocity, in shock.

Rarity turned TOMATO RED almost instantly.

Dusk: "Kah-K! Ah-I-Uh-Uhm..!"

Dusk was no better in the self-denial department. Both because of the incredible stigma of being an "imperfect" pony among perfect ponies, and because of his own issues of self-loathing and sense of familial abandonment.

They were MADE for each other.

Rarity: "..the gentlecolt should court me properly first." She finally said.

Rapid Bearing: "Is THAT what you call breaking the bed, last night?" He wandered in, smirking, and making bold with the breakfast carts.

Again, Dusk and Rarity BLUSHED HARD.

K: "I'm planning to go shopping around town, later." I shrugged. "Who wants in?"

Broken: "What're ya shoppin' for, K?" He tilted his head.

K: "Anything that strikes my fancy. Gifts for my kids, wife, other lovers, friends.. maybe even myself." I shrugged.

Rarity: "Our dear General has a weakness.." She turned her head to Dusk. "..he does not buy himself any gifts. Doesn't ever feel he's earned them, darling." And turned back to be with a smug grin.

Dusk: *Ah-hem* "..I see I'm not alone in that." He made a small grin, and nodded his head to the side a little.

K: "Eh. I think it's pretty typical of guys with our specific mind set." I looked over at Broken. "We feel everything we earn, do, and save, should go to someone else. Like, we can just make do with whatever. Not necessarily that we're unworthy, but that we feel others deserve it more than we do." I looked back to Dusk. "The important thing - and one I don't think either of US ever learned - is what the.. limit, I suppose, is. Like, when do we feel that we've given enough, and are worthy of something ourselves."

Broken: "..hmmmm!" He smirked, leaning in, analyzing everything over his waffles.

Dusk: "Ya got me, K." He smirked on the other side of his mouth, avoiding his scar. "I have a feeling we've got more in common than we think."

K: "Enough so, at least, that I feel I can implicitly trust you." I shrugged. "Same with everyone here."

Golden: "Ah, awesome!" He beamed a grin. "Nice t'have good friends, yeah?"

K: "Sure is." I nodded.

Teeka came trotting in about then, and looked around.

Teeka: "Teeka smell tasties!" Her eyes lighting up, seeing the breakfast spread. "ooooOOOOooooo!" And she set about making herself a plate.

K: "Teeka.." I started.

She looked up at me with those big ol' eyes, smiling a mile wide.

Teeka: "Yes, K?" She addressed me, as she moved over to the couch occupied by Dusk and Rarity, and sat down, swinging her feet, and eating.

K: "..you say you know finances." I lead in.

Teeka: *Mmph* "Yes! Teeka know maths. Teeka have much knowledge about maths and figures and spread sheets and things." She nodded rapidly, chewing some bacon.

K: "How would you like to really help out around here?" I shrugged a bit.

Teeka: "Ohh.." She blushed a bit. "..Teeka help Great K any way K ask." That was delivered without double entendre.. she seems to have figured out I'm not going to bang her.

K: "I'd like you to join the Gendarmes with Chemical Lens, they're acting as our intelligence unit for this war, too, and I'd like someone that understands Tirek's paperwork to look at the things we've captured over the last four years, and be available to analyze anything we capture in the future. So we have a better understanding of how things work behind the scenes." I gestured a bit.

Teeka: "..Teeka help?" She furrowed her brow. "Like, Teeka REALLY help?"

Dusk: "We don't understand the enemy's paperwork. You.. do." He shrugged a bit. "I believe K is pointing out that you're a priceless resource to us - perhaps with your knowledge of how the enemy moves and works, logistically, can allow us to intercept and interdict those logistics. Logistics win wars - both having good ones yourself, and denying them to the enemy."

K: "Dusk is on target." I nodded.

Teeka: "Hm. Teeka like this idea." She nodded firmly. "Maybe Teeka be really free, now.." She blinked and looked down at her eggs. "..really free. No masters."

K: "I never was your master, Teeka. Just your friend." I put a hand on her shoulder.

Teeka: "K good friend." She blushed a bit. "K give Teeka freedom, and job, and.. future, even, maybe."

K: "For sure. IF we win." I gave her shoulder a small rub.

Teeka: "Teeka smarts will help us win." She said, with determination.

K: "That's the spirit. I'll arrange it when we get back to Canterlot." I nodded.

Dusk: "What was that about finding talent and using it, K?" He smirked, and let the scarred side of his mouth do it.

Broken: "I's wonder if.. we could get through to th' Goblins." He pondered. "I mean, I understand now - from what ya explained - tha' some races are a lost cause. Porcine especially, since they're livin' magically animated weapons. But.. Goblins are intelligent." He raised his head to look at me. "Cou'd we get through to them?"

K: "Maybe on a small scale." I shrugged.

Teeka: "Mmm.." She rubbed her chin a moment. "..find Elder Gob. Elder Gob in good standing. Maybe him have voice others hear." She nodded firmly. "But.. all Elder Gob are kept in Tirek lands."

K: "To keep US from getting through to them with the Power of Friendship." I rubbed my chin. "Deliciously devilish, Tirek. He understood the assignment." I shook my head. "That guy seems to be a good step ahead of us at almost every turn, with us nipping his heels at each opportunity. The race is really dead even."

Dusk: "Meaning, despite our victories, we're still not at a turning point in the war." He shrugged.

K: "We've decimated the equivalent of a single Army Group and several full on Fleets so far." I shrugged. "But, that's probably only 1/3rd of his naval forces and perhaps 1/20th of his land forces. And now, he has air power." I nodded. "Depending on how fast he can put new ships in the water, and replace his combat losses on land, we've barely made a dent, on paper. And don't forget, we've had some pyrrhic victories along the way - where we've prevented him from winning, but he's still done damage. Yeah, we've not hit the turning point, yet, militarily. We need.." I looked out the window a moment. "..we need a Midway moment."

Dusk: "Don't follow. Something from Earth?" He nodded to me.

K: "Before Midway, there were no victories. After Midway, no defeats. Winston Churchill. Though not entirely accurate, the Battle of Midway in the great war I keep mentioning was a definite turning point in it, as one of the belligerent nations lost its main striking force and most experienced pilots all in one fell swoop. This had a knock-on effect in morale and made victory in one theatre almost guaranteed.. allowing us to focus more on the second major one." I gestured to Dusk. "We need to, militarily, find and engage Tirek's forces in a major set-piece battle and win it as cleanly as we can. Not necessarily taking the fight to him, but.." I made some hand motions, stood, paced, and sipped my coffee. "..something where he loses the equivalent of a whole Field Army or more, and one massive fleet, and a large number of planes, all at once." I pointed to Dusk. "And one of his most elite land formations, too. Not some gobbledygook scrap unit. We need to kick him in the balls, as it were, not just fend off his strikes. Both to show that we ARE winning, to our own ponies, AND to show to the smarter ones in Tirek's ranks that.. he's not as invincible as he seems." I ended with a two-arm shrug, palms out (except the one holding the coffee saucer).

Dusk: "Which.. would.. perhaps.. get them to start silently defecting, or going AWOL, or.. even just looking for a way to escape." He smirked, then grinned. "A military and morale victory."

K: "My only concern is.." I set the saucer down. "..what if he's been holding back this whole time? Like, by a lot."

Dusk: "That he, in turn, has a larger force than we think, but doesn't want to risk its destruction, as he'll need it for occupation duties." He paused, looked down, then up. "And what about that Breaching the Barrier thing you mentioned?"

K: "That was brought up, too." I nodded. "That his ultimate goal is our enslavement, so he can breach the barrier and claim the lands beyond it." I raised my head. "What if he's working against the clock, somehow?"

Broken: "Tha' might explain his.. seemin'ly piecemeal attacks an' operations. Usin' just enough force instead'a overwhelming force, and us, by chance, jes' findin' out his plans." He was in his element, again, considering the possibilities.

K: "That he's holding back. That he might have to win on a budget, in a set time frame. It must be.. like.. on the scale of under a decade, but.. more than just a couple years." I shrugged, pacing, and refilling my coffee. "We know how fast he can replace his losses, ROUGHLY.." I snapped my fingers, pointing at them. "..and if he has a certain time limit, he can only risk X amount of forces on Y endeavors, lest he not have enough overwhelming force to take on whatever's beyond the barrier. He needs to win under specific terms." I gestured with one arm. "Maybe it's a cycle. He wants to get it done as fast as he can, but he'll get another chance some time later." I shook my head. "Okay, we need to learn more about the Barriers. It'll help us understand Tirek's military objective time frame better."

Dusk: "Agreed." He nodded to Broken. "Good thinking."

Golden: "Well.." He raised his head. "..once we're back on duty'n'all.. go on down t'Princess's College in Ambleon?" He smirked. "They got all kinds'a ancient texts'n things in their magic library."

K: "Good thinking." I nodded.

Well, now we had a plan. Something resembling one, at least. It was better than being at Square One with no idea where to go. A rest was in order, though. And we'd take full advantage of it.

[End of Part 1]

Part 2: Marching Home

TIME: 14:47 ERDT
DATE: War Day 946/10 Solarus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Baleston, Maresechusetts, Equestria

The Ambleonian Fleet had arrived a couple hours ago, and combined with the Canidans, the town was very full of sailors, marines, and other personnel.

Most of them were keeping to the restaurants and bars. Soldiers will be soldiers. A few of them were by the Baleston Playhouse, which was doing some rotating free performances for the troops almost constantly for the next few days.

Relaxing, unwinding, and realizing they were safe and secure. I knew the bulk of the Ambleonian Fleet would depart for Scrapey Flow in a few days, but a couple of ships from Ambleion had arrived from there with some supplies needed.

We got intercepted, in fact, by Blueblood and a few of his royal staff. One of which was pulling a cart.

Blueblood: "Ah! K!" He nodded, as a Magpie excitedly squirmed from the luggage and flew instantly to Broken's shoulder, chirping madly.

Broken: "Magellan!" He beamed, happily. "There's me friend!" He nodded a little, kinda.. kinda trying to get what Magellan was prattling on about in Bird Language, before turning to me. "Magellan, these're me new friends. That's K, the Human. His wife, Applejack. Me friend Golden, over there. Tha'there's Dusk, an' Rarity, and this is Fluttershy."

Fluttershy: "It's nice to meet you!" She beamed.

Magellan: *Twee-TWEET! Chitter-chirp, chirp!*

K: "Ah.. I.. didn't catch that." I looked at Fluttershy.

Fluttershy: "He's happy to meet us." She blushed a bit. "And he thinks I'm the prettiest shade of yellow."

K: "You're a flirt." I nodded to him.

Magellan: *CHIRP!* He struck a pose, and nuzzled Broken.

Fluttershy: "He says Broken-"

K: "Is his best friend in the whole world." I nodded. "I don't need a translation for THAT one." And smiled.

Broken: "Aye! Ha-hah! Oh, we've been together a while, haven't we? Jes' two winged fellers hangin' out." He smiled, though, pushing his glasses up a bit on his snout.

K: "It's nice to have animal friends." I shrugged.

Fluttershy: "Mhm! Harmony is going to be so happy to get home." Harmony, I hadn't realized, had been with her the entire time, and was now peeking out from her mane, and.. conversing with Magellan, I think?

Applejack: "Shoot. Winona's gonna be real happy t'see us, too." She blinked. "Come on, ever'pony. We got shoppin' ta do!"

Blueblood: "I'll have the rest of the luggage dropped off at your hotel, K, so Golden and Broken can get settled in when they have time." He nodded to them. "Your uniforms are in there, as well. I've had my tailor update them to your new proper ranks. Broken, you'll still be a member of the Royal Ironish, and allowed to wear the Beret of an officer, now. You'll simply be seconded." He nodded. "Golden, since the Yorkshires aren't a Royal regiment, you're officially transferred to the Administrative Office, On Assignment."

Golden: "Aye, suhr!" He raised to attention, but didn't salute.

Broken: "Aye, sir!" He nodded. "Thank ye, sir."

Blueblood: "You're in CAG, now. Do us all proud." He nodded and departed.

Dusk: "Mmm. That'll be something, won't it?" He smirked.

Rarity: "From what we have seen, they shall be fine additions." She nodded.

The shopping.. dear Celestia the shopping. Remember the time I took Rarity to Manehattan? This was worse. FAR worse. Even Fluttershy got in on the act! She was as bad as Rarity, but her eye was more on knickknacks. Rarity went nuts on clothes, and on cloth material to make clothes FROM.

AJ and I? We went after snow globes. We'd gotten one in Jakarta (literally the only one we could find), and I wanted to get one for the Griffon Kingdom as well - luck would have it, we found a shop still celebrating Gorcat's accession to the throne.

K: "I miss him, Jackie." I said, holding the snow globe that displayed the capital and the palace.

Applejack: "Ah do, too, hun. An' Sunshine. An' Pinkie.. Berry.. all'a'em." She put a hoof on my hip.

K: "Some of them are on to higher duties. Some of them.. eternal duty." I hefted the globe, and looked at the shopkeep - a griffon named Gerald. "How much, my good Griff?"

Gerald: "Nah, no charge. You're the one that freed us from the curse. That's payment enough." He nodded. "My cousin in Gryfton.. he.." He smiled. "..talked about how everyone's jut doing so much better, now. Those Engineers and all that. The new water systems. Canals. He says the Harvest'll be even bigger this year." And nodded. "Please. Accept that as our gift."

K: "I.. don't feel right about that." I shrugged, and put a 10B coin down - the going price for the other globes he had. "You have a family to feed, too."

Gerald: *Choked up* "Human.. by the Nest, if anyone talks trash on you, I'm going to buck them up, but good." And nodded. "A deal well and done, then, sir."

K: "Thank you, sir." I nodded.

We rejoined the group in time to see three carts being dragged by three large stallions behind the others.

Dusk: "I can tell my retirement pay is going to be well used." He was smiling, though.

Rarity: "Nonsense, darling." She gave him a small, coy poke. "If anything, I shall be so famous at the end of this war, everyone who's anyone will pay a premium to wear my fashions. And in so doing, we shall be.. QUITE.. comfortable."

Dusk: "'WE' huh." He smirked, letting his scar lift.

Rarity: "We." She tautly tufted her tail between her flanks - a rather overt flirt. "There is no doubt in my mind."

K: "Yeah." I nodded. "Don't go getting shot again." I smirked.

Dusk: "Oh, I'll try NOT to, but Tirek may have other plans." He grinned.

K: "Uh-huh. We'll interrupt them." I shrugged. "Come on, it's about time for dinner.."

The next day, of course, was mainly rest and relaxation. We didn't go shopping, but we caught a show instead, and basically lazed about the hotel, doing jack fucking shit.

Well.. I shouldn't say that. Dusty, Luna, and Applejack made me.. very tired. Several times. At once.

And very, very sore.


TIME: 08:58 ERDT
DATE: War Day 949/13 Solarus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Ponyville, Erie, Equestria

We disembarked the train as we got close to the town. The tracks were still incomplete from the Tornado tearing them up, and as the whole rail yard in town was just getting finished, the diversion track to Canterlot was still in place.

K: "Welp, it's not too long of a walk." I shrugged - town was less than 200 meters away. "Come on."

Forest Spirit: "Hey, K." He nodded. "It's been a bit since we were back home." And shrugged. "Formals?"

K: "Yeah. Let's do this right." I nodded, and drew my sword. "COMPANY! PARADE FORMATION, BY FOURS!"

All the ones with me, smiling, some giggling, did as instructed. They lined up by rank order, with Havoc's Canids and Seven's Vulpines separated.

Forest Spirit: "Company ready!" He acknowledged.

K: "Marching Home, everyone. We use Dex's lyrics." I nodded, and I heard Dex clear his throat, and start humming the baseline.

All: "When ponies come marching home again,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
We'll give them a hearty welcome then,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
They all will hear, as the foals will shout,
Then everyone will all turn out,
    And we'll all feel brave,
When ponies come marching home."

Mares: "The old church bell will peal with joy,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
To welcome home our friends deployed,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
The village colts and fillies play,
With flowers, they will strew the way,
    And we'll all feel brave,
When ponies come marching home."

Stallions: "Get ready for the jubilee,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
Well, give the heroes three times three,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
The laurel wreath is ready now,
To place upon their loyal brow,
    And we'll all feel brave,
When ponies come marching home."

Mares: "In the year One-thousand one,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
We faced a foe and dealt a blow,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
Buffalo friends we made that day,
and Tirek's force did fade away,
    And we'll all feel brave,
When ponies come marching home."

Stallions: "In the year One-thousand two,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
That was when the war went through,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
Celestia called and we turned out,
and Tirek gave a fearful shout,
    And we'll all feel brave,
When ponies come marching home.

Celestia called and we turned out,

Mares: "In the year One-thousand three,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
Far to north did friends we seek,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
A fight begun and Tirek won,
But friends we never gave up on,
    And we'll all feel brave,
When ponies come marching home."

Stallions: "In the year one-thousand four,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
We found the foes behind our door,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
A traitor's sin was done in,
And to mountain peaks we did win,
    And we'll all feel brave,
When ponies come marching home."

All: "Let love and friendship on that day,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
Their choicest treasures then display,
    Hurrah, hurrah!
And let each one perform some part,
To fill the joy of warriors hearts,
    And we'll all feel brave,
When ponies come marching home!

And let each one perform some part,
To fill with joy the warriors hearts,
    And we'll all feel brave,
When ponies come marching home!

   And we'll all feel brave,
When ponies come marching home!"

("When Ponies Come Marching Home" based on "When Johnny Comes Marching Home" by Louis Lambert, 1863)

We sang this as we marched into Ponyville. And, indeed, the townsfolk turned out cheering our arrival. There were tears. There were flowers thrown. Mayor Mare came charging out of the new City Hall, jumping for joy like a young filly again. Golden Harvest lined up some of the Militia that were in town and rendered a salute as we passed.

K: "Please. My Lord, God. Anyone that's listening. Don't let this song get too much longer." I whispered, as Golden Harvest came up and hugged me.

We were home. For now.

Rolfe: "MOM! DAD!" He zoomed over to us as fast as his little legs could carry him.

Little. I'd been gone for two months. He'd grown.

K: "There's my boy!" I squatted a little and held my arms out.

He threw his legs over me and hugged me. Tightly. Then went and hugged Applejack.

Rolfe: "Heh.. I-I.. missed you." He smiled, choked up a bit.. and with his VOICE cracking.

K: "Uh-ohhhhhhh! I KNOW THAT SOUND!" I pointed at him.

Applejack: "Mm.. sounds lahk mah Colt's becomin' a Stallion!" She beamed.

Rolfe: "Aw, ma!" He blushed, but quickly snapped out of it. "HEY! W-see what I can do!?" He trotted over to one of the donated apple trees (which still had some fruit on it), and smirked. "Watch this, Ma!"

Our boy wheeled around, and KICKED the trunk. Nay. BUCKED.. the trunk.

Every single apple but one, fell into the baskets at the base of the tree trunk.

HE stood there smirking.

Applejack: "OH, MAH SON!" She looked so full of excitement, I thought she was going to explode. "OH! MAH BOY! MAH BOY!" She was overcome, almost staggering over to him, weeping tears of joy.

Rolfe: "Watch the last one." He pointed up with a hoof, and as it fell, he got his flank under it, and whipped his tail to it just as it got in-line with it, sending the apple PERFCECTLY into my hands.

Like a baseball.

K: "M.. MY SON, TOO!" I couldn't stop the tears. I fell to my knees, and embraced him again, as Applejack did. "Our boy! OUR BOY RIGHT HERE!"

Parental pride is an amazing thing.

At the time, I didn't think about how close he was to enlisting.

Pomme and Starlight came out next, followed by Koringo. Pomme and Starlight each had one of the twins in a saddle bag. Hugs. So many hugs.

K: "My girls!" I gripped all three of them in my arms.

Koringo: "Papa-san home! Happy!" She nuzzled my neck.

Pomme: "OUI! PaPa and MaMa are home, now!" She gripped my neck tightly, and then hugged Applejack.

Starlight: "I'm glad to see you, Daddy! And Mommy Applejack!" She nuzzled my face. "We missed you."

K: "I'm so glad to be home." I sniffled, and went from a squat, to a loping crawl over to Granny. "Granny!" And hugged her, too.

Granny Smith: "Ah! Mah two-legg'd grandson's back!" She hugged me tight. "And none too worse fer wear!"

K: "I'm in better shape than I thought I'd be." I smiled.

Granny Smith: "Mm.." *Sniff-sniff* "Y'fought Tirek again, didn't'cha?" She leaned in real close.

K: "Yes, Granny, I did." I nodded, almost bowing to her.

Granny Smith: "Mm. Welp, 'bout time y'got the Apple's secrets, too." She said, nonchalantly, and started walking towards the orchard.

Applejack: "What'cha talkin' about, Granny?" She followed, and I followed behind her.

Koringo: "Fam'ry secret? Oooo!" She giggled, and trotted along as fast as her little legs would carry her.

I ended up just scooping her up.

Rolfe: "No idea! This sounds cool, though. Come on, sisters!" He strutted proudly, leading behind me.

Starlight: "..yeeah, be RIGHT back, dad!" She charged into the house, and came back with her personal Sherman VI slung over her back, and a cloth bandoleer around her neck. "Never can be too careful." And she handed Pomme her personal Custer.

Pomme: "Oui. We finds zee troubles." She sighed, checked that the cylinder was full, and stuck it in a pocket on her dress, tying the pocket shut.

Rolfe: "I got my Lee. I'm good." He nodded.

The group of us got over to the far, far side of the Orchard, over the furthest hill. This was one of the very few spots that had not been destroyed by the mystical Tornado five months ago.

There, in that spot, was an Apple Tree and a Pear Tree. Intertwined. Forming a heart.

K: "Oh." I blinked. "What's this, then?"

Granny Smith: "Oh, just a relic of a forgotten history in our family." She nodded. "We're related to the Pears."

K: "Care to explain? Your maiden name was Orchard, if I recall." I shrugged.

Granny Smith: "Mhm. Mah husband was Red. Red Delicious Apple. Son.. Bright Mac." She nodded to Applejack. "Yer paw."

Applejack: "Pa.." She blinked, and stroked the brim of Sidewinder's hat.

K: "And her mother?" I nodded to the trees.

Granny Smith: "..Pear Butter." She blinked.. a tear formed. "She went bah Buttercup after.. her paw.. kinda.." She looked down. "He's livin' here in town. His orchards're just fine." She turned to me and took the Sword of Rainbow's Light from its sheath with her mouth, planting it in the ground between the two trees.

K: "..I have to make peace in my family, or I'm not worthy to wield it." I nodded slowly.

Granny Smith: "Ah always said yew was a smart one!" She beamed a grin. "There's more, but.." She shrugged. "..go on, now. Git. Y'all got werk t'do."

K: "Come on, everyone." I nodded. "Pomme - go get Mac and Apple Bloom. Sidearms." I nodded.

Applejack: "Y'all thinkin' he'll take a poke at us?" She smirked, but frowned.

K: "I don't think so, but that doesn't mean our enemies aren't skulking around. Remember, the nation was infiltrated pretty badly, and Chem and the other Gendarmes have been hunting them this whole time." I shrugged.

Applejack: "Good point, honeybun." She said, as we got back to the Farm. "..ah'm'a grab mah Sagebrush." She said, after a moment's thought.

Once armed, and with the entire family in tow, we went over what we DID know.

Big Mac: "Sis probably don't remember much, but.. the Pears and the Apples helped found this town." He nodded. "Granny and Grand Pear had a feud goin' on - lots of pears an' apples, few bellies to fill'em. As it happened, Pa 'n Ma was in love. Not sure.. exactly what all happened, but.. I knows the Pears moved away to Vanhoover, Wenatchee b'fore we was born. Left the pear orchard, though." He shrugged.

K: "A case of commercialism - they were in competition, and he folded, making Ponyville an Apple town." I nodded a bit. "Even then, before the War, you were always one bad harvest from disaster."

Big Mac: "E'yup." He nodded. "Simple economics. We're the main game in town, but.. there's still the Pear Orchard. Ah think one'a the distant family look't after it. After Grand Pear left, though, I know they didn't come 'round town no more."

K: "Not that it matters - everyone's horses, you can easily walk out to the pear orchard and buy direct. The old Marketplace was more convenience than anything." I shrugged a bit.

Big Mac: "E'yup." He nodded. "Plus, there's other things we eat besides apples."

K: "Soo.. do we just go confront him?" I shrugged. "Or do we want to get the full story?"

Applejack: "..ah'll be honest, honeybun." She stopped me and put a hoof to my hip. "This war's taught me one thing - y'all better make yer peace while y'can, or ya might not get another chance." She shook her head. "Come on. Let's go see Grandpa."

K: "Right to the core of the matter." I smirked, realizing I'd made an apple joke.

Apple Bloom: "Y'all're b'comin' more like us ever' day!" She beamed.

K: "Yeah." I smiled a bit. "I hope I survive and I get to stay here." I brushed my hand through Apple Bloom's mane, and rest my hand on AJ's shoulder, moving forward a bit to keep pace.

It took us some time to reach the farm.

The farm.

I quivered and fell to my knees.

Applejack: "HONEYBUN!? You okay?!" She instantly moved over to me, and lifted me up in her forelegs.

K: "I.." I was tearing up. "..there's a reason Granny told me." I forced myself to stand, and went about correcting my uniform. "Stay here until I call for you." I nodded, getting my wits about me.

Applejack: "..okay, honeybun. I trusts ya." She kissed me, though, much to the snickering of the foals.

Me? I righted myself.. and started walking.

Walking.

It looked too much like it should have, to be a coincidence. It wasn't. It couldn't be. I knew it. I knew it had to be exactly what I thought it was.

An elderly stallion was there, carefully boxing up some pears. A roll of hay was off to the side, with a pitchfork in it.

How do I greet him?

How do I greet.. one of my heroes?

K: "..you're a long way from Iowa."

That's how.

Grand Pear: "Hm." He stopped. He didn't look at me. "You didn't pronounce it right."

Here, it's called "Eyeowah" and is enunciated as multiple syllables.

K: "Yes I did. Admiral." I said, not letting my knocking knees sound aloud for him to hear.

Grand Pear: "Heh. I'm no admiral. Just a pear farmer." He went back to putting pears into crates. "I.. came out here.. for a change of pace."

K: "No. The Nexus sent you here." I stated.

Grand Pear: "Wh-" He finally turned to face me. "So, you ARE human."

By GOD almighty, he looked like him.

K: "Yes, Admiral. I am." I rendered a full salute.

Grand Pear: "..stop." He shook his head. "I'm not.. him.. any more." He gestured with a hoof. "Look around you. This.. this was my life. A long life. A wonderful, fabulous life.."

K: "If anyone deserved it, you did." I lowered my arm.

Grand Pear: "So. Where are YOU from?" He gestured.

K: "Chicago, originally. From the year 2012. And, no, neither your.. former nemesis.. nor his ilk.. existed in my world." I shrugged. "You've SEEN alternate dimensions. YOU know it's possible."

Grand Pear: "HAH! Hahaha.. I suppose I have." He smiled, wickedly. "No one with you?"

K: "Nope." I nodded. "Don't happen to have a Phaser I could take apart?" I smirked back.

Grand Pear: "Nope." He nodded to me. "Have a seat. What's your name?"

K: "K---- K---." I sat down. "I like to think.." I shrugged, and said the name of one of his crew. "Kinda.. wished that was me, sometimes.. or one of my own descendants. Remember him?"

Grand Pear: "Very vaguely." He nodded back.

K: "Anyway. You were just a TV show where I'm from." I smiled again, though, unable to contain it, dismissing the emotion. "And one of my heroes. I actually adopted your mannerisms as a way of throwing my enemies off balance. I admit to borrowing a few of your tactics.. AND your commitment to there not being any such thing as a no-win scenario."

Grand Pear: "Well, I'm glad someone has." He chuckled. "But, you're not here because Klingons have suddenly arrived."

K: "No, sir. This is about your life here. The one you lived. I'm.. by marriage.. your grandson, sir." I smiled a bit. "And that thought brings me no end of joy."

Grand Pear: "Aha." He nodded. "Granny sent you?"

K: "She did. We'd like to make peace." I gestured. "You're a good negoti-"

Grand Pear: "I was a fool." He nodded. "I was a fool, K----."

K: "MMm." I sighed. "You have my word, I'm not going to tell anyone. Not that they'd get it."

Grand Pear: "I.. thought you might say something like that. If you.. truly are.. a student of my.. adventures." He gestured again. "You'd also be smart enough to.. know when to, and not to, speak."

K: "Oh, yeah." I nodded firmly. "Listen. I can't.. I can't replace the friends you remember, but I would like to be a good Grandson to you, for whatever time I have." I said, softly.

Grand Pear: "Thank you." He nodded, a twinkle in his eye. "Settle this and.. maybe.. I'll tell you a few stories I don't think your television show.. would have covered."

K: "You got it." I smiled.

Discord, you magnificent bastard. I bet you were behind this. It makes too much sense.

I realized.. this also meant I was banging the granddaughter of James Tiberius Kirk. Or, rather, some.. reflection of him, that knew who he was.

THIS CERTAINLY EXPLAINS HER DESIRES IN THE BEDROOM! OH, MY GOD. IT FITS TOO WELL. NO WONDER SHE'S AS BAD AS ME!

K: "So.. let me.." I gestured. "What happened? Between you and the Apples?"

Grand Pear: "I was jealous, is what it was.." He got up and bade me follow him, so I did. "..I didn't think.." He paused a moment, just inside the house, looked down and away a second, then shook his head and kept walking. "..is it the nature of this place to be so honest about our feelings? Or is it just me being old?"

K: "Both." I shrugged, following him. "I've noticed a change, too." I frowned a bit. "I didn't used to care this much."

He led me to a rolltop desk, and opened it, revealing a.. very, very large pile of unopened letters and things. Huge, even.

K: "What-"

Grand Pear: "She wrote me every week, asking for forgiveness, I guess." He cleared his throat. "I don't know. I never read them. Then.. one day.. they.. stopped coming." He stopped, and grew very cold. "I knew, then, something had.. happened." He slammed his hoof into the desk, once, hard. Then.. softer.

I saw tears roll down his snout and drip onto the desk top.

K: "Grand.." I lowered my head. "..it-" I stopped myself. "We both have a son named David." I said, realizing what he was going through. What this MEANT to him. And I almost fell backwards, sliding into the nearest chair.

Grand Pear: "HAD." He spat.. then suddenly turned to me. "AM.. I.. CURSED.. to fail my own children!?" His face was utter anguish. "NO MATTER WHAT LIFE FORM I AM!?"

K: "I can't.." I shook my head.. goddamnit, I'm supposed to be the one with all the answers.

Grand Pear: "Two." He sniffled a bit. "TWO." And looked out the window. "Even in.. this.. PERFECT WORLD.. SOMEhow.. SOMEway.. I just can't stop being JAMES T. KIRK!" He swept his foreleg over the coffee table and cleared it. "Oh, sure.. I can.. I can face down a whole FLEET of Klingon Battlecruisers.. BUT THAT'S IT! I can't.. be a father.. a husband.." And rocked back to his haunches. "Even in a place like this. A place.. so PERFECT like this." He gestured madly. "I JUST WANTED TO PROTECT HER!" Tears were pouring from his eyes.

K: "..I feel the same way about my kids." I stared straight at him. "Do you want to know how it happened?"

Grand Pear: "For whatever it matters, I-"

K: "She died saving her daughter. MY WIFE." I was choked up, too.. I wiped my face. "She.. went into the Everfree Forest.. alone. Unarmed. To save her. From Timberwolves." I snorted snot back into my nose. "She died protecting her." I lowered my head. "So did her husband. They fought them off until Granny could get there." I put my head in my hands a moment. "She didn't die needlessly on some stupid self-destructing planet at the hands of some bloodthirsty idiot.. she died.. for a reason." I raised my head back up, staring at him. "She died.. for her family. To save her daughter." I nodded to him, then shook my head. "It doesn't matter. You.. YOU.. taught.. her.. that every life was precious, didn't you?"

Grand Pear: "Yes." He nodded back to me. "It's.. one of my core values, I-"

K: "She took that lesson to heart. She died fighting. Protecting. Saving." I nodded slowly to him. "She dove in there without a second thought." I leaned in. "You may have lost her.. but you didn't raise a coward, a fool, or.." I looked out the window myself. "..someone that just doesn't care." I looked back at him. "Her death was her choice." I nodded, then shook my head again. "You can't.. protect.. all of them." I looked down a moment. "There are.. thousands.. of names.. faces.. in my head right now. Each one fell in this war. I can't save them all." I looked back up to him. "Neither can you. And I think that's the most painful lesson you never accepted."

Grand Pear: "..I guess you're right." He took a sharp inhale, and wiped his face again. "I-I feel like a kid.. I.." And chuckled. "I don't think I've ever cried like that before." And tried to play it off with his signature Kirk Grin, in pony form. "So! I have great grandkids, do I?" He said, changing the subject.

K: "Yeah. Arthur Turner and Liberty. Plus Pomme Florale, Starlight Mint, Koringo, and Rolfe." I nodded with a smile.

He was okay, now. He.. his heart.. across two lives.. finally accepted something he'd never been able to before. His own weakness. A man, a legend, that died twice to save others, but was also running away from his own pain in the process.

This world.. healed him.

Grand Pear: "Sounds wonderful." He nodded, smiling a bit. "I think I'd enjoy being a grandpa. For once."

K: "You'll get it." I nodded. "But, I want to do something for you." I shrugged a bit. "Even if it WAS your.. former life."

Grand Pear: "Oh? Going for a quick two hour tour to Pluto, or.. just a simple training mission?" He chuckled.

K: "The Crystal Kingdom has an Airship named Enterprise. She's not YOUR Enterprise.." I nodded a little. "..but, she's.." I tilted my head to the side. "..you know how this world is. Things have feeling and spirit when they rightly shouldn't. She's a lady of similar bearing. Thought you might like to meet her, that's all."

Grand Pear: "Hahaha..! Alright." He nodded, grinning, just a touch of that glint in his eye. "Once. And.. don't expect me to enlist or anything." He shook his head.

K: "I.. did want to ask.." I lowered my head, then looked up. "How do you remember coming here?"

Grand Pear: "I never left the Nexus. I.. I remember.. another Captain of the Enterprise coming to see me, but.. when I tried to go with him.. he vanished and I didn't." He shrugged. "After that and.. and even before that.. I just have these little flashes of things. Riding horses.." He looked down at himself and poked his own belly. "..being on my farm in Iowa.." He looked down, wistfully. "..Carol." Then shook his head. "Just flashes. Then, I.. I woke up.. and.. I was a.. a baby. A little foal. I didn't rightly recall what was what until I was a young man.. er.. colt. And by that time? Well.. I'd.. fallen in love.. I was getting married.. and James T. Kirk was a long, long ways away." He nodded.

K: "You saved the day." I nodded back to him. "Some reflection of you went back with Captain Picard, and you saved the day. One last time." I looked to the front door. "Now.."

Grand Pear: "Now.. I have.. one last duty. Grandfather." He smiled widely. "Call them in?"

K: C> "AJ, come on ahead. Bring the kids." I looked back at Grand Pear. "Emotional breakdown, confronted the past, apologies given, sad story.. no past lives mentioned or existing."

Grand Pear: "You're on." He nodded, and smiled, as we got the coffee table stuff picked up.

And so, I met another legend. Or, the ghost of one. It didn't matter. He was now.. just Grandpa. And that's all that mattered. Healing sometimes takes more than one life, it seems... but, that's why we have friends. And as I always say..

..friendship is Magic.

We spent time catching up with him. He hugged all the kids. We sat and read some of Pear Butter's letters. Mac told Grand Pear what he remembered, and so did Jackie. We told these things to Apple Bloom, showed her photos.

So she'd remember.

Getting back to the farm, I went on ahead to the Twin Trees.

K: "..how much do you know, old mare?" I said, pacing over to Granny and kneeling down.

Granny Smith: "More'n I can rightly remember sometimes." She didn't kid around with that - her voice was somber.

K: "How old are you? Really? And Grand?" I nodded in the direction of his orchard.

Granny Smith: "212." She nodded, grinning wickedly. "He's a bit behind me. 207." She gestured a bit. "Our feud was foalish, K----." She said, heavy with regret. "We both loved our kids."

K: "He wanted to.. protect her." I shrugged.

Granny Smith: "..I know." She looked up at me, right in the eyes. "And.. I know why." And smiled, then lowered her head. "Not all the details. But, I know enough."

Father Waddle: "Mm.. and you must learn these things, my child." He paced out from behind the tree.

K: "You're all ancient." I nodded to him. "You said you're older than Chrysalis."

Father Waddle: "Those of us that reach true advanced age.. if we're smart enough.. can find a way to keep going."

K: "And stay young looking." I nodded to them.

Granny Smith: "Mhm." She patted my cheek. "Got'ta stay pure, though. Once'ya pops out a kid, that's it."

K: "You.. got married." I gestured to Father Waddle.

Father Waddle: "I was. Yes." He looked at the two trees. "My niece, Elsie, came to see me." He nodded wisely. "Take good care of her."

K: "I will. I swear. As good as I can." I hugged Granny. "All of them."

Granny Smith: "I know ya will." She squeezed.. tighter than I thought she might be able to. "NOW! You beat my little riddle, it's time for your reward!"

K: "Can it be pie?" I smirked a bit.

Granny Smith: "Oh, that was already planned fer after dinner." She said, getting up, and moving over to the sword.

I just noticed.. a few tiny vines had started to make their way up the blade.

K: "..Earth Power." I blinked.

Father Waddle: "You DID say he was a smart one." He grinned broadly.

Granny pulled the sword from the ground, and paced back over to me.

Granny Smith: "Yer married to an Earth Pony. This'll come easy fer ya. Now, you ain't so strong in magic, but you got enough. With this power, you can.. do things.. with plants. Make 'em grow, make 'em die, maybe even make 'em listen. You'll figger the rest out." She handed it to me.

K: "Thank you, Granny." I accepted the sword, and held it, looking at it. "I can.. feel something." I said, sniffing the air. "Smells like.. my grand uncle's farm." I smiled.

Granny Smith: "Mmm! Good! NOW!" She bade us follow her. "Time for supper! An' I made us a special one, t'celebrate yer return!"

Oh, Granny!

I was walking. Outside of town, just enjoying the sights, and enjoying being at home. The sun in the skies, the birds in the air, the MARE AT FULL GALLOP HEADING RIGHT FOR ME!

K: "NO, NO, WAIT, STO-"

*WHUMPF!*

We rolled end over end. I wound up on my face, and she.. managed to hop back up on her hooves.

Mare: "Oh, I'm.. terribly sorry, are you alright?" She leaned down to look at me.

So I pulled myself up, finally, only to see.. probably the oddest pony I'd ever seen before. Very, very curly mane, sharp almond-shaped eyes.. but her mane.. was a very human shade of blonde.

Her coat was blue, though. And her cutie mark was a book.. a closed book.

I accepted her hoof as she helped me get up.

Mare: "Ah.. a human." She said, narrowing her eyes a bit, and looking me up and down.

K: "Ex-Excuse me.. 'A' human?" I tilted my head. "Like, you know what I am?"

Mare: "Oh, of course! I mean.. I'm human, too. Or, I was. Kind of." She giggled a little, and shrugged. "Are you one of his companions?"

Gears turned and clicked in my head as she said those words with such confidence, such surety..

Companion.

K: "You.." I wagged a finger at her. "..you know one of the Doctors!" I blinked. "Erh.. got a name?"

River: "Oh, terribly sorry! Dr. River Song is the name I go by." She smiled, just a bit.

K: "Huh. M'kay. I'm sorry, I never watched the Doctor Who TV series, so, I have no idea. Which Doctor-"

River: "I believe.. the 11th." She nodded, smiling, and blushing at me. "My husband."

K: "Ooooooooohhhhh... kay." I nodded, and blinked a few times. "Couple things?" I said, very matter-of-factly. "This is a world of ponies. He's not a Time Lord any more. We don't TALK about any of that here. And we are in the middle of a war-"

River: "Oh.. I suppose he hasn't stepped in, yet." She said, almost dismissively.

K: "Yeah, funny that." I matched her tone, but with clear reverence. "I may not know the details, but I know The Doctors are sta- uh.. MEN.. that must be greatly respected." I gave a bit of a shrug. "He can't." Intervene, I meant. "Like I said, not a Time Lord any more. This is my fight. Our fight. Their fight." I shrugged wide. "Come on, River. I'll take you to the Social Club."

River: "Alright." She smiled a bit. "I bet this has been an adventure.."

K: "A very tragic one at times, but I understand that's kinda par for the course, eh?" I chuckled.

River: "Oh, indeed." She said, with a tone of excited sadness.

She didn't say a word until we got there, but stopped me before I opened the door.

River: "This.. seems to be YOUR place. Not his.. ours." She shrugged a bit. "What.. do I have to look forwards to?"

K: "Be honest? Either he breaks the rules and goes off with you, or you end up with a VERY mundane next forty to fifty years or.. eternity, for all I know. Heck, The First Doctor is in there! So you might be immortal?" I shrugged wide, and flapped my arms at my side. "Oh, I'm K----."

River: "Nice name, that. Irish?" She gave me a reassuring grin.

K: "Yeah, partly." I knocked twice, then just opened the door. "Twister? You have a-"

I was on my ass in seconds, as the two lovers flew onto each others hooves.

Dr. Whooves: "Up you go!" He lifted me under my arms (and was pretending to be David Tennant again). "I know you'll keep a secret, so.." He patted me on the shoulder, and escorted me to the bar area, going from humanish to Pony the second I looked away.

K: "Who is she?" I asked, taking a seat, as a bottle of coke was.. right in front of me.. and I just took a sip from it.

Dr. Whooves: "The future me's soul mate." He smiled broadly, as Derpy slid a plate of muffins between the three of us. "Just as Derpy is mine."

K: "Colonel." I nodded to her, smiling.

Derpy: "I've done some things I'll never tell anypony for the rest of my life." She leaned in and hugged me. "All because of you."

K: "Mmm.. this is another reason you became eleven different entities. You really are 11 different people with a shared brain in some ways." I shrugged, munching a muffin.

Dr. Whooves: "Indeed." He nodded, smiling.

Time Twister and River came up to us at this time.

Time Twister: "K, thank you for everything." He shrugged.

K: "Don't tell me why you are, I'll just accept the thanks without question." I smiled.

River: "You were right." She nuzzled him. "He IS interesting."

Time Twister: "Indeed. And that's exactly why you'll leave him be. This is his and their's fight. Not mine or ours." He looked me up and down. "I might be back before the end. I might not. We're.. going on holiday."

K: "Yup, have fun. And if you make it back before I vanish, bring me a pizza. Meat Lover's. From Earth. Chicago, if possible." I shrugged a bit.

Time Twister: "Oh, certainly." He smiled broadly.

And that's how it was my fault a Time Lord found his soul mate again.. and how Time Twister made himself scarce because.


TIME: 17:12 ERDT

Later on that day (after spending an hour in the social club that turned out to be 5 minutes when I looked at my watch), Applejack decided SHE wanted some.. shirts. Sexy shirts for couple's time. Button down, night shirts, flirty tank-tops.. and who better to go to than Rarity?

Only, we heard a commotion in the Boutique. A loud one. Sounded violent. So, we both drew down, ran to the door, and Jackie kicked it. I was first one in.

K: "Er.. Rarity? Dusk? You two alright?"

Rarity: "..and this, darling, is why you.. NEVER.. argue with a Lady.."

Dusk: *MRflgrfhl!*

Applejack: "Dusk? Rares?!" She moved ahead of me, and into the boutique's design room. "RARITY! AH'M SHOCKED A'CHEW!"

When I saw what I saw, I reholstered.

Dusk and Rarity. With Rarity's ass smooshed into Dusk's face.

K: "What?!" I moved in right behind her, to see her flanks just about wrapped around his muzzle. Mind, she IS wearing pants, and Dusk looks annoyed, not aroused, but the talon of discontent had been stuck into the situation.. "..REALLY, you two! I'm SHOCKED and APPALED, sir!" I crossed my arms, and smiled.

Rarity: "OH MY GOODNESS!" She leapt off of his face so fast, you thought her tail was on fire.

Dusk: "..AIR! Air.." He heaved a few breaths. "Ah.. ehh. uhm.. sorry.. sir, but uhm.. just a little hoof-to-hoof practice..!" He turned BRIGHT RED and got to his hooves.

Applejack: "..uh-huh. We was goin' on a picnic.. seems y'all got to the cake already." She ribbed Dusk like a bro.

K: "Indeed. Come, Applejack, let's let the new couple.. work out.. their differences.." I smirked, and led her away.

Rarity: "IT ISN'T WHAT YOU THINK! And.. and.. it's not like K hasn't done EXACTLY THE SA-"

She froze, we froze.. then everyone laughed.

I don't deserve such good friends.

The war was still out there, demanding of me. But, I would address it in time. For now, I was just glad to be enjoying some R-and-R at home.

After all, this is what we're fighting for.
