Part 1: Without A Party

TIME: 23:33 IT
DATE: War Day 763/7 Quintillius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Artesa de Segre, Navarre

Everything of the Chaos Realm had vanished when Discord died. The people, however, did not return. I knew Discord well enough to know he wouldn't have killed them - something else did. I had a feeling I knew what that was, but I wouldn't say it.

Instead, Toola and the Girls were hanging up Fiesta streamers. We were going to celebrate the life of Pinkie Pie, right here, right now.

Toola and the girls? Toola WAS one of the girls, now.

Celestia was asleep in the cargo bed of a 2-ton truck, and I was in there with her. Pinkie doing what she did, drove even her to tears. She had sobbed until the sun went down. All the girls did. So, I'd crawled in the back of the truck with her, and held her close, like a Father would the Mother of their children.. after losing one.

Luna got up in the back with us.

Luna: "She was so noble." She nuzzled me.

K: "She made me promise. Two years ago. I've known, this whole time, she was going to do this. She trained Toola to take her place. She imparted her Pinkie Sense to her. Pinkie's been prepping for this since before I ever came here." I shrugged. "Maybe without me, she wouldn't have had the chance? Or been forced to? But, then again, Toola wouldn't be one of our friends, now, either, I bet."

Luna: "None can know the future, My General." She got up behind me. "How's my sister?"

K: "Sleeping. Fitfully. That was.. like a daughter to her." I shook my head a little. "More than, say, Berry Punch was. She selected Pinkie to be an Element, she gave Pinkie the extra power she needed to pull this off, not to mention put her in a position where Pinkamena could be cast out of her." I caressed Celestia's neck a bit.

Luna: *Sigh* "I.. I feel profound loss, too." She slid in closer and threw her legs over me. "Oh, K----.. I know she would not want us to be sad.. but.." She nuzzled the back of my neck.

About then, the Emperor came up.

Emperor no Ken: "K----." He had never addressed me by my full name before - I didn't even know that he knew it. "De rloss of so dear a friend.." He cleared his throat, not quite knowing how to deal with this.

K: "Your Imperial Highness. My only request is that you enjoy the party. She would have wanted that." I nodded to him.

Emperor no Ken: "Daishiro." He lowered his head a bit. "We are friends, K----."

K: "Daishiro." I nodded back to him.

To say this was exceptional.. is an understatement. Me, a Gaijin, an ALIEN.. was now on a first-name basis with the Emperor of Neighpon.

Luna was awake all night, but I was pinned between her and her sister the whole time. The party started at about midnight, and continued on through the morning. I fell asleep, though, just listening to Celestia's heart beat, and comforting her, as her sister used her power to ensure the three of us, tranquility in the dream realm.

Somewhere in there, Applejack came and curled up with us. Eventually, all the girls did.


TIME: 09:00 IT
DATE: War Day 764/8 Quintillius, 1004 C.S.

I awoke buried in horseflesh, and managed to worm my way carefully out. I'd slept in my boots, and now they felt all funky - I'd have to take them off at some point and let them air out.

I paced over to the party tables, seeing that The Lads, Forest Spirit, and a few others, had made sure to arrange security details, as they partied, drank, and passed out. I went and sat next to Katrina, as she made some coffee.

K: "I'm going to miss her, probably most of all." I started.

Katrina: "Oh, boy, do I ever understand.." She said, as Havoc paced up.

Havoc: "I get it, too, K----." He nuzzed me. "But, we can do this. We can move forward." He nodded firmly. "She wanted us to be safe from Discord.. she accomplished that, for all time."

K: "She even deepened the bonds of friendship with her departure." I shrugged a bit.

Katrina: "Hah! I suppose she did, at that!" She smirked. "Ah.. a girl has to ask.. did you..?" She tilted her head at me.

K: "We did. Cherry Cotton Candy, with a hint of bubblegum." I smirked a little. "I couldn't get enough of the taste.." I nodded to Havoc.

Havoc: *Bro'ish snicker* "I getcha! I getcha!" He flopped a foreleg over my shoulder. "Was she wild?"

K: "Nah.. very tame. Very tender. Squishy, soft.. loving." I sighed. "She would have made some stallion very, very happy." I lowered my head. "She asked me to raise Spunky."

Katrina: "I can't think of a better father." She gave me a one-arm hug.

K: "Thanks, Kat." I smiled a bit. "You know, speaking of asking.." I looked at her over the rim of my glasses. "..ever since that one night, we never have.." I gestured a little. "Something I need to know?"

Katrina: "Ahh.. well, I'm very, very straight, K----. Applejack.. ohh.. made some very suggestive offers, but I'm not into girls at all. Not like that." She shrugged. "Not that she didn't give me permission, just, we haven't had a moment where it's been you, me, and no one else."

K: "Huh! You know, I never thought about that - the fact that you're straight, and straightness combined with conservative ideals towards sex, were the prevailing culture of the day in my world around Gen One.. and.. in 2012? Much more permissive, with much more experimentation and openness towards same-gender pairings, and casual sex." I shrugged. "It makes me wonder if the 'connection' between realms has something to do with cultural energy?"

Havoc: "Way above my pay grade." He shook his head.

K: "Coffee." I took an offered cup. "You know everyone here is dead." I simply stated.

Havoc: "I.." He lowered his head. "Arooster County all over again?"

K: "Yeah, and Celestia knows it, she just won't admit it. I'm pretty sure, after they extracted them, the Porcines and others were given the corpses as foodstuffs." I shook my head, slowly. "Goat is good eating." I said, numbly.

Havoc: "..never had that, but.." He looked towards an abandoned stuffed bird sitting next to an empty house. "..killing the Kids, too.."

K: "Barbaric. These are sapient life forms." I scratched behind his ear. "You.. just don't kill children. Used to be women AND children, but at least in my world, such gender roles are being challenged - women want truly equal consideration, and I suppose that means equal status with men in mass execution considerations. Just.. not the kids."

Katrina: "Honestly, this world is mostly matriarchal." She shrugged. "Even the Canids, to an extent."

Havoc: "Yeah. I may be head of the household, but Bella runs the home. We're.. a team. But out there, on the field, it's down to competency, not gender." He sipped his coffee as well.

Lightning Strike came up at that point.

(And my damndest apologies to whomever made her [her?], I neither have your Art nor your Character Info any more, so I'm making guesses here)

She was a sharp-tinted, yellow mare with flowing light blue locks that were sort of spiky, like the edges of Dash's hair. Very athletic, she was an Earth Pony. Almost two years ago, she'd taken over as a Platoon Commander in the old 15th Royal Infantry, after Chowsin Ridge. Now, she commanded the 1st Royal Army Company.

Capt. Lightning Strike: "General. Been a while." She nodded.

K: "Yeah, Strike, it has." I nodded to her. "I'm sorry we didn't get better acquainted."

Strike: "It's fine, sir. I understand." She sat next to Katrina. "Pinkie was.. very special."

K: "Is." I corrected. "She's still alive, she's just left." I shrugged.

Strike: "Yes, sir." She said, softly. "Still. I'm.. I'm going to miss her cakes!" She chuckle-sniffled. "She always had a surprise in them. Why, I remember, one time, she put a whole spinning top inside. My little brother played with it for ages.. I think he still has it." She shook her head, softly.

K: "She is special." I nodded.

People started waking up, and Katrina - ever the loyal one - enlarged the fire so it could be used for cooking breakfast. We had several thousand ponies with us that would soon need a meal.. the Logistics troops, the Prench Civil Engineers, all started doing the same. After about an hour, even Celestia woke up, and came over to our camp fire - by then, all the girls were there, too.

Celestia: "Toola Roola." She nudged her.

Toola: "Yes, ma'am?" She looked up, with a small smile.

Celestia: "She chose you. I approve." She nuzzled her.

Toola: "Th.. thank you.." She sniffled.

Applejack: "Aw, shucks, everyone! Pinkie ain't dead! Why, she done got stronger'n any of us! We should be proud! Happy!" She got up under my right arm.

K: "Yes. For her, the War is over, and she can have a party any time she wants." I nodded slowly. "It's what she always dreamed of."

But, the war was front-and-center for us. We had to keep punching, until Tirek was dead, and the peace that afforded, would allow us to party any time WE wanted.

After all, that's what Pinkie wanted, too.

Part 2: Empty Hearth

TIME: 13:22 IT
DATE: War Day 764/8 Quintillius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Artesa de Segre, Navarre


Duke Alfonso: "And you are certain this is what happened?" He spoke in low tones.

Only the direct witnesses to Arooster County were in the tent with us, with Derpy's team pulling security around it - this was still a state secret.

K: "Discord was many things, but he wasn't a killer. Not.. not like this. He wouldn't have killed these people, or banished them. The only conclusion, given that there's zero evidence of them running for the hills or anything else, is that Tirek extracted the rainbow from these people, in situ, then let his forces carry away the bodies for food - in my world, some cultures intentionally raise non-sapient goats for their milk, meat, and fur." I shrugged. "My grandmother on my father's side.. came from one such culture - I've eaten goat. And pony."

Duke Condor: "What does this mean?" He rubbed his chin with his off-hoof.

K: "That.. sadly.. everything there ever was about these people, is gone. Their souls were destroyed in the extraction process. If they've been eaten.. I don't even think the Porcines would leave but fragments of bones behind." I lowered myself onto a rock. "They're gone. Completely gone. We won't even know their names. All we have is this empty husk of a town." I looked up at them. "But.."

Duke Condor: "Si, Mariscal?" He swished his horns a tad.

K: "..that also means we have a new base of operations. With no civilians to worry about feeding, arming, or supplying, we can use Artesa de Segre as your army's main headquarters. If anyone asks, you say that Tirek murdered everyone before you got here, and ate their remains. The people have seen plenty of his brutality, they'll belive it. But, don't tell them The Rainbow was extracted from them.. don't.. don't burden them with that nightmare."

Duke Alfonso: "He is right, Cousin." He put a hoof on Condor's shoulder. "The people must never know. It.. it would harm them." That meant more than the words.

Duke Condor: "I agree." He nodded, solemnly. "What is our next step, then, Mariscal?"

K: "Adapt the plan. With the extra troops, we branch in two directions at once. South, and West." I indicated the roads. "The Germane 1st Brigade will be here tomorrow, and the rest of the Prench 1st Brigade will be with them. We have three Brigades. Begin by seizing all the nearby villages - here, here, and here." I pointed on the map. "Call to Arms. Every goat that can march." I nodded. "Then, we give them enough training to get the job done. We advance on Balaguer. We use the international brigades to cordon off the area. Your troops in the vanguard, take the town. My troops prevent anyone from reaching you. The victory will be yours." I nodded to them. "And just to ensure that, I'll have Forest Spirit ride with you, while I command the International Brigades. You need advice? Ask him."

Duke Condor: "So.. even though you vastly outnumber us, now.. we take the initative. You support. Si?" He swished his horns a bit.

K: "Exactly." I nodded slowly. "The people will see your troops, and you, as their saviors. We'll be in the background. After we take Balaguer, we advance on Llieda, changing the plan a bit. Once you take Llieda, we stop, hold, train again, then split into two forces - my best troops with your greenest, take Huesca. Your best troops and my greenest, take Zaragoza. Zaragoza will still be the lynchpin, and I know, our toughest fight." I looked at them. "The 4th Battalion will be there, guaranteed."

Duke Condor: "This makes sense. Who shall command at Huesca?" He meant, of his faction.

K: "Captain Espinoza or Ensign Montenegro - and I would have her promoted to Captain if you pick her." I gestured. "I would suggest Ms. Montenegro - Captain Espinoza's father commands the 4th Battlaion, she knows him, and may have valuable insight." I shrugged. "I'll send Forest Spirit to command at Huesca, so I can focus my specialist forces at Zaragoza. Guaranteed, if Tirek has any more surprises, they'll be at Zaragoza."

Duke Alfonso: "And once again, our forces at the forefront, will get the credit?" He tilted his head.

K: "As much as possible, though the International Brigades will likely have to take the front line as well, to take and hold ground while your forces press the advance. As long as it looks like you're running the show, that's all that matters." I ran a finger over Zaragoza's spot on the map.

Duke Condor: "And what of the Capital?" He slid his hoof over Pamplona.

K: "That will be the final phase of the operation. Equestrian and Prench forces will advance from Bayonne, across the border, and block any exits from the north. Your 2nd Corps will move to block the east. Your 1st Corps will advance up from the south with the International Brigades, which will break off and hold the west. Your forces then take Pamplona." I tapped the map. "Only after we recruit everyone we can from Zaragoza and Huesca. I want your ranks swollen and full to bursting. I want your army to look mighty and impressive. So, when General Falco arrives.. you outnumber, outstyle, and outclass him at every turn." I dismissively waved across the map. "He'll have no choice but to bow to you.. and if he doesn't knuckle under immediately, I'll handle things." I smirked. "I'll politick him to death." And tapped them both on their shoulders.

Sacquet: "After you take Pamplona.. I think.. most factions will simply surrender. Especially if Falco folds into your ranks." He shrugged. "The war will mostly be over at that point." He nodded. "You can then send smaller units, publicly working with the Internationals, to sweep and clear any pockets, or to accept surrenders."

K: "Then we take the big choice, head on." I nodded to them both.

Duke Condor: "Si." He looked at his cousin.

Duke Alfonso: "Indeed." He looked back.

K: "I have some ideas on how to settle that, too, but we'll hold off until the campaign is over." I patted them both on the shoulders. "For now, with your permission, I'm going to grab Captain Espinoza and a few troops, and go have a look at one of the nearby villages."

Duke Alfonso: "Si, Mariscal." He smiled and nodded. "Stay safe."

K: "Always." I headed out of the tent at that point.

I made my way over to where the girls were, and they were all talking about Pinkie. Time to get their head back in the game. It's what she would have wanted.

K: "Girls. We're going to check out a few nearby villages with Captain Espinoza." I looked at Firecracker Burst and Lightning Strike. "You two as well." I pointed at them. "Full field packs - honey, get mine, please? I'll go get Captain Espinoza."

AJ: "Raight, hun." She nodded, and the girls went about assembling their things.

Captain Espinoza was drilling Corporal Garcia's platoon carefully, in her quest to make her assigned unit as elite as the 4th Battalion.

K: "Captain." I came up to her. "We're adapting the plan, with the recent magical battle here."

Captain Espinoza: "Is it true that one of the Elements is dead?" She got right to it.

K: "No, it's not. Pinkie Pie sacrificed her mortality to stop Discord from harming us - Discord was a dark chaos entity with a lot of drama baggage, hang-ups, and a thing for Princess Celestia, and dislike of me. He was going to harm us, maybe even render our entire side of the civil war, impotent and useless. Pinkie prevented that. However, Pinkie also passed the mantle of the Element of Laughter on to Toola Roola." I nodded to them all. "Corporal Garcia."

Garcia: "Mariscal!" He smiled a bit. "It was very brave of her to do this for us!"

Maria: "Si. We should remember her." She sighed.

Her uncle gave her that glare again - I had a feeling, his dear niece was as much hunting for a husband, as the enemy. I was not.. not at all interested.

K: "Captain, we're going to scout around some of the local villages and see what's up, and take in any recruits we can get. I need someone that speaks Navarese better than me, that can translate." I nodded to her.

Capt. Espinoza: "Take Corporal Garcia." She patted him on the shoulder.

K: "I'd rather take someone with some seniority.." I cocked a brow at her.

Capt. Espinoza: "Fine. Take -Sergeant- Garcia." She smirked, and dug around in her saddle bags, coming out with the 'Sargento' stripes the Navarese were using.

For reference, this isn't like the United States or similar militaries, where 'Corporal' and 'Sergeant' are immediately next to each other - the rank of 'Cabo' (Corporal) was OR-4 on the NEIGHTO rank chart, but 'Sargento' was OR-8, or, equal to an Equestrian Army and Marines Master Sergeant. It was close to the Spanish military in this way. Garcia just received a sizable promotion.

Garcia: "Thank you, Captain!" He bowed respectfully, as he took the stripes from her. "Let me sew these on, and we shall get ready, Mariscal!" And with that, his team moved off.

K: "I wanted YOU, Captain." I said, staring at Garcia's team as they departed.

Capt. Espinoza: "Si. But, you don't need me. Just a translator. I'm more valuable here, training, while we have time." She nodded just a bit. "My father will be brutal, when we engage him."

K: "Think he'll kill you without remorse? Soldier's duty and all that?" I looked at her.

Capt. Espinoza: "Si. No mercy. I am his daughter, but he sees me as a traitor to him, now." She sighed.

K: "Alright. I'll trust your judgment." I nodded to her, and departed to go get my gear.

I was very glad, I had such talented people to work with. This war was brutal, but having good leaders means less casualties.. I only hoped the surrounding villages were intact.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Iberian Village People

TIME: 15:44 IT
DATE: War Day 764/8 Quintillius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Approaching Alentorn, Navarre

Sergeant Garcia, his niece Maria, his son Diego (now Corporal), me, the girls, Lt. Firecracker Burst, and Captain Lightning Strike, were nearing the smaller village of Alentorn. We could see signs of a struggle, immediately..

K: "Looks like there was a fight.. everyone spread out." I fanned my arm out, and got down low.

Rarity: "Sniper deployed." She was on her belly, looking down the scope of her 9x48mm Super Sherman. "I see movement, farmhouse, right."

K: "Garcia. Get some better cover and call out to them - I don't want to get shot by people loyal to the King." I nodded to him.

Sgt. Garcia: "Si.. si.." He scooted behind a large rock. "Oye, por allá! Venimos en nombre del Rey Alfonso!" He yelled at the top of his lungs.

Man has some lungs, at that.

Farmer Goat: "Rey Alfonso?" He called back from his farm house. "A qué rey Alfonso te refieres?"

Sgt. Garcia: "El octavo!"

Farmer Goat: "Acérquense, señores, pero permanezcan relajados." He called back to us.

K: "Okay. Hands and hooves where he can see them, no sudden moves." I looked to Garcia. "I caught part of that. Stay relaxed? Something like that?"

Sgt. Garcia: "Si, senor Mariscal." He smirked.

We stood up and approached the farm house with our weapons slack on their slings or across our backs. The farmer met us partway across his field. Of course, I immediately drew his attention. He was armed with a Navarese copy of the Sagebrush shotgun - but, oddly, a single barrel design, not double.

Farmer: "Senor." He nodded to me, then looked at Sergeant Garcia. "Humano?"

Sgt. Garcia: "Si. Quién es tu líder?" He asked gesturing with his snout towards the town.

Farmer: "Senor Olonzoa." He nodded slowly. "Sígueme! Vamos!"

We followed behind him, soon arriving at a large stone building that, to me, seemed to either be a large oven building for mass bread baking, or a kiln building for making bricks. Either way, it was fairly low to the ground, constructed of brick, and now sported sandbags.

Farmer: "Senor Olonzoa!" He called.

A tall, somewhat refined goat exited the structure with a pistol on his hip - it was another Navarese imitation or copy of one of my designs. In this case, the original Custer in 10mm Pony Express.

Olonzoa: "Greetings, senors, senoritas." He nodded to us.

Applejack: "That'd be senora, sir." She bowed gently, and threw a leg around my hip. "This here's mah husband, Marshal K."

K: "I'm.. Field Marshal K, of Equestria." I nodded to him. "This is Sergeant Garcia of the Army of the Throne of King Alfonso VIII."

Garcia: "Si, senor." He nodded to Olonzoa with a grin. "We have come on behalf of the Throne to ask if your village can spare any goats for the cause? We have-"

Olonzoa: "While.." He cut him off. "..this village supports His Royal Highness, we have no goats to spare. I'm sorry. We suffer indignations at the hooves of some local rabble calling themselves soldiers of the Herdiet cause, but they are just banditos." He shook his head. "I'm terribly sorry, Sergeant."

Garcia: "Then we will kill these Banditos!" He snorted.

Olonzoa: "Truly?" He seemed surprsied. "The King's Army hasn't had this kind of ability before." He looked at me with suspicion.

Garcia: "We have the support of Equestria and NEIGHTO - an alliance of nations including Canida, Germaneigh, Prance, Roam, Poleland, and even Neighpon!" He chortled. "They give us guns, ammunitions, food, uniforms.. training, si.. so we may retake our homes and end this terrible war." He gestured to me. "I had.. invited the Field Marshal as a guest, you see? He was most curious to see if village goats were like village ponies! Yes, yes."

Garcia was lying through his teeth, but he was doing a good job of it. He was probably a very morally just man, but a very good fast talker and slick dealer when he had to be. He was 51, so, I imagine it was a mis-spent youth. Olonzoa, however, was placated.. and, judging by his reaction, fooled. I played along.

K: "My wife insisted on coming with - as did our friends." I shrugged. "It is dangerous, but less so with friends."

Rarity: "I've always wanted to see the beautiful Navarese countryside.. and as Sergeant Garcia had a mission.. we thought, why not go with? See what Sergeant Garcia is so fiercely fighting for." She batted her eyes at Olonzoa.

Olonzoa: "I.. I see!" He blinked. "Ah. Well. How can I refuse, then?" He shrugged. "The Banditos make camp about three kilometers from here.. to the east, there is a break in the hills, and some caves. That is their suppsoed headquarters." He pointed with his right hoof.

Garcia: "Then, we shall go! Come, amigos!" And, just like that, he started heading off, and we followed. Once we were out of earshot, however.. "Mariscal.. I trust you to lead us." He looked back at Olonzoa, who was now talking with the farmer. "He is slick, that one. I do not think we will get much help, here."

K: "None the less, we have to eliminate them or take them prisoner." I shrugged. "If the Throne is to regain the trust of the people, all acts of kindness, great and small, must be done to restore its reputation."

Twilight: "K's right." She looked at Garcia as we marched. "This whole Civil War is an indictment of the Throne's authority - if the people are ever going to trust that authority again, we have to show them we're the best choice. That means doing everything from stopping bandits to handing out food."

Strike: "Besides. You three need some combat experience. Oliana wasn't much in the way of fighting." She nodded.

Burst: "Don't worry, Sergeant, you got this." She cheered him on.

Garcia: "With friends like these, how can we lose?" He chortled.

K: "Alright, let's go have a look." I nodded. "Everyone spread out."

We moved along the terrain in the rough direction indicated, and eventually found the depression in the terrain that Olonzoa talked about. It was pretty easy to figure out - it was a natural pasture, with a small stream, several caves..

..and a dozen machine gun emplacements, two artillery pieces, a Kyangese A7V-style tank, and about four entire regiments of soldiers.

AJ: *Hushed whisper* "Why that lyin', double-crossin'-"

I grabbed the radio.

K: C> "Alpha to Cognac, Hunter, and Romeo One and Two Actuals." I needed bigger guns and more guns.

Sacquet: C> "Cognac Actual responding for all parties." He had that sound in his voice - he knew we stepped into it.

K: C> "Watch for flare. Bring all callsigns indicated. Begin heading north-north east, flare to follow, best possible speed. Arm for anti-tank. Alpha Actual to Thunder."

Cosmic: C> "Thunder Actual. Go."

K: C> "Enemy troops in the open.." I pulled out my map. "..maximum range settings on all guns." They were at the edge of the artillery's firing range, we'd actually be Danger Close. "Grid Square co-ordinates Alpha-Two Four by.. Juliet Two-Three. Continuous barrage, fifty rounds, HE, Danger Close. NOW!"

Cosmic: C> "Understood! ETA two minutes. Thunder, out."

K: "Heads down! Rounds incoming!" I scooted us back over the small rise, and as we turned to make a retreat, a squad of enemy soldiers rose over the crest of the roadway, coming from the town. "FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!"

We opened up first, with Firecracker launching off a string of Bottle Rocket spells that hissed into the air like a mini-MLRS, while Twilight slammed her Merrill to the ground, and started hosing down the enemy. Lightning Strike came in as her AMG, and started feeding the belt.

Garcia and his troops rolled over to some rocks for cover, and started firing. Maria was one of his marksgoats, and she picked off the first two in the line as the machine gun started hitting the group, and the rockets impacted.

I whipped back over the rise, seeing the enemy scurrying about like ants, and primed my Gavin, aiming for the A7V's vision blocks, I fired an impact fuse grenade, striking a bit low, but blowing open a hole, and clearly killing the driver. I then hosed down the area with no aim at all, just thirty rounds on full automatic. Fluttershy and Toola joined in, forcing the enemy to take cover.

We ducked back and reloaded, as the second enemy squad in the platoon advanced over the field from town, joined by several members of the town's militia.

This is where the Civil War got uncivil.

I flopped over and got on my belly, targeting the farmer with the shotgun, and putting one round in his head, at the apex of his horns, blowing the back of his skull out. Olonzoa and the others went to ground, and started firing back at us.

K: "RAIRTY!" I pointed towards Olonoza.

Rarity: "Mine!" She lasered in on Olonzoa, and put a round through his right eye, sending brain matter all over two soldiers behind him.

I reloaded my Gavin with a Timed Fuse shell, and fired at the cluster - they didn't spread out when they went to ground - and I managed to land it right between them all, the shell detonating alongside one of the other townsfolk, and blowing her in half.. she was still screaming, as were three others. I put a round in her neck and another in her chest from 120 meters, and she was still after that.

K: "GET UP! GET UP! MAKE A BREAK FOR THE TOWN! NOW! SHELLS INCOMING, ONE MINUTE!" I yelled as I got up on my two feet, and started running. I didn't need to look back, I could hear their hooves behind me.

We made it to the edge of the village, by the Farmhouse, and we all pitched ourselves into the windows, as the screech of artillery shells came overhead.

I rose up, seeing a goat advance on me with a rolling pin. As I was about to fire, Applejack put three shells into her with her Chaffee, and bashed her aside. We made for the windows on the other side of the farm house, just as the shells started landing.

On the other side, most of the town's militia was forming up, still.. but they saw us open the shutters, and started spreading out, and firing on the house. Fortunately, old world construction, this was brick and mortar with a cement-like outer coating. We had cover, not just concealment, and we started returning fire.

K: "FIRECRACKER! Get to the roof and fire off a Magic Flare! We need our reinforcements!"

Burst: "Yes, SIR!" She scampered up the stairs, rifle ready, and I could hear her fire half a mag. "CLEAR up here! Flare OUT!"

I knew Sacquet would be here, soon.. we just needed to hold out, outnumbered about 50 to 1.

Part 3: Battle of Alentorn

TIME: 16:00 IT
DATE: War Day 764/8 Quintillius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Alentorn, Navarre

K: "Keep firing!" I said, trying to make precise shots. "Try to conserve ammo!"

Dash: "Frag out!" She hucked one of our snout grenades, landing it right by an overturned cart.

The cart flipped over in the explosion, and five goats fell over. One got back up, stunned, gushing blood from five serious wounds. He tried to walk away.. slowed, staggered, and went down.

Diego: "PAPA!" He.. I just realized he was on the floor, curled up in the fetal position. Crying.

K: "Demetrio.." I said in a soft voice, tapping him on the shoulder.

He went over to Diego, and pulled him up.

Garcia: "Are you leaking, my son!?" He checked him over, no blood.

Diego: "No! No.. PAPA! No puedo hacer esto, papa! No puedo! Estoy aterrado!!! Hay tanta sangre. Yo no quiero morir!! Quiero mami! MAMI!!" He sobbed.

Twilight: "Is he okay?!" She called back, as her horn sent magic sparks down on the enemy.

K: "He's mentally broken! DEMETRIO! TIE HIM UP! So he doesn't try to run and get cut down! Then get back here, and bring us his mags!" I called back to him.

Garcia: "SI!" He got a rope out, and tied a sobbing Diego down to the stove, grabbed his rifle and musette bag with spare mags, and slammed himself just below the window I was at. "Haha.. this is a good fight, Mariscal!" He passed me a mag, as I was starting to reload, ducking down.

K: "A good fight.." I looked back at Diego a moment. "..you need to send him home after this. He can't fight. He just can't do it." I shook my head.

Garcia: "Si.. si.." he shook his head a moment. "..I did not think my son could kill and fight like this, but he insist.. he say.. someone have to keep you alive, old man." He grinned at me a little. "He make it this far. I am not ashamed."

K: "Fluttershy, Applejack, Toola, with me, opposite side. Twilight, maintain fire here. Rarity, get up top with Maria and get a better sniping position. Garcia, stay here with Twilight, kill them or keep their heads down." I gestured.

Garcia: "Si!" He patted me on the shoulder.

He has that same lust for danger that Admiral Saletine once had.. that same old man's confidence. I liked that about him.

I moved over to the far side of the building - really, it was all one big room, we were in - as Rarity and Maria got upstairs. The artillery shells were landing, now, and I could see they were hitting in the general area of the hollow we'd nearly walked right into. There were a LOT more off-targets than usual, a much wider pattern, and I knew that wasn't Cosmic's fault. Still, about one whole company managed to make it up the slope we'd been at, with shells mainly landing behind them, and started advancing over the 150-or-so meters towards the farm house.

K: "Get ready." I stated, and braced my rifle.

Toola: "Our friends better get here, soon." She stated, at the window next to me.

K: "Hun, wait until they get within 50 meters and give them a full tube." I nodded. "Flutters, you and me, pick your shots. Toola, wait until they're within 100 meters. Once they're in greande throwing range, you and AJ give 'em everything you've got."

Fluttershy: "Right."

AJ: "Yew got it, hun."

Toola: "Of course!"

I took my grenades off my vest, and handed two to my wife, and one to Toola. Fluttershy did the reverse. I still had four Gavin grenades on me. Fluttershy had a plain Bradley.

Fluttershy and I opened up on them. Picking shots, we fired as fast as we could, ignoring the return fire. Shots hit around us, or went through the house. We both did our best to minimize our profiles. Fluttershy was focusing on the attempts made to roll up a KDP-71 on a wheeled mount. Every time a Goat tried to get near it, she took him. I was suppressing any goat that got up.

I reloaded.. and realized I only had one spare mag after this. I got my radio out.

K: C> "Alpha to Cognac - ETA? Shelling is just about over." I said, calmly.

Sacquet: C> "This is Cognac - if you are in that big house, we're almost there, at the other end of town.. one moment.." There was a pause. "..we call you back. Customers."

K: "Sacquet's cut off!" I called to them. C> "Alpha to Hunter!"

Havoc: C> "This is Hunter, we're not doing much better! Major enemy formation encountered at the edge of the road, by the cliffs! We're dug in, but it's a stalemate - there's no cover, no room to maneuver! Hunter Actual, out!"

K: "So's Havoc!" I frustratedly reported. C> "Alpha to Romeo One or Romeo Two!"

Typhoon Surge: C> "Romeo Two-Two! We're halted at the south end of town - the whole town's fighting back, suh! We'll get back to you!"

K: "No help! Second floor! Everyone go!" I pointed. "Demetrio! Get your boy!" C> "Alpha to Whiskey One-One Actual!"

Spitfire: C> "Whiskey One-One, go ahead!"

K: C> "Alpha is beseiged at the large farmhouse on the east end of town! All QRF are pinned down! Request extraction under fire! Use the chairs!" We hadn't even PRACTISED this.. this was just a theory..

Spitfire: C> "Whiskey on the way! Hang on!"

Applejack: "How we gettin' outta here!?" She took tail end charlie.. it didn't take the enemy long to realize fire had slacked on the first floor.

K: "We're going to try the MARCh!" I called back, as we go to the second floor.

The MARCh - or Master Airborne Recovery Chair - was based on a very similar system from my Earth. It consisted of several rows of chairs, welded to a frame, with a large inverted Y-shaped metal arch that stretched about 12 feet above it. The idea is, the unit gets strapped into the chairs and can still fire at the enemy. An aircraft - or multiple ponies from Transport or Bomber Command - flies overhead and hovers just long enough to hook the arch, then flies away as fast as possible.

We had one prototype made, and I'd brought it with, specifically because I thought I might need it. I didn't think it'd be for this, though. All F/A-1 Falcons had a hook on the underbelly that could be used for this system, as well as a few other emergency cargo systems, since the Falcon had to be a fighter, bomber, and cargo helicopter at the same time.

Twilight: "K.. K! We haven't even TESTED it!" She protested, just as some stone flakes were blown away above her head, she leaned back and fired the rest of her belt at the goats entering the house from the windows.

Dash: "We can do it! I think!" She hucked a grenade down the stairs, standing side-by-side with AJ.

K: "ROOF!" I called, as we got to the central-front bedroom on the second floor.

Dash and AJ fired into the ceiling at the same time, shattering enough of it to make an opening.

AJ: "Ah'm coverin' ya!" She held the door, being the only one with much ammo left.

K: "Dash! Rope! Go!" C> "Alpha to Whiskey One-One, drop the MARCh on our flare! Prepare to extract!" I looked up fromth e mic. "Burst, get up there and get a flare fired!" I pointed as Dash got a rope down to us.

Twilight discarded her empty Merrill, using her horn magic to break the barrel. She was the first one up. Then Firecracker, then Demetrio got Diego up, then Fluttershy flew up, followed by Demetrio, then Rarity.

K: "Grenades!" I held my hand out for their remaining explosives. "AJ! Get ready!"

I recovered the grenades, and pushed AJ back towards the rope. I started pulling pins, and snapping open cylinders, then rolling them all down the stairs as fast as I could. Toola, Rarity, then Maria, then Lightning Strike. AJ and I were last.

K: "GO!" I ordered, and fired a Gavin timed fuse grenade down the stairs, followed by the rest of my magazine.

AJ: "I'm up! COME ON!" She yelled down to me.

I ran and just grabbed the rope. Everyone simply pulled me up, just as Spitfire, Gorcat, Soarin, and Gilda came overhead, hosing down the area with machine gunfire, each of them holding part of the MARCh. They just dropped it to the roof, and scattered in the skies to avoid ground fire.

K: "BUCKLE IN!" I ordered, helping Demetrio get Diego into one of the chairs. Demetrio got in next to him, and I was next to AJ one row back. C> "Alpha Actual - Ready to MARCh!" I pointed at the roof hole. "Everything you got left!"

I pulled the Type-34 SMG, letting my Bradley drop slack, aimed, and waited to see a head with horns. One popped up, and no less than ten guns shot it to pieces. An F/A-1 Falcon of the Prench Air Force came in overhead at that moment, and dropped its 45kg bombs all over the place, just trying to salvo its ordnance, so it could have the extra lifting and bouyancy to carry us.

I felt a VERY sharp smack in the frame, and we were away.. carried up into the sky by a Prench aerofighter. Below me, I could see our troops moving in on the town, including the Neighponese forces. Getting an aerial view, I realized we'd engaged a full Brigade of Communist-aligned, Khyangese-supplied troops, as well as almost the whole town's militia. Someone called for Artillery as we got further from the area, and I watched as the entire town was swallowed in billowy puffs of shell impacts.

We won. But, we had to destroy the town in order to save it. The irony was not lost on me.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Broken Village, Mended Fences

TIME: 18:47 IT
DATE: War Day 764/8 Quintillius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Ruins of Alentorn, Navarre

I stood over the broken frame of a cart, demolished in the closing artillery strike. Behind me, the shattered remains of the 1st Free Goats Brigade of the Democratic Republic of Navarre, were being led away as prisoners. Out of a total of 3272 enemy goats, only 107 remained. The village had been shelled into dust - 100% casualties.

Now, we were the war criminals.

K: "Duke Condor.. Duke Alfonso.." I sighed. "..I would understand if you want us to leave."

Duke Alfonso: "You did what had to be done. Yes, many civilians died here, but it seemed as though the responsible parties - the parents - cared not if their Kids were endangered."

Duke Condor: "What happened here is their fault, Mariscal. Not yours. You wanted their help - you did not realize they were the enemy. You had no idea this was the headquarters of the Kiangese faction." He shrugged. "Neither did we."

Duke Alfonso: "Moreover.." He nodded to his cousin. "Had you not done this, they would have been free to attack our rear areas, and take our towns from us. We left precious few defenders behind, in the name of ending the war as fast as possible."

K: "You're right. I know you are. But it won't erase the guilt I feel." I sighed.

Celestia: "This.. this is, again, why we continue to trust you." She put a wing around me.

Emperor no Ken: "Yes!" He nodded sharply. "Your first concern after freeing my capital, was de ponies dere dat were starving! Even before de battle, you gave dem your food!" He pawed the ground. "You worry more about everyone else than yourself, K."

Twilight: "You KNOW they're right." She shook her head as Fluttershy finished patching the small wound on her arm.

Applejack: "Don't feel so bad fer yerself, hun." She shrugged. "Useless words, ah know.." She trailed off.

I moved over and hugged her, with her hugging back. I wasn't going to let my wife be sad for me being sad.

A couple of hours later, we were in our quarters in Artesa, when Strike found us.

Lightning Strike: "General!" She stuck her head into the room.

I was relaxing in an overstuffed chair someone had found and stuck in my bedroom. Boots off, finally, and feet airing out. I did sleep in them, remember?

K: "Yes, Captain?"

Lyra was also here.. WITH her man.. and reading quietly to herself. A story book we'd found in Coltonville, actually. Gaze was dozing on the couch. Lyra was the only one I actually trusted to check my feet - no sense bothering Cody or Well with it, and AJ just didn't understand them like Lyra did.

Lightning paced over and stared at my feet like they were some alien creature.

Lyra: "Capt'n.." She raised her head. "Them's bare human feet." A little eye narrowing here, like, this is my territory, sister.

Strike: "Ah.. just.. I've never seen them before." She was comparing them to her back hooves. "Sorry, sir.. just.. something odd." She shrugged. "Sorry."

K: "No, no, it's fine." I flexed my toes and made pinchy-pinchy movements with my big toes. "Gizmonk feet are similar, but their toes are much longer and can almost be used as hands. Best I can do is pick up small objects with my toes. I get it - you've never seen anything like that before. Most of my past lovers have had some curiosity about them.. even Dr. Well Wishes thought they were strange. So, what can I help you with?"

Strike: "Ah! Ah, yes, the leader of the Kiangese-aligned faction has come to Artesa, and wants to meet with you. They have an advisor with him that says he knows you.." She trailed off, looking between her hooves and my toes again, before dismissing whatever thought was in her head.

K: "Haha! Kang again!" I grinned widely as Lyra levitated clean socks over and slid them on my feet. "Let me guess - ah.. Chairman Division Leader Kang, right?"

Strike: "Ah.. he calls himself Comrade Corps Leader Kang, but, yes." She shrugged.

K: "Get my staff, please. And treat him as an honored guest - see that he's comfortable, and get him some tea." I smirked.

Gaze: *Yawn* "Figgers it's him. Seems he wuz right 'boot gettin' that promoshun!" He smirked. "I'll get Norf an' Coz."


TIME: 21:07 IT

We were in what used to be the local Alcalde's house. Kang was sitting next to Forest Spirit, and the two were chatting like old frenemies. I just sat down in front of him.

Kang: "AH! General.." He looked at the girls. "Before anything political.. I must.." He lowered his head. "I have heard what Com-.. Friend Pinkie Pie did for all of us. I'm humbled. My thanks.. and.. condolences that we will not see her, possibly, ever again?" He shook his head.

K: "You don't hate us, Kang, I get it - you're passing respect to a former rival." I nodded.

Kang: "Yes." He nodded a little. "I regret to inform you, General, that you have virtually destroyed the Kiangese-backed faction, here. I convinced Comrade Rojas to surrender to you - I educated her on your graciousness in victory, and your equal grace in.. not defeat." A small smile.

K: "I hear you've been promoted to.. inspiring.. the comrades of an entire Corps, now." I, again, leaned in to that understatement humor common in Chinese culture.

Kang: "Indeed. Indeed." He looked at his tea a moment, then back up to me. "I know.. General.. what the future holds, now." He was concerned - very uncharacteristic of a Chinese person to address an adversary like this.

K: "Talk to me." I dropped the politicking and leaned forwards a bit.

Kang: "You humiliated the Herdiets, and my leaders are afraid of you. They are discussing plans to invade Equestria after you defeat Tirek." Oh.. shit.

K: "I.." I lowered my head. "..a lot of people would die." I looked back up. "Kang, you're committing treason!" I furrowed my brow a little. "Even telling me that-"

Kang: "It is because I do not want war, General." He set his teacup down.

K: "How can I help? And, call me K." I nodded to him.

Kang: "Just before you depart for Tirek's home lands, I will need.. some special assistance." He looked at the girls. "I am going to overthrow the Chairman."

K: "You're serious!" I was incredulous.

Applejack: "..I'll play Tartarus' advocate. How d'we know y'ain't lyin' to us, t'start somethin' with Equestria?" She raised her gaze a bit.

Kang: "Because I have not once lied to you." He nodded to her.

K: "He hasn't. Sure, we've danced political, but he's never once lied. Moreover, I understand his culture very well - he wouldn't say these things if he didn't trust us. Even if this is some kind of a trick, if I thought he was lying even a little bit, I'd raise a massive diplomatic stink about it, and everyone would see him as a traitor.. they couldn't bury that, they'd kill him." I slowly shook my head. "Spirit?"

Forest Spirit: "I agree with K." He nodded firmly. "What do you need from us, Kang?"

Kang: "I will know more what I require when the time draws nearer. Several people will have to be swiftly killed, and their deputies secured. I have the support of several senior military officers upset about how Keng Wan was treated, and who believe a war with Equestria would lead to atomic devastation." He nodded slowly. "Even with our great factories, our arms, our soldiers.. I know that you, if attacked at your weakest, would simply unleash those atomic devices on us, then send Lord Sombra to eat our souls if he has the strength left to do it." He sighed slowly.

K: "That's why you requested this assignment." I nodded. "And Cowrea. You knew the situation before I ever arrived - you wanted to see if I really could be trusted. The whole thing was a test."

Kang: "Indeed. I had to know the strength of your character. Both as a winner, and a loser." He said, also dropping the pretenses.

K: "How are we going to set this up?" I nodded to him.

Kang: "My interactions with you - especially in Cowrea - have given me political capital. They trust me, to an extent. On the eve of the invasion into Tirek's home land, I will propose we have a conference - a summit meeting - to extract a promise from NEIGHTO that they will not use their newfound powers to attack us. Purely for the public relations." He gestured. "That and we will frame the initial agreement as somewhat humiliating - something meant to embarass you."

K: "Which Chairman Lo would love to see." I nodded.

Kang: "Accept the invitation, despite the propaganda around it. Bring whom you need, whom you trust the most." He nodded slightly. "I am not completely certain how we will do what needs done, but I already imagine it will be fast, stealthy, and violent."

K: "And, of course, my staff will be expected to be unarmed." I shrugged. "At least at first. So, we help you overthrow the Chairman and the Triad, and then what?"

Kang: "I will assume the role of Chairman, and we will sign an accord. The Collective Khyangese Republic will pledge its forces to assist in Tirek's destruction." He smiled a bit. "Glory for us in a noble cause, and a good way to ensure a parity of casualties.."

K: "Meaning, if you get overthrown later - which you already suspect would happen - the eventual leader won't have a military with which to start a very tragic war. Very smart." I smirked. "And at the same time, you get to observe how we work." I shrugged. "Alright, Kang. I'm game for this."

Twilight: "If it means preventing the destruction of the world.." She sighed. "..you're going to let a lot of your soldiers die."

K: "Well.. they're casualties that would be suffered, anyway, Twilight. This just spreads them over a larger number of people, and ensures that Kianga takes casualties at a similar rate as NEIGHTO, also ensuring there's no serious disparity of power and force after Tirek is defeated." I looked at Forest Spirit. "I'm saying this right now - if I die, you become the next Field Marshal. You absolutely must be willing to pull the trigger on atomic warfare if it happens." I looked at Kang. "I have a feeling, Kang, your country may be working on them."

Kang: "I am not certain." He shrugged. "I cannot inquire too deeply. If I succeed, of course, we can see about possible mutual disarmament in the future."

K: "More than possible. No nukes. For anyone." I nodded.

Kang: "Agreed." He nodded back.

K: "Anything else, Kang?" I said, returning to the political.

Kang: "Ah.. well.. Comrade Rojas has surrendered.. I.. suppose the only thing is to ask for safe passage to my home country." He shrugged.

K: "You will be my personal guest. I'll arrange a Truck to take you to the Prench border, and then by my personal train to the closest point to the Kiangese border, and truck or air transport to the nearest border station." I reached my hand across the table.

We shook. And it was more than just a hand-and-hoof shake. In that quaint little home in Navarre, a pathway to actual lasting peace with the Kiangese was forged. We just had to be there at the right moment to see it through.

Perhaps that's what everyone meant when they said they still needed me? People like Kang, who respected me, and would broker deals with me, but no one else.
