December 21, 1011 C.S.
08:11AM, Canterlot Royal Time
Dusk's Apartment, Canterlot

Dusk was reading his text messages in bed. The fallout from the Charity Dinner attack was starting to settle into place. With Echo and six other guards dead, they were down a whole tactical team. Add to that, 17 other Nightwatch Guards had been 'replaced' by Changelings, and were in the hospital, recovering from having their love or life force or something, sucked out of them.

Never mind how bad Shining Armor had been treated, how he suffered.

The remaining Nightwatch had all been given leave or light duty while they reorganize.

Right now, accounting for injury and everything, Dusk was Acting Officer of the Day, so, he was busy fielding text messages. And relaxing. In his bed. Alone.

Trixie: "Dusk?" She leaned into the room, this time dressed in a proper T-Shirt and boyshorts.

Dusk: "Yeas, Trixie?" He finished replying to Evening Mist.

Trixie: "Ahh.. I still have that 600 bits I was given by Neon or whatever that thing was. Do I need to give it for evidence or something?" She made a pouty face.

Dusk: "..what 600 bits? Far as I know, that might've been stolen before the police processed your stuff for evidence." He said, now texting Greyskies Starburst, one of the standard Royal Guards.

Trixie: "YAY! Then I can pay for the pizza!" The door bell rang. "Perfect. The Great and Hungry Trixie doesn't need to bum off you, then." She scooted to the door.

Dusk listened in on the interaction.

Pizza Pony: "Presto Pizza! Two large pepperoni lover's and a Diet Dr. Hay. That'll be 43 Bits."

Trixie: "Here ya go, my good stallion."

Pizza Pony: "..hey, aren't you that magician from the Senators' Dinner? The one who's flash pans blinded everyone?"

Trixie: "Ah-er-well, that was sabotage! By the Terrorists!" She sounded defensive.

Pizza Pony: "Right. Well, hey, listen, here's my uncle's business card. His office is having a Hearthswarming Eve party. Talk to him - he needs entertainment. He was going to have something else, but they canceled."

Trixie: "OH! Thank YOU! Here, have a nice tip."

Pizza Pony: "Oh, thank YOU, m'lady! Enjoy your food!"

He head the door shut.

Dusk: "..this can only go horribly wrong." He chuckled to himself.

Trixie came back in with the pizza boxes, and the soda, and two cups. She set them all on the nightstand, pulled out two paper plates, and served them both up.

Trixie: "Remember the first time you took me out for pizza? We were 14." She smiled a bit.

Dusk: "No, no, I remember the pizza date from senior year, when you s-"

Trixie: "-ent you to the moon and back." She finished the sentence for him, then paused. "Why is it pizza seems to be the center of our food lives?"

Dusk: "It's easy and it's the most often delivered food." He shrugged, finishing his text messages. "That and we love pepperoni." He smirked. "Some of us, unsliced."

She hit him with a levitated pillow. Twice. He couldn't help but laugh.

Trixie: "So.. got anything on tonight?" She cocked a brow.

Dusk: "I have to go to HQ and file some paperwork." He shrugged.

Trixie: "Alright." She nodded. "At least have your breakfast."

They ate together, and they reminisced about their past. Trixie wasn't trying anything, but after they were nearly killed, and as Dusk learned, mere steps away from LITERAL NUCLEAR CATACLYSM.. they both had a renewed appreciation for life.

After eating, Dusk got dressed in his Class B uniform (formal dark "lunar" purple collared shirt, slacks, black shoes, peaked cap) and headed for the Nightwatch HQ.

09:33AM
Nightwatch Headquarters, Canterlot Palace

Once he got there, he noted the.. decreased activity. Almost everyone was off duty. There was also a large collection jar for the families of the fallen Guards. While the Princess made it clear she'd make sure their funerals were handled, Echo, for example, had been the bread winner of her family. Her husband was part time employed at the WaWa. Mainly so they could always have someone available to care for their foal.

Dusk paused, looking at the jar, thinking about Echo's foal. Chime. She was 5. He looked at the jar again. That could have been him. Six inches to the right. The shot played back in his head.

He reached into his pocket and pulled out his bitbag. He dropped in 30 bits. For now. Until payday.

Senior Guard Misty Stars (6th Tac): "Boss?" She looked up from the desk, hearing the bits clank in.

Dusk: "Misty." He nodded.. and leaned against the reception desk. "I still can't get over the fact that our first live fire mission was so horrible." He shrugged. "Now, looking at the jar..." He sighed. "How did Bushel take it?"

Misty: "N-not well.." She looked down. "..he's going to move back to Texas to be with his family." She shrugged. "He.. ah.. he was in here earlier. He wasn't happy." And she let out a long sigh. "Was it our fault, boss?" She shook her head. "Did we mess up that bad?"

Dusk: "We did as we were trained." He shrugged. "We're trained well, but.." He slowly shook his head. "Actually shooting someone is a lot different than shooting targets. Paper doesn't shoot back. Paper doesn't breathe." He gestured. "Plus, we had the deck stacked against us. We know the fake Shining sent away TAC 4, made sure only three teams were there, and probably told the bad guys our exact plans." He gave a palms-out shrug, very slowly. "Truth is, the game was rigged from the start. But, in the end, we won."

Misty: "YOU won." She pointed out. "You were the one Stallion that decided this was bullshit, and challenged what was happening."

Dusk: "Yeah, which they counted on." He pointed at her.

Misty: "It doesn't change the fact that you beat them, sir." She nodded, firmly.

Dusk: "I suppose not." He nodded a little at her.

Dr. Fluttershy: "And, now, you all need to be very careful you don't fall victim to Survivor's Guilt." She paced in from one of the offices, and presented herself.

She was a short Pegasus mare, yellow coated, with a pink mane. It was clear from her proportions that she wasn't skipping meals. She was dressed in a softer sort of suit - dark tan pencil skirt, black nylons, black flats, black turtleneck, and a tweed sport coat. She also had half moon glasses on, and a decoration in her hair.

Dr. Fluttershy: "I'm Doctor Fluttershy. I was hired to give everyone a psychological exam and counseling." She held a clipboard in front of her generous bosom, and stuck out her hand a bit timidly.

Dusk: "Subaltern Dusk Seeker." He shook hands with her. "I think I'll pass for now." He shrugged a bit.

Dr. Fluttershy: "The exam.. ahm.. I'm sorry, but it's being required. I-I can give you.. some time.. if you'd rather, but.." She didn't like confrontation, this was clear.

Dusk: "Alright.." *Sigh* "..after the holidays, though." He shrugged. "After the funerals."

Dr. Fluttershy: "O-oh.. th-that's not what I meant.." She hid behind her clipboard. "I mean, I can give you until after lunch."

Dusk: "You're sweet." He shrugged. "But, no. I don't want to be mean to you, you're a very nice person, but I do not want anyone in my head right now." He glanced from side to side. "Who's order was it, Misty?"

Misty: "Ah.." She scratched the back of her head. "..Defense Minister Ironbottom."

Dusk: "And what's the threat?" He blinked.

Misty: "Disciplinary action." She shrugged. "He wasn't specific."

Dusk: "I see. Well, I'll lodge a formal complaint, and if I have to, I'll take leave until the 27th. I have leave time on my books." He looked at Dr. Fluttershy. "You do realize that this is the first time this has ever been an issue, right?" He was very sweet in his tone, speaking to her. "When I got this.." He fingered his scar. "..and we had four guards seriously injured in the Dragon Migration Incident in 1004, we weren't even offered a social worker. So, being told that I absolutely have to have a psychological exam with zero warning is.." He made a few gestures. "On the one hand, I find it an insult from Minister Ironbottom. On the other hand, I do appreciate the opportunity to bear my soul. On the third hand, I'm very afraid that these exams will not be used to help my Guards, but as a weapon to keep the good ones off the field, or worse, fire them."

Dr. Fluttershy: "I-I understand.. thank you for not being mad at me." She blushed a bit.

Dusk: "I could never be mad at someone as sweet as you - and that's just a straight compliment." He shrugged.


10:22AM
Dusk's Apartment

Trixie was on the phone with the one that needed entertainment.. the card given to her by the pizza boy. She'd been on the phone with Keepin Books, who was in charge of the entertainment committee for employees. There was a VERY well entrenched culture that one's workers were an investment, and things like office parties and year-end bonuses, and actual (legally guaranteed by contract) pension plans, were a thing.

Truly, once one got to be a salaryman or salarywoman in Equestria, one was well cared for by one's employers. The degree of care equal to the effort put in, and the prestige of the company. The highest end companies in the financial sector often gave whole cars to incoming senior level employees as a promotion bonus. Not a company car, a full personal vehicle.

Insurance was excellent, too.

This had been something Trixie had TRIED at one point, but she completely failed at being even a secretary. She had a bad habit of making bad coffee, forgetting appointments, and not filing things correctly or on time. She'd been fired from five offices across the country. One in just under a month. Personal record.

She's very happy as she hears..

Trixie: P> "800 bits? No problem."

Keepin Books: P> "AND whatever tips you get!"

Trixie: P> "What time?" She simply asked.

Keepin Books: P> "Eight thirty this evening. Drinks are free."

Trixie: P> "Sounds good, I'll be there." She looked at herself in the full length mirror and smiled.

Keepin Books: P> "We're really looking forward to this. Thank you, Miss Trixie."

He hung up first.

She immediately went for her costumes, and fidgeted around. Full cape and hat this time. Not just the singlet. Maybe a skirt, too? Mmm.. half-skirt, to cover the flanks. Heels? Mmm.. the kitten heels, with the wider heel base. This was an office, not a stage. She slipped the 'hard treads' on them, so they'd make a soft but distinct click when she walked.

Yes, this would work nicely. A simple Office Party, a few low end tricks for drunken salarymen and salarywomen, and a big finish.. and 800 bits would be hers. Plus, free booze. She made a mental note to only have a couple drinks, since she'd be alone.


11:07AM
Dusk's Office, Nightwatch Headquarters


Wispy Shadows: "..and I don't like it any more than you do, Dusk." She shrugged. "But we can't separate ourselves, make ourselves look like we're above questioning."

Dusk: "And what if these psych reports are used to throw people out of the Guard and Watch?" He shrugged. "Because they simply 'look off' or something."

Wispy Shadows: "I-" She frowned.

Dusk: "Don't tell me we aren't handing possible enemies, a sword, here." He pointed at her. "I don't have a problem with Watch or Guards getting mental health help, it's important, but I -do- have a problem with it being used as a weapon to get rid of good people for stupid or personal reasons that have nothing to do with their mental state. Like what fake Shining did? If they'd drawn out their plan, they could have used this as a way to get rid of me and other Guards before the attack. They could've done a lot more damage."

Wispy Shadows: "Okay, okay, you have a point." She shrugged. "What's YOUR proposal, then?"

Dusk: "Platoon and Team Leaders, then Chief of Personnel, then you. Any of them would and should have the authority to order a Guard or Watcher to take a psych exam.. I like Dr. Fluttershy, she doesn't have any ulterior motives that I can see. So, with her, multiple sessions. IF she sees a real red flag, then one of those on that chain of command can issue a suspension for medical reasons. Nothing more than that. And we see what Dr. Fluttershy says.. what treatment they need. And we take it from there, using the existing rules for injury and illness. Absolutely zero outside personnel or leaders, elected or appointed, save one of the Princesses, should have any say in this. We are the last line of defense - but this goes both ways. We are the last line for the kingdom, AND the princesses. We have to hold the line in either direction. If we get a bad government in office, bad leaders, whatever, we have a duty to arrest them if needed, to protect the kingdom and the people in it. And at the same time, we have a direct responsibility to defend our Regents if something happens. We can't do that if outside elements start prying a way in and opening us up to being weakened from within."

Wispy sat in his guest chair and sipped her coffee. She started thinking, holding up a finger to him, to give her a bit to ruminate on his words. Wise words. She knew it. The Changeling infiltration wasn't completely solved, was it? And what of other enemies in the future? Idealists that want the kingdom brought down?

Wispy Shadows: "..I agree. This is a fantastic idea." She nodded with a smile. "You're right. We owe it to both the Kingdom and the Princesses to remain ready, but we need to watch out for ourselves, too. That said, we can't just open ourselves up to someone that might want to weaken us from within." And shrugged. "Would you be offended if I offered Dr. Fluttershy a position as our official mental health expert?"

Dusk: "Great idea." He nodded. "She's a good person, and I trust her. She's so... pure and.. warm and wholesome."


1:24PM
Dusk's Apartment


Trixie was bathed and clothes were being carefully washed. She snacked on excess pizza as she got herself ready. She'd have a nap and make sure to have something solid on her stomach before leaving. Since she wanted to have, maybe, a little holiday punch or something, she didn't want it to be on an empty stomach.

She had seven hours before she needed to be there. Getting a ride.. well.. she'd just drive her car and park a bit away. Her beat-up Mercury Colt Park station wagon was not exactly a prime chariot for a fine magician such as herself..

No matter. She.. knew she shouldn't.. but she went and flopped in Dusk's bed. So warm, so cozy.. smelled like him.. she hugged his pillow. Smelled his stallion essence.. and despite herself, despite "knowing where she stood," she dozed off. Thinking things she absolutely should not.


6:27PM
Dusk's Apartment


Dusk finally got back home, and put his peaked cap on the hat rack. He was a bit wore out. Hammering out the independence of the Guard formations from the rest of the Equestrian services was important, and despite Shining Armor being laid up and unable to politically defend them, he had intentionally cashed in his chips hard won in saving the nation from nuclear cataclysm, to curry favor with Her Highness, Luna, to get his plan approved.

So goes his political influence. She did, however, say that he was speaking above his station with the inference that his promotion to Altern should proceed unhindered. That was a relief. He'd be confirmed on the new year, Wispy said, when the reorganization was complete. They also needed several new guards brought up from the standard Royal Guard ranks, and he'd have to take part in handling that as well.

He snatched a piece of pizza from the box, and went in to his bedroom, only to find Trixie snoring her head off, one of his pillows under her head, the other WEDGED between her legs.. deep between them.

He couldn't help but chuckle.

The alarm, set for 6:30, started buzzing almost as soon as he started getting his overshirt off.

Trixie: *Gurgle* "Mmhmhmmmmm.. oh, Dusk.. mmm.. harder.."

Dusk: "..wake up, Trixie. And, no." He laughed.

She shot straight up in bed, and looked freaked out, looked at him, looked at herself, and turned maroon.

Trixie: "OH GOSH!" She covered herself, but, she did have her T-shirt on, still. "Oh, noooo.." She whinnied. "..please leave a minute." She looked humiliated.

Dusk: "..I'll get a spare pillow. You.. you can keep that one." He cleared his throat and stepped out.

Trixie got stripped, went for a quick wash up.. that.. she wouldn't have needed if she hadn't decided to torment herself like this.. and got ready. Off came the hair net, some quick fixes of her strands, and some fast make-up. She was ready, and stepped out looking like a million Bits.

Dusk: "..I almost forgot how good you clean up." He smiled..

She smiled..

..they both looked away, awkwardly.

Trixie: "Give me a hand with the case?" She pointed to her magic items case.

Dusk: "Sure." He shrugged and rebuttoned his shirt (Uniform Regulations - since he hadn't stripped to Civvies, yet, if he left his apartment, his uniform had to be properly worn).

Grabbing her magic case, he followed her to her car. The poor thing needed work, he knew it, but it still ran. Even though it was 27 years old. It was built solid, back when things were made of steel and glass, not plastic. He loaded it in as she got in the driver's seat.

Trixie: "I'll be back by.. 10? Maybe. Don't feel you need to wait up." She shrugged.

Dusk: "No problem." He patted her head. "Knock 'em dead, kid."

Trixie: "Mmm.. the GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie shall amaze and mesmerize." She nodded, started the car, and took off.


7:14PM


Dusk was stripped down. PJ Pants, t-shirt, slippers. He was scanning Hayflix while texting Rarity. She had a show in the morning, so, she was going to bed. They did this - they texted constantly, when they weren't right next to each other. Cute ASCII emotes and everything.

There was a knock at the door, and he stretched, got up, and went to answer it. He had no idea it'd be-

Dusk: "GLIMMER?" He was surprised!

Starlight: "Very good, G-Man! We'll work on your name, next." She giggled, and walked in with a six-pack of single serve wine coolers. And Khyangese (Chinese) Take-Out.

She's wearing a black tanktop, plaid shirt, and short-shorts with Birkenstocks (sandals).

Dusk: "I told you before, I'm engaged. You MET Rarity." He shrugged.

Starlight: "Dinner's my treat, G-Man." She shrugged. "Besides, you said you'd be my friend." She set the goodies down, and kinda hugged herself. "I kinda need one right now." She looked down at the ground.

Dusk: "Okay.. but.. JUST friends." He wagged a finger.

Starlight: "Gotcha. No nudity." She smirked at him.

Dusk: "I mean it. You might be the girl that helped save the world with me, but - boobs." He blinked - she flashed him and he turned RED.

Starlight: "AHAHA!" She smiled. "Sorry.." She looked down at the ground. "You're just so cute about this stuff." And lowered her head. "I'll be honest, you're the first stallion in a while that's looked at me like that."

Dusk: "Er-Er.. well.. I can't imagine why." He was still blushing.

Starlight: "They remember my arrest and stuff, and they lose interest." She shrugged. "Besides, until then, I was saving myself for.." She hugged herself. "..I gave up on him. I'm not going to get him. He hates me." She sat on the couch.

Dusk: "Ah." He sat on the couch as well, but a bit away from her.

Starlight: "It's.." She sighed, frustratedly. "..it hasn't been easy. That whole thing was five years ago. I've been kinda.. just.. waiting for some stallion to really have a look at me. But.." She shook her head. "..heh, I even think to myself, part of the reason I'm nude at home is I keep hoping some handsome delivery stallion will come to the door and want to deliver a package." She grimaced. "That or just get a hug."

Celestia help him, she's literally touch-starved.

Dusk: "So.. you just wanted to vent? And have company?" He reassured her.

Starlight: "Yeah." She blinked.. trailing off.. "So, what's on Hayflix?"

Dusk: "I was about to watch-" She grabbed the remote.

Starlight: "You like Rom-Coms? I like Rom-Coms." She flicked over to 'All About Steve' and smiled a bit. "You'll love this one."

The rating is ONE star.

Dusk: "Er.. okay." He shrugged, and went for the Khyangese food.. at least she got some decent Beef-Broccoli..


8:24PM
Davenport Stationary & Stationery, Canterlot


As it turns out, the owner of the largest printing and stationery company in Canterlot was her employer this evening. They also sold sofas, strangely enough - and she spotted the floor model for the very sofa she'd been sleeping on, in one of the front windows.

She realized it wasn't cheap. 'Family Favorite since 980 C.S.!' Indeed, all this time, that crappy sofa... well, no it wasn't crappy, it was the sofa Dusk had since they were kids. It had seen everything, and withstood some zany things.. and several bouts of hip rotation that would have left lesser beds, reeling.

She smiled a bit. Maybe this would be a good gig? She parked around the corner and went to the rear entrance with her suitcase full of supplies. Magic time! She knocked.

Quill Davenport: "Yes? OH! You must be the entertainment." He gestured her to enter. "Please, come in." He smelled of good bourbon. "We.. ah.. kinda started a bit early." He shrugged. "Sorry. Drink?" He smiled at her.

Trixie: "Ahh... Trixie thinks that maybe Magic and Alcohol are not a good combination, sir." She was pleasant, and slightly aloof. "Maybe after."

Quill Davenport: "Oh, oh.. right." He shrugged. "Don't wan'ta fall. Ah.." He stuck out his hand. "Quill Davenport. I own the place."

He was a brownish-coated stallion with slightly darker brown hair that was seriously salted along the bottom - mid-50's or so. He was dressed in a standard cream office shirt, and black tie, with brownish slacks along the same color tone as the cream shirt, making them compliment each other. The tie was loosened. He didn't slur his words, but he was a bit "wobbly" in his gait, indicating he was a few sheets to the wind.

Trixie noted this and hoped this was the only issue here. 800 Bits is a lot of money.

She was led up to the main office space where all the other office partygoers were. Troublingly, she saw only stallions here. That made her raise a brow.

Quill Davenport: "You.. ahh.. you can use the supply room over there as your back stage, and the presentation stage to.. do your thing." He nodded. "We're all looking forwards to it." He grinned a bit.

Stallion #1: "She looks great, boss! This should be a REAL good show!" He laughed and giggled - very drunk.

Trixie: "Ah, yes. I'll.. just go get set up, then." She excused herself to the supply room - though, on the way, one of the stallions got a bit close and tried to grab her hips, only for her suitcase-fu to deflect it.

Great! Drunken salarymen. Just what she didn't need.

She got her most simple tricks ready, and a few flashy ones, but she discarded the idea of doing both the knife trick, and the "cold fire" trick - she was feeling like they might be unsafe in this environment.

She also texted Dusk.

{Text Message: Trixie (8:28)} - Drunk salarymen might need help okay for now tho

{Text Message: Dusk (8:32)} - be safe

{Text Message: Trixie (8:33)} - U got my back rite

{Text Message: Dusk (8:34)} - No prob. Text me in 30.

{Text Message: Trixie (8:35)} - U got it

And with that, she smirked at herself in he mirror, and stepped out, with a smaller magic bag in hand..

Trixie: "Alright, Gentlemen, prepare to meet the Great and Powerful Trrrrixie!"


9:12PM
Dusk's Apartment


Starlight: "..so good.." She was muttering under her breath. She was one of those that talked during movies, but in super quiet tones, to herself.

She was smiling. The main character was.. a lot like her. Desperate as fuck. Dusk was.. enduring this film, but his mind was elsewhere. He kept checking the time.

Starlight: "Something up, Dusk?" She finally piped up, pausing the film.

Dusk: "Trixie should've texted by now." He shrugged. "She was going to do some magic over at Davenport's office." He shrugged, and sent her a poke text again - he'd sent one at precisely 9:05 as well.

Starlight: "DAVENPORT?" She snorked, incredulously. "They wouldn't hire a magic act.. not for their infamous Hearthswarming Eve party." She shook her head. "I have a streetwalker regular that comes in the station a lot. High class, very pretty, but she's got miles on her." She shrugged. "She entertains there every so often. They don't hire magicians, or dancers, Dusk, they hire.. strippers and pros."

She didn't need to finish the sentence before he vaulted over the back of the couch, and ran to his bedroom. Light blue jeans, medium blue denim shirt, over his black tanktop. Leather jacket. For a heater, he couldn't carry his issued weapon - he instead grabbed his Colt .45 Longslide Automatic.

Trixie was in danger.

He grabbed his keys as he bolted for the door, texting Rarity as well.

{Text Message: Dusk (9:17)} - Trixie in trouble. Davenports office. Meet me.

{Text Message: Rarity (9:18)} - DAVENPORT??? IS SHE DUMB?? omw darling

Dusk: "YOU stay HERE." He pointed to her.

Starlight: "Alright.. alright.." She shrugged.

Fortunately, he hadn't had any of the wine coolers - he was stone sober. Down the stairs in a flash, he hit the button to unlock his car, the fumble and nervousness all over the place. Once again, he had to come save her. Into his car, and he drove off.


9:27PM
Davenport Stationary & Stationery


Dusk drove straight up to the front of the building. He got out, and stuck his .45 in his waist band behind his back. Drunken salarymen should be easy - the .45 was a last resort. He marched to the Personnel Door in the rear, and knocked. No answer. Rarity's car pulled up at the same time, and she got out.

Rarity: "Dusk, darling.. she's done it again, you know. Gotten herself in danger twice in one week." She frowned. "I suppose she didn't know.." She shrugged.

Rarity was dressed for this, more or less. Jeans, thick fur-trimmed medium tan coat that came to her waist. Underneath was a button-down in black.

Dusk: "I know." He shook his head, and rapped on the door again, even hitting the buzzer several times.

Rarity: "They aren't answering the knock. Shall we knock louder?" She had her own pistol, in her coat pocket, but she kept her hands free.

They could faintly hear yelling.. maybe chanting.. from inside.. and they couldn't hear Trixie at all.

Dusk grunted, and simply used his Telekinesis to "shove" at the very center of the door jam between the handle and the bolt, bending the sheet metal frame enough to dislodge the door knob latch. He then kicked it a little to open it.

They marched in, took an immediate right and followed the sign for 'Office' - up the stairs.

He could hear them laughing and carrying on. And.. Trixie shrieking.

They both picked up the pace. The .45 Longslide came out. He was going to be real mad if something bad happened to her.

They got to the office door, and Dusk had to force himself to stay in control. He still kicked the door in, just about shattering it by the door knob. He paced in, .45 aimed into the room in a two-hand grip.

He saw Trixie pinned down to one of the desks, with three guys holding her, and one of them trying to tear open her singlet. Davenport was between her legs, too.

He was also choking her with one hand.

She already had a swollen eye.

Trixie had fought back.

It was pretty clear what they were going to do.

The other men in the room didn't realize the seriousness of Dusk or his intrusion. They were still carrying on - chanting 'strip her, strip her.'

Dusk's head drown out the noise, and he focused on Davenport.

Dusk: "YOU LET HER GO RIGHT NOW!" He yelled at the top of his lungs.

Davenport pulled back, and as he did, he revealed how he'd managed to subdue her. He had a .32 caliber pocket pistol in his other hand, that HAD been at the side of her head furthest from Dusk's view point.

The second he saw the gun, he didn't hesitate. His .45 Longslide was raised, sights aligned center-of-mass, and he fired two rounds, then a third to Davenport's forehead. A perfect FTS Drill with all rounds down range in under 2 seconds. He fell immediately, backwards, knocking over one of his cohorts in the process.

Then, and only then, with Rarity drawing her own pistol, did everyone freeze. Trixie slid off the desk, and scurried along on her hands and knees, almost, to get behind Dusk.

Dusk: "Nightwatch. You're all under arrest." He said, through grit teeth, growling like a Griffon enraged.

Trixie: "D-Dusk.. R-Rarity.." She started bawling. "I'M SO SORRY!"

Rarity: "I shall summon your reinforcements, my darling." She said, one-handing her cell phone to dial 9-1-1.


10:37PM
Outside of Davenport's


Canterlot PD was there. So was Wispy. She was a little upset that Dusk had hotdogged this. Again. There was a dead civilian, and while it was a good shoot in the presence of a lethal threat, it was still an off-duty shooting.

Wispy: "Dusk.. you can't be making a habit of this. You're no one-stallion supercop police force." She frowned.

Dusk: "I know.. but... like.. I didn't want to just call the police and ruin things if they were just being rowdy. I didn't really think something was wrong until they refused to answer the door. The yelling? Yeah, I guessed right then and only then that Trixie was in serious danger." He shrugged. "I didn't want to have to wait for a patrol unit, delay things.. if she was in serious danger." He shook his head. "I mean, look, Chief, she was nearly.." He gestured. "..if I'd waited, she would have been."

Wispy: *Sigh* "You're right. You did more or less play this by the book. But, it's the second incident in under a week." She shrugged, open armed. "And I want you to see Dr. Fluttershy in the morning and talk about this, okay?"

Dusk: "Yeah.. I.. I kinda want to do that." He frowned. "Am I free to go?"

Wispy: "Yes. For now. I want you in the office bright and early, to do an incident report on this situation. Full, complete, and with all the contact info." She gently pointed to his chest. "We'll see if Canterlot PD can verify this was a regular thing, and see if there's maybe some more victims out there." She frowned. "Just.. be careful, Dusk."

The paramedic, Patch Plasters, came walking up to them at that time, nodding to Dusk.

Patch: "She wants to go home. She's refusing a hospital. There's no real signs of trauma, other than the bruise to her face. Vitals are good, and she checks negative for a possible TBI." He shrugged.

Dusk: "Thank you. I'll take her home." He nodded. "If you'll excuse me, ma'am." He nodded to Wispy.

Rarity was consoling Trixie. She was sobbing, seated in the back of the Ambulance.

The partygoers were all being herded into the back of a Detention Van. 17 arrests. This was going to be big news tomorrow.

Dusk looked at Trixie from a distance and sighed to himself. Bad luck. That's.. that had to be it. She was just having some really bad luck. She didn't deserve this. She was actually TRYING, Celestia-damnit. Why can't the world just cut her a break?


11:22PM
Dusk's Apartment

It had taken a bit for Trixie to stop crying so Dusk could drive her home. "Home" - his home, but right now, he didn't want her anywhere else. Rarity, too. She'd come with.

The three of them came in, and Starlight was passed out on the loveseat, topless, but with her bottoms still on. She'd had four wine coolers.. and she was out like a light.

Dusk: "Er.." He frowned. "..she wanted a friend. She was fully clothed when I left, I promise."

Rarity: "I'll worry about her tomorrow, dearie. For now, YOU get the couch. I'm going to take your bed, with Trixie." She patted his head, having to reach up to do so. "She needs someone close to her, and given the circumstances, it mustn't be a male."

Trixie: "..sorry, Dusk.." She looked down at the ground. "For everything. I'm.. I'm so sorry. Everything I touch just seems to go wrong." She shook her head.

Dusk: "We'll worry about it in the morning, okay?" He gave both of them a hug at the same time. "Get some rest."

As they went into his bedroom, he nabbed the couch. He was exhausted. The .45 Longslide was placed in the coffee table drawer with the spare magazine. Jacket off, shirt open, belt off, he kicked off his boots, and sprawled out as best he could.

He just wished, for once, the world would cut Trixie a break.
