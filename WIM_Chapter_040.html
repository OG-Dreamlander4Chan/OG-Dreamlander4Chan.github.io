Part 1: Technical Discovery

TIME: 22:37 Herdiet Western Time
DATE: War Day 417/25 Quintillus 1873
LOCATION: Special High Security Prison, Moscow Federal District, Union of Herdiet Stableist Republics

We made good time to the Technical Institute. The doors had to be blasted off their hinges with an RPG, and Radaz had that handled. I also noticed he seemed to be flirting with Sinichka, a bit. I hoped they'd both survive the war, or even the next few minutes.

K: "Major. Where?" I pointed at the pictogram signs.

Kosegin: "The magical laboratory is there." He pointed to.. a beard? Interesting. "Technical laboratory is there." And to a radio antenna with an Erlenmeyer flask next to it. "Passageway to airfield.. is that one." Looks like a cartoon airport. "There is choke point leading from Technical Laboratory to Airfeld, a supplies hallway used to move techical components to airfield for testing in testing area at edge of field." He nodded.

K: "Alright. I'm going to get my sword. Kosegin, Stupka, you come with. Twilight, take command. Get to the Technical Lab and get my cell phone back. We'll rejoin and push to the airfield." I gestured.

Twilight: "Alright." She scowled a little, she didn't want to split up, but she understood why.

K: "One more thing. Everyone wearing a labcoat, suit, or high rank, must be killed. We can't risk any of them surviving to rebuild the Herdient Union's atomic program, or just as bad, recalling any technology from my phone. We'd just be trading peace today, for war tomorrow - probably right after we get rid of Tirek, when we'll be at our weakest."

Rarity: "Shooting unarmed ponies..." She gave me a distressed look.

K: "Their weapon is their knowledge. I'm.. sorry. I never wanted you girls to have to-"

Applejack: "K's right."

Fluttershy: "Applejack!"

Applejack: "We let the wrong pony live, we'll be picking ashes of our friends outta the walls in no time." She said grimly. If she had her hat, it'd be down over her face.

Twilight: "I-I.. can't disagree." She frowned.

Pinkie: "Don't worry! I know it's not easy-peasy-lemon-squeazy.. but we'll do what we have to." She patted them both on the shoulder. "For Equestria!"

K: "Come on." I nodded. "Let's do this."

We advanced into the hallways. Most of the guards from this area had tried attacking back towards the prison, so there were precious few ponies guarding the scientists.

Kosegin and Stupka were behind me as I entered the lab. I found that the scientists here were all wearing what I could only describe as "government-issue mage robes." Brown in color, but so much more uniform and official-looking than a proper Mage's Robe. The pockets had tools in them, many I didn't recognize.

They were also all Unicorns.

That set me on edge. They were running around, trying to hide things in sacks and crates. I saw my sword on the table, there, just ahead of me. A Magi-Scientist ran up to grab it, and I grabbed him, smothering his muzzle. Kosegin was fast with the knife, and jammed it in his ribs.

I took back my sword. Hefting it, I could feel.. odd feelings..

K: "I wonder."

I looked up at the Magi-Scientists in the open bay. They probably needed to die as well, just to be sure. Being Unicorns, they could hit us all with magic, though. And that was a danger.

K: "If I can.." I imagined Sombra. "..are you strong enough, my friend? SOMBRA, GIVE ME STRENGTH!"

I felt it. His power. His shards. I looked at the Magi-Scientists, and willed the shards to SHRED them to pieces. And, they did. Hundreds of small black energy shards fired from the blade of the sword, as I held it aloft, and turned them into swiss cheese. As a side effect, the room darkened some, and I could feel a coldness in my soul.

I didn't know it, but, Sombra felt our connection of friendship, and nearly passed out, trying to send me strength through the sword. I hadn't been told, but, my wish to heal him had turned him into an Alicorn. He did, though, manage to tell Sunshine that I was alive, and it was time.

K: "..well, shit!"

Stupka: "Easy! OORAA!" He patted my back, hard. It was like getting a pat on the back from Big Mac.

K: "Come on, there's work to be done." I nodded, feeling a bit woozy from all that.

We exited the room, just as Twilight and the girls exited the Technical Lab. Twilight ran up with my cell phone in her teeth, and handed it to me.

Twilight: "They.. couldn't get past the screen lock." She made a face. "But.. we killed them all. Just to be safe. It's fully charged, though, they figured out how to do that." She also handed me the charger.

Pinkie: "One of them had SEE-CRETS!" She giggled. "He can't tell them to anyone else, now!"

Creepy and funny. I pointed towards the airfield.

K: "We're going to have zero cover until we can get to one of the Airship-Bombers. We get out there, and you need to shoot-and-move as fast as possible. Stupka, you and Kosegin in the rear, you're the strongest. I'll be right by you. If someone falls, we need to grab them, as we can't afford to stop or slow down. Twilight, you and the girls go first. Get to the nearest bomber, clear it, and get it started taking off. Don't wait for us. You have to execute the plan, no matter what." I put a hand on her shoulder. "Even if it's me down there."

Twilight: "You're asking me to..!" She shook her head, horrified. "K! I CAN'T DO THAT! YOU CAN'T ASK ME TO KILL YOU!"

Dash: "HELL NO!"

Applejack: "Honey!" She didn't say much more than that.

Fluttershy: "K, you can't be serious, we-"

Rarity: "Darling! Heavens no!"

Pinkie: "It'll be fine!" She stopped them. "TRUST me! Please?" She gave them puppy eyes.

Stupka: "These girls care! You must be important!" He chortled hard. "They love you like brother!"

K: "Well.." I shrugged. The only one I *hadn't* slept with was Fluttershy. So, in a way, they were kinda.. mine?

Stupka: "Come! We go!" He nodded towards the passageway to the airfield. "We liberate homeland today! Is worth many lives, but ours? We ready to lay them down." He looked at his fellow Freedom Fighters. "No matter what it take."

Part 2: When The Bough Breaks...

TIME: 22:55 Herdiet Western Time
DATE: War Day 417/25 Quintillus 1873
LOCATION: Kosmonets Air Force Base, Moscow Federal District, Union of Herdiet Stableist Republics

We ran out on to the airfield, and as I expected, there were far more targets than we could possibly handle. We just ran, fired, reloaded, and ran towards the giant pumpkin seed that was closest to us. It was an airship similar in design to the Crystal Kingdom ones, but huge, and with thrust-only engines, no lifting fans. It was like a giant wing, and the wing itself provided lift, with the gas bag providing near-neutral bouyancy.

Veliky went down first, and I grabbed him momentarily, only to realize that he, too, was gone. Too many bullets. So, I grabbed his AK and dual-wielded them. Hosing down targets as best we could, I saw that Borz went down next. Stupka pulled him over his shoulder, and kept shooting.

Radaz went down with a hit to the leg, and I could hear him tell us to leave him. Sinichka was next to him, and picked him up, telling him something about how she wasn't going to let him die here.

Twlight reached the bomber first, and got inside. I could hear shooting, and screaming. I got to the stairs just as the pilot was thrown to the ground. We'd made it. I hurried inside.

I helped everyone else in, and pulled up the gangplank.

K: "Fluttershy, see to Borz and Radaz. Twilight, get this thing in the air!"

Twilight: "Right.. right.. let's see.."

It took her a minute, but she got the engines started, and the backwash from them knocked over a whole company of troops. She set the engines to full power, and aimed for the back-up runway - the main three were partly blocked, and she didn't know if she had the space to take off.

Twilight: "I got it!"

I got into the seat next to her, and realized that it was the weapon's station. It also had the communication station next to that, which Dash took over, with Kosegin next to her.

We got into the air.. barely.. just managing to clear a smaller air ship that was desperately trying to ram us as we took off. The backwash from the bomber knocked it over like a toy.

K: "We did it! Kosegin.. you know the channels. Signal the Premier."

Kosegin: C> "Arkose Communications Center.. this is Major Kosegin, and.. General-Field Marshal K---- K--- of the Equestrian Royal Army. The human, Comrades. Summon the Premier.. he has an ultimatum. We are in possession of bomber and two Atomic Devices."

Arkose Comspony: C> "Chto?! DA!" He sounded like he couldn't think of how to respond.

Within a few moments, and with Twilight now at a high enough altitude and circled back around to make a run at the Airbase, we heard the Premier's voice.

Premier Zhelezo: C> "MAJOR! What is the meaning of this!?"

I took the mic.

K: "Premier Zhelezo. This is General K. You have developed a weapon of insane power and insane implications. I am about to show you what us humans are capable of." I looked through the bombardier's sight. "Your prized airbase, Premier. It is about to become nothing but ash."

Premier Zhelezo: "YOU IMPUDENT MONKEY! YOU WOULD NOT DARE!"

K: C> "Bet." I pressed the release button on Bomb #1. I could hear the bomb bay doors open, and I could hear the bomb being released... "Cover your eyes! COVER YOUR EYES!" I curled up into a little ball as best I could, switching the radio completely off.

A moment later, a bright flash, and an immense wind.. a cloud came up.. a massive cloud of death. The one weapon I never wanted to see, use, or even think of.. had just been deployed. For a moment, the sun rose in the wrong place. For a moment, the citizens of Moscow were treated to a real taste of what Fear really means.

It took us a few minutes to get away from its effects, and the bomber was almost uncontrollable for a moment.. but we got away. And then, I raised the Arkose again.

K: C> "Premier.." I started. "..I have one bomb left. And I'm heading right for you. Three minutes to target. I will wipe out Moscow, and you with it, if you don't give in to my demands. You have no way to stop me. I just erased any Airship that could catch us in time. You haven't any anti-aircraft capability that could hit a target flying this high."

Premier Zhelezo: C> "YOU...!"

Silence. Several seconds of silence.

Marshal Stipkin: "General K, this is Marshal of the Herdiet Union Anatroty Stipkin.. the Premier is.. no longer capable of negotiations. I am prepared to hear your demands."

K: C> "My demands are as follows: You will agree to cease all hostile actions against NEIGHTO. You will agree to NEIGHTO observers of my choosing to oversee the destruction of every scrap of your atomic weapons program, and the liquidation of everypony that knows anything technical about it. You will cease your oppression of the Donetesk and Raizina regions and withdraw your forces. You will then sign a formal Non-Aggression Pact specifically with Equestria, and in its language, specifically state that this is an apology for the insults that myself and my general staff have received at the hands of your troops. Furthermore, the Roostians that are with me, stay with me. You will not send spies, assassins, or saboteurs after them. Understood? One minute to target, Marshal." I said in a grim voice.

Marshal Stipkin: C> "...the Herdiet Union accepts your demands. I have no choice. Either I do, or hundreds of thousands will die, yes?"

K: "Ten times that would have died, had I not done this, Marshal. You know it, I know it, and now, everyone knows it. I've been in contact with Princess Luna of Equestria via telepathy. The NEIGHTO alliance has sent five divisions towards your border.. so, even if you had attacked, we would have not only been ready, we would have inflicted a far greater revenge on you, than your initial attack could have cost us." A stretch of the truth, but whatever. "Who would have won, then, Marshal? The dead, that's who."

Marshal Stipkin: C> "..I see your point, General K. We accept the demands. You may depart our air space in peace."

K: C> "Roger that, Marshal Stipkin." I nodded. "Don't trust him, Twi. Dash, plot us a course to the nearest border that also takes us as close as possible to any major inhabited cities. If he tries to take us out, I *will* use the other device."

Twilight: "But, I mean.. at least we did what we could."

Kosegin: "With this, even if he betray his word, would be decade or more before he can construct another device. Everything was there! Everything! Now, it is all gone."

Dash: "Nearest border is Canida.." She shrugged. "First city I can see on there is Yellowknife." Strange it has the same name as the 'real' one.

K: "Head for it." I nodded. "Everyone else, get some rest."

Part 3: Expected Betrayal

TIME: 04:03 Herdiet Western Time
DATE: War Day 418/26 Quintillus 1873
LOCATION: Airspace over western Union of Herdiet Stableist Republics

Fluttershy: "K. I've seen to Borz and Radaz. Radaz will be okay, but Borz needs a doctor badly." She put a hoof on my shoulder. "A-at least the others.. they.."

Stupka: "They die for freedom! Is no greater cauze!" He guffawed. "They were my brothers. They shed blood with me. Remember them, always, I will."

K: "Me, too. I want their names on The Hero's Wall." I nodded glumly. "I barely knew them, but I barely knew Berry Punch. She made the ultimate sacrifice for her friends, too."

Twilight: "Not even Equestrians.. and you still care."

K: "Always."

Applejack: "HONEYBUN!" She came trotting up (with effort, she's still quite weak).

K: *Exasperated sigh* "Let me guess.. Airship Fighters." I simply stated.

Applejack: "A'yup, Honeybun. They're after us.. I c'n see'em out the back observation deck. Gainin' on us, too." She glanced back reflexively.

Dash: "We're over an hour from the Canidan Border." She looked at me, concerned.

K: "Bastard. I knew it was all a fake." I shook my head. "No matter. Even if he has Atomics left over, I can make more, now, if I have to. He doesn't want that." I grunted. "Repeating the damned Cold War over here.." A dismissive hand wave. "Kosegin, this thing have any weapons?"

Kosegin: "Da. Two machine gun mount. One on spine, one on belly, behind bomb bay." He motioned and pointed with his hoof.

K: "Dash, Rarity." I pointed.

Dash: "Ten seconds flat.." She grimaced, and pecked both me and Applejack on the cheek as she moved past us.

K: "..did you two..?" I nodded to her.

Applejack: "They jes' kept us locked away, first week.." *Ahem* "..girl never kiss's 'n tells, Honeybun."

K: "Wonderful." I groaned a bit. I was in so much sexual trouble, I'd spend five years after the war, paying my debts.

Rarity: "I'm looking forwards to a bit of final revenge.." She said, darkly. "Ready, K."

K: "Range on those M-G's, Kosegin?"

Kosegin: "470 lines. About 1200 meters." He nodded.

K: "Alright, girls, let them get close."

Twilight: "We're over the wilderness, now, K. There weren't any other major-"

K: "I know. I get it. He's having us ambushed in the border lands, so he doesn't have to deal with a second atomic strike on a populated area."

Twilight: "The Marshal, or..?" She looked at me, and back at the controls.

K: "Doesn't matter. It's one of them. Probably the Marshal - this seems like a major military move. And a smart one. Zelezho doesn't - didn't - strike me as all that smart." I shrugged.

Dash: "They're gettin' close! They'll be on us in no time!"

K: "Let 'em have it! But make your shots count! Aim for the engines or the gas bags!"

Rarity: "No problem, Darling." She gave a haughty smirk, and was the first to open up.

K: "Twilight, prepare us for a crash landing. Kosegin, you know this area?"

Kosegin: "Yes. Many trees. Large forest. There are some.. smaller.. clearings.. you are thinking of setting down?" He looked at me, cocking his head to the side.

K: "I'm thinking, these fighters are going to get us whether I like it or not. He might have sent multiple squadrons after us, and certainly any elite ones he can get. It's what I'd do. We're just trying to hold them off as long as we can. Kosegin, take over as Nav. Find us a spot we can land at, as close as we can get to the border. Assume we have no more than 30 minutes' flight time."

Fluttershy: "I'll get everyone in the back, ready." She nodded and trotted off.

Kosegin: "Yes.. yes.. is a large clearing about.." He pulled out the navigation map - we were more or less on the very edge of it, outside their planned operational area. "..here. Twenty minutes flight time. What of the bomb, General?" He nodded towards the Bomb Bay.

K: "I'm going to dismantle it and take the Core with us.. that's the important part of it. If I have the Core, I can reproduce it. Seven should do the trick." I shrugged. "I know how to make a Hydrogen Bomb, too. Multi-megaton warheads. City busters. He doesn't want that. His goal will be to deny me the core at all costs, killing me is now a secondary concern." I one-handed gestured. "Twilight, Kosegin, start aiming for that clearing. Pinkie, with me."

Pinkie: "Yup-yup-yup! Hee-hee.. I think all the dying is done for us, today.. but I think there's going to be a lot of hurting, now." She shrugged. "Oh, well! Come on." She tugged at me.

I went into the bomb bay, and opened the bomb the same way I did the one in Nieghpon. This time, though, I had someone with me that could help..

K: "Okay, it's open. Pinkie, squirm in the access panel and get that bomb core. Remember, it's radioactive.. don't swallow it." I smirked.

Pinkie: "Remember your promise." Was all she said, and she squirmed herself inside.

I could hear the gunfire all around us. At least four enemy aircraft. If they'd attacked NEIGHTO, this would have been VERY bad..

Then, I felt the port side engine thump and lurch.

K: "TWILIGHT! SITREP!" I yelled towards the cockpit.

Twilight: "PORT ENGINE OIL PRESSURE DROPPING! THEY GOT US!" She yelled back.

K: "Pinkie?" I looked back into the opening, as I felt Twilight correct the pitch of the aircraft with the other two engines.

Pinkie: "GOT IT!" She squee'd, and slid out with the core, stuffing it into her Party Bag. "All done!"

K: "Get ready for a crash landing! Everyone, get towards the rear of the plane!" I moved up towards Twilight. "How long?"

Twilight: "With the damage to our gas bladders from the ground troops, the atomic explosion.. the new bullet holes.. about five minutes. We can make the clearing, no problem." She pointed. "I'm already aiming for it. But, what then?"

K: "We fight our way back to Allied territory." I nodded. "It should be about 50 kilometers.. that's.. going to be about three days, I figure. We have wounded, after all."

Twilight: "Can.. can we make that?"

K: "Yes. Now, land." I patted her on the shoulder.

Twilight: "LANDING PROCEDURES! I-" I tugged her out of the chair.

K: "I'll take her in. Get in the back with the others. Pinkie has the bomb core." I gestured. "Kosegin, go with her."

Kosegin: "You know.." He nodded at the front wind screen, and to me.

K: "DO IT, Major!" I addressed him.

He grabbed Twilight and dragged her.

Twilight: "But-but!"

Kosegin: "Your general, he knows what he doing. Trust him, eh?" He gave me a grin. "T'ank you.. for giving me a chance.." And out the cockpit he went.

I could see the clearing coming up. It was pretty big, indeed. Looked like a meteor or something had scoured out a path in the trees, ages ago. I aimed right for it, and tried to manage the engines, so I could slow us down as much as possible without crashing completely. A belly glide.. not a nose dive. I could hear Dash and Rarity get out of the gun turrets and join the others.. I just.. needed a bit of luck.

[End of Part 3]


Part 4: Crash


TIME: 04:21 Herdiet Western Time
DATE: War Day 418/26 Quintillus 1873
LOCATION: 50 km from the Canidan border, Union of Herdiet Stableist Republics

I slid us in, alright, and it wasn't easy. I had zero piloting skills, just what I'd done in video games, and none of them were Flight Sims of any detail. The aircraft scoured the ground as it landed, the gas bags acting like gigantic air bags, and absorbing the impact well, popping loudly, but preventing the aluminum skeleton from shattering and killing us.

Once the plane stopped, I got out of my seat, and checked my Morgan. All ready to go. My rifle was in the back, and I hoped it was okay. I got back there, and the girls were helping everyone up.

K: "We have to get out of here. Those fighters probably won't risk landing, but they'll be damn sure to tell everyone where we are. They could have troops on the way in probably an hour or two, and we have about 50 kilometers to cross." I shrugged. "I figure at least five hours before troops arrive in force. In our condition, we'll be lucky if we can manage 20 kilometers a day.."

Borz: "Leave me, then.." He said, somewhat weakly.

K: "I leave nopony behind." I patted his shoulder. "I don't care that you're not an Equestrian, you volunteered to follow my orders. That means I'm responsible for getting you out of the mess I led you into." A grin. "Flutters, Dash, AJ, rig up litters for Radaz and Borz. Stupka, Rarity, Twilight - strip this thing for anything useful. Kosegin, get the map charts from the cabin. Pinkie, Sinichka, cross level all our ammo and weapons. Make sure everyone's got a shooty stick."

They went about their duties with aplomb. Meanwhile, I exited the wreck to scout around. It looked pretty clear.. and I went off to take a leak. I admired how quiet it was, and managed to find a wild apple tree.. picking one that looked ripe, I stuck it in my dump pouch for later. I returned to the others, then.

K: "Honey, about five meters from here, there's an apple tree. See what's ripe, we need at least some food that we can eat on the go." I nodded towards it.

AJ: "On it, hon." Off she went.

And horses can forage for grass and vegetation in a way that I can't. At least they'd be well fed. I'd have a full stomach, but I'd probably be stuck to eating apples, berries, some tree leaves, and maybe some wild tubers. Decent, but not exceptional. I considered eating bugs, but I knew that was only for absolute emergencies. Some bugs can screw up your gut bacteria something awful, even if they ARE protein.

After about an hour, we were ready to go. We were low on water, as the survival kit in the plane only contained enough canned water for the four person crew, for two days, at strict rationing. It also only had a small amount of food, mainly broth cubes and crackers. Simple and when combined with forage, enough to sustain a crashed air crew until help arrived. It also contaiend two knives, an axe, and some heavy thread and thick needles - likely for scavenging the gas bag's outer or inner layers for shelter. Sinichka got enough of it together for a basic shelter for all of us, and litters for Radaz and Borz.

With that, we exited the wreck. No sign of the fighters.. judging by what Rarity and Dash said, they'd damaged or shot down every one they could see, before running out of time and ammo. They might NOT have seen where we landed.. but they'd have a general idea, and the wreck was too large to camouflage effectively.

Without much discussion, Kosegin got out the map and compass, and started directing us towards the border.

It was cool.. probably in the mid-50's F. And this was daytime. In the supposed Spring. That meant nights would be very cold, and judging by the clouds and the remaining weather instruments in my bag, a chance for freezing rain or snow.

One good thing about that? Airships don't do bad weather. At all. Freezing rain? They wouldn't be able to get anywhere near us until it cleared. It'd also slow down THEIR ground troops as much as it would US. Probably more, since they'll be carrying more of a burden, and have to maintain cohesion..


06:37 Herdiet Western Time

I ordered us to stop and rest. I knew a camp fire would give them a clue as to our direction, but the wounded needed it.

Applejack: "I'mm'a take Stupka and Sinichka an' see if'n I can't find more stuff t'eat." She nodded. She'd managed to get a bag full of apples from the tree, earlier, but hadn't foraged more than that.

K: "Alright, don't go too far." I gestured. "Flutters, how's the wounded?"

Fluttershy: "Okay. Borz IS getting weaker, though. He might not make it. It's cold, we don't have winter gear, and he needs fluids." She shrugged. "I-I'm no doctor, though."

I gave her a half-hug.

K: "Take Rarity and see if you can find some clean water. If we have to, we can boil it in the water ration cans."

Rarity: "Sounds fun, darling." She patted Fluttershy and paced off.

Pinkie was busy telling Radaz and Borz some stories. Twilight and Dash were tending to the fire, and distributing what we had with us.

Kosegin: "..they are very loyal to you, General." He said in a way that meant more than words.

K: "I love all of them like family. They've been at my side for almost every major battle I've seen, and some I haven't. They've fought along side me, seen things they never should have, and don't blame me when I don't get things perfect." I shrugged. "And I'm engaged to the tawny-coated one with the blonde hair - Applejack."

Kosegin: "You are lucky stallion.. uhm.. man. She would be considered good catch in Roostia.." He shrugged.

K: "Really? Because of her Special Talent for growing food?" I tilted my head.

Kosegin: "Well, yes, but for her strength, beauty, and loyalty as well. She is.. total package, yes?"

K: "Yes." I grinned.

Applejack returned about twenty minutes later, with some things, and Sinichka, and Stupka carrying a lot of salvaged, foraged stuff.

K: "Oh! What did you find?" I tilted my head.

Stupka: "Old mining camp. Was much left behind. Tools, cookingswears.. also found meat for you, human."

Applejack: "Ah found somethin' looked like a goat, a bit, an' got it. Hope ya like goat meat." She grinned.

K: "I'll take anything." I shrugged. "I can't afford to be picky, right now."

Applejack: "Lemme get this all fixed up, an' we can git a proper meal."

Another hour spent cooking and consuming food. Rarity and Fluttershy found a river with clean water, and we made sure both Borz and Radaz drank and ate their fill. Their bodies' own ability to heal injury was the only things keeping them going, and they needed all the fuel they could get.

The "goat" Applejack prepared for me, was poached in some water, salt and herbs. The mining camp had salt in a barrel, so AJ had been sure to grab as much as she could. It tasted pretty good, actually. Like a thin soup with large meat chunks in it. She dried as much of the meat as she could, in the time we had, so it would be preserved for a few future meals.

A two hour break.. the sun was totally up, now. We abandoned our temporary camp, erased it as best we could, and started off in a semi-random direction for the Canidan border..

[End of Part 4]


Part 5: Warm Rescue

TIME: 13:22 Herdiet Western Time
DATE: War Day 419/27 Quintillus 1873
LOCATION: 32 km from the Canidan border, Union of Herdiet Stableist Republics


It had been a full day and change since we crashed. Out in the woods in the indeterminate border between Canida and the UHSR. Borz was stable enough, with plenty of food and rest. Radaz was okay, though Fluttershy had to stop and forage for some antiseptic herbs to add to his bandages, as he had started to develop an infection.

We hadn't seen any sign of Herdiet troops, though. I guessed that, perhaps, bad weather had delayed a search party, and they'd had to pull troops from distant areas. I could almost feel them at our backs, though. I knew they were there. Speaking of bad weather, there was a lot of high wind in the upper and middle atmosphere right now - I knew that was the only reason they didn't have airships over our heads.

The previous evening, I'd managed to speak to Luna, though, as I found out, my intermittent contact with her was largely due to  my own condition - I was no longer "synched" with her magic, as I'd been away from it for far too long. It seems it interrupted her ability to connect with me in the Dream Realm. She promised to correct that. That and radioactivity. The mild radiation put off by the Bomb Core made my dream with her, static-y, and my condition meant she couldn't physically touch me any longer. It had been over two months since our last time together..

K: "Hold up.." I held up a fist.

Fluttershy: "What is it, K?" She was up on point with me, since neither Borz nor Radaz needed immediate care.

K: "Is your wing healed enough to fly up a bit?" I asked, quietly.

Fluttershy: "Y-Yes.. a little." She flexed her injured wing. I could still see a bit of a dent from the teeth. "What do you need?"

K: "Fly up about fifty meters and look behind us in all directions. Take the binoculars. Tell me what you see. Be careful."

Fluttershy: "O-Okay.." She took them, and scrambled up a rock, some.

K: "Defensive Positions, rear!" I hissed at the others.

Fluttershy went up, alright.. up to the top of one of the trees.. and looked back.. scanning.. scanning.. and zoomed back down. I then heard a bullet whistle far overhead and strike a tree somewhere. Sounded like a pebble. Then, I heard the shot.

K: "Just.. how many?" I shook my head.

Fluttershy: "At least fifty.. half a company. All in camouflage." She shrugged.

Kosegin: "VDV. Paratroopers. They no doubt were dropped at crash site, and took a wide search fan towards Canidan border.." He shrugged.

K: "How far?" I nodded to her.

Fluttershy: "About.. an hour? They're on that broken terrain we crossed.. the one with the rope bridge you cut." She nodded back.

K: *Sigh* "We can't take them all. Alright, let's move, best possible speed."

We'd made it less than half way! I seriously didn't think we could cross 32km of wooded terrain before they could catch up to us. But, we had to try.


TIME: 14:12 Herdiet Western Time
LOCATION: 27 km from the Canidan border, Union of Herdiet Stableist Republics

Partly because we'd found a passage that went down into a shallow valley, and partly because we picked up a bit of speed, we'd managed 5 kilometers. I could now hear the VDV troops shouting behind us.. they were almost within range.

K: "Girls, defensive position.. get to good cover. Stupka, Kosegin, Sinichka, get over here and cover Borz and Radaz-"

Radaz: "I can fight, General.." He gave me a grim look. "Please. I have reason." He looked at Sinichka..

K: "..get him a weapon." I understood only too well.

Borz: "Leave me! Please! You will all die, otherwise!" He pleaded.

K: "I have no intention of doing that. We all get out, or no one does." I nodded to him. "Remember what I said.."

And I got into a good position behind a large, flat-ish rock, and dug in as best I could, getting some broken logs up around me. They were maybe 50 meters from us, but with the thick forest, it was very hard for either side to pick targets.

K: "Rarity. On your go. Remember, make your shots count. We don't have a lot of ammo." I nodded to them all. "Rifleponies, engage on Rarity's go. Subgun ponies, wait until you see the whites of their eyes."

Rarity: "Got it.. ready.. and.." She sighted down the SVKM.. and fired a single shot.

I saw an officer that had just mounted a log get hit in the head, and jerk, falling over.

VDV Pony: "Otkrytyy ogon!!"

The woods erupted in gun fire. We were taking shots from up on the hill, from the sides from troops we hadn't spotted, and from our front. The VDV troops weren't idiots, they stayed in cover and returned fire smartly.

A squad formed up to our left, led by an NCO. Armed only with my Morgan, I aimed over and peppered the small clearing with shots. Two went down, but the rest charged.

VDV NCO: "OOOOOOOORAAAAA!!"

I reloaded quickly, and raised up, firing five shots, and hitting the NCO. His three remaining troops took immediate cover. Before the trailing squad that I KNEW was pepperpotting behind them had a chance to advance, I fired to where I thought they'd be, and killed THEIR NCO as well.

The remaining VDV held fast. Weakness in the Soviet/Herdient military structure - no initiative from the lower ranks.

Two junior officers, with a rocket launcher soldier, came up by them. BAD NEWS.. I was still reloading. He directed their fire to suppress me, and I had no choice but to duck down.

They were going to saturate us with RPG's.. we'd either break and run and die on the hoof, or die right-

*CRACK!*

VDV Rocketeer: "OY! Eto bol'no! Aahhhh!"

Wolf Voice: "CANIDAN RANGERS, OPEN FIRE! ARRRRRRRRWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!"

Suddenly, the woods behind us, and the rim of the valley to our rear, erupted in Wolf Howls.. and gunfire. Herdiet VDV troops started dropping like flies, started to break and run at the sound of wolves. Each shot a kill, each VDV trooper falling over dead. Within seconds, it was over.. and I had a very large wolf in a Canidan Army Ranger uniform, hugging me from behind.

Captain Havoc: "Didja miss me?" *SLURP-SLURP!*
