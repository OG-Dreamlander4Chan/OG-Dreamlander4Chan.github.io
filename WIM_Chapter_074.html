PART 1: High Noon Duel

TIME: 09:52 ERDT
DATE: War Day 700/4 Tertious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Transport Train, 0.7km from Appleloosa, Texas

Dusty: "..and before violence got here, he had been in 35 duels already - he's NEVER lost!" She was going on about Sidewinder.

I was strapping on my Cowboy Rig. Masterson Revolvers, two, canted down so I could reach them perfectly with outstretched arms. Cocking spurs on each holster. I stretched my fingers and arms, and shook myself out a bit, to loosen my muscles.

Dusty: "DAMNIT, K!" She shoved me against the wall, and held me there, tears in her eyes. "I may not be Applejack, or Rarity, or Princess Luna.. but.. but..!" She sobbed into my chest. "I CARE ABOUT YOU, TOO!"

I hugged her with both arms.

K: "Dusty. I've literally been preparing for this moment all my life. In the human world, the Wild West Era happened a hundred years and more before I was born - it was the stuff of legends and myths by my time. Something we revered. We had toy guns much like this - they didn't shoot anything, but they worked kinda the same. I had them when I was a kid.. I used to practice my quick draw all the time, trying to out-draw my own reflection in a huge mirror." I stroked her mane. "Of all the violent confrontations there are.. this is the one I've prepared for the longest." I tilted her chin up. "Dry your eyes. I'll be fine." I leaned down and kissed her.. passionately.

Dusty: *Sniff* "I've come a long way from bouncing drunks. K.. because of you.. I found my calling.. I found so much. I can't bear the thought of losing it. Me? Dying? That's fine. But, not you.. not.." She looked down, and then back up at me. "I wish you'd come to Las Pegasus, first!"

K: "In some strange alternate reality, I probably did, and we're both wrestling drunks and doing side jobs for the Mafia." I shrugged, smiling. "Together."

Dusty: "Mm." She wiped her face. "That's.. I think that's the difference between me and Jackie. She worries, but deep down, she knows you'll come back to her. Me? I don't." She shook her head. "So I try to keep up with you, to protect you myself, if I have to." She sighed. "You matter so much to me. You're not just Equestria's general, or the commander of NEIGHTO.. you're.. something a lot more than that, to me."

K: "I get it." I nuzzled her a bit.

Stepping off from the wall, I looked at myself in the mirror. I had redressed in Western attire made by Rarity to my specifications - black tighter-than-usual slacks that carefully hugged my hips and legs, but flared out some at the ankle, straight white shirt with collar, black Kentucky Colonel tie with silver cinch at the knot, silver-cloth vest with embellishment, black tailed coat, black stetson. I was hoping to just wear this around town and silently live out my cowboy fantasies...

..now, I was going to do battle, dressed like a cross between Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp. I rolled my shoulders, and my neck, and stepped out the door, letting my spur-less cowboy boots clunk on the ground (spurs, around here, being considered an erotic bedroom-only item for the most serious practitioners of BDSM).

I could feel the wind on my face. Gentle, but it was there. Heavy with fate. I knew what I was about to do - essentially execute a fellow pony, to preserve the lives of more ponies, more kin.

I paced towards the crossroad.

I wondered in my mind, in the few actual call-out duels that happened according to how Hollywood depicts them, if the gunfighters considered what I was considering - not just the tactical, but the consequences.

Sidewinder was waiting for me.

Sidewinder: "Didn't expect you'd dress for the occasion!" He rose up to his rear legs, and rested his hooves on his gunbelt buckle.

He was dressed in chaps, a leather vest, and a blue shirt under it, with a large bandana scarf, and a stetson hat that looked almost identical to Applejack's old one - save, it was black, not brown.

K: "If we're going to do this, Sidewinder, we're doing it right." I nodded, running my index finger along the brim of my hat. "Sheriff Silver Star dictates the draw." I stated.

Sidewinder: "Fine by me!" He chuckled. "Gonna haft'a send a letter to Cousin Applejack, 'pologizin' fer gunnin' down her husband.."

K: "Speaking of that, how do I know your troops will surrender? And not just hose us down if things don't happen to go your way?" I stuck my thumbs in my gunbelt, around the buckle.

Sidewinder: "My word not good enough?" He tilted his head.

K: "If you'll give it." I nodded back.

Sidewinder: "I do!" He looked at the Sheriff. "Alright, tin star, let's git to it!"

Sheriff Silver Star: "Alright.. when the bell rings!" He held his hoof over a small kettle bell with a draw string. "Ready.."

My hands went to my side, relaxed.

His forelegs did the same.

We had a moment where our gaze met.. what he didn't realize was, I wasn't actually looking into his eyes, I was looking AT his face.. for signs of muscle contraction, stress..

Sheriff Silver Star: "And... DRAW!" *DING!*

I was faster by a mile - a cocking spur on your holster means you only need to pull the trigger once the gun gets clear of the holster. And I was NOT using long-barrel Mastersons - I was using Bat's own specials, the three-inch Banker models. This made my draw much faster, as less barrel had to clear the holster, and the guns were much lighter. When the hammer arm hit the cocking spur, I felt the hammer click back three times as it was rotated up. I pushed forwards at the same instant my finger squeezed the trigger.

My Bang came a full half second before his.

My Bang hit its target. Knowing I'd already have to aim low to hit him, I made sure not to rise off the level of my own belt buckle.

His bang went into the dirt as he flinched.

Blood seeped down the front of his shirt.

He pressed a hoof over it, pulling it away, and looking at it.

I recocked, just in case.

He looked up at me. Stared.

I judged my hit well. He was a dead man standing. I hit him in the heart. His heart was completely destroyed, but he had enough oxygenated blood in his system to stay conscious for about one minute.

Sidewinder: "Ya got me. Wasn't.. fast's.. I thought.." He refused to fall.

K: "I've been practicing for this day since I was a child. I picked weapons specifically for this fight. You never had a chance." I stared at him. "Sorry, Cousin. I have to save my home.. and our family."

Sidewinder: "..mm. 'Spect'ya'will't'that.." He winced, his vision blurring. "'S.. Horseshoe Hill.. fer me.." And he fell flat down on his face.

I drew my other Masterson, cocked it, and pointed both guns towards his troops that had assembled to watch the fight. Everyone else did, too.

K: "Throw down your weapons and surrender! We had a deal!"

Of course, by this time, I had the New Mulexico Ranger Company, and a full flight of my new F/A-1 Falcons backing me up, along with the survivors of Appleloosa's Militia and Gendarmes.

Wisely, they started throwing their weapons into a large pile.

I went over to Sidewinder's body, reholstered, and knelt down by him.

K: "Don't worry, Cousin. I'll take care of the family." I pet his mane.

He wheezed his last, stuttering, breath. It sounded relieved.

I took his own Masterson revolver, and looked it over. Black ivory grips, no embellishment, but nickel-plated. Considering I didn't have any being sold that way, this was aftermarket. I thumbed the hammer - Masterson's had an external hammer for looks alone, since the original Custer revolvers, I thought, looked silly without one. He'd slicked it up, too - the single action cocking notch was very positive. The trigger bar pull was smooth in single action. Very smooth. He'd built a good tool, here. I stood up, and stuck it in my belt. I'd now use it for Good.

Dusty trotted up to me and just put a foreleg around my hip, and hugged into it. I knew that's what set her apart from Applejack - she couldn't trust me to come back alive. Applejack, could, despite her protests when I face incredible risk. And that, folks, is what separates a real marriage relationship from one that wouldn't necessarily work - you trust your partner to come back to you every day they leave.

[End of Part 1]

Part 2: Mild, Wild West

TIME: 10:30 ERDT
DATE: War Day 710/22 Tertious 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Appleloosa, Texas

We were seated in the town diner, everyone being fed breakfast or brunch. Given my light nibbles before the fight, this was a welcome meal. Dusty ate some, but not that much. I could tell, partly, it was stress.

Dusty knew where the boundaries of our relationship were, but I knew, when it was just her and me, she'd fully take the Wife role. She was a Herd-approved mare in the paddock of my love life - but, unlike Rarity or any of the other girls, she would more readily step up in the more private moments.

I think, for her, it was a fantasy she was living out, where I never met Applejack, and married her instead. I had to admit, I had similar feelings. I wouldn't betray Applejack, but having her around was more.. wife-like.. than Rarity.

I didn't know what to do about this, since I enjoyed it so much. I'd just let things take their course, and see what played out. I was still thinking in the back of my mind that I wasn't going to survive the war, or, at my moment of victory, I'd be cast back into the Human World and deprived of my enjoyment of the peace I'd help forge. If that happened, I had a feeling Dusty would marry Applejack if she could, both out of a desire to cherish my memory, and to be close to the other woman that obsessed over me like she did.

That suited me, fine. I didn't want her to be lonely if something happened to me. Like I said, I had feelings for her, too. And I could readily imagine myself in a totally different set of circumstances, where her and I were bouncers for the Las Pegasus Mob, and doing occasional jobs for them.. the Chicago side of me, relished the thought of being a Wise Guy. The more virtuous side of me.. maybe not so much.

Sheriff Silver Star: "K! That was some right fancy shootin'!" He came over and patted me on the back. "Never thought I'd see the day someone out-drew ol' Sidewinder." He shook his head.

K: "I'm sorry I had to kill him - I'm not as good of a shot as some of my own legendary wild west figures." I shook my head a little.

Sheriff Silver Star: "Awe, it's okay, Nephew." He sat next to us. "Better he dies t'family, I figger." He looked over at Braeburn. "Speaking of which.."

K: "He wants to marry Soarin." I cut right in. "That's why they're seated together." I looked up at him over my coffee cup.

Sheriff Silver Star: "Mm." He nodded slightly. "He's my brother's kid, y'know?" He looked over at me. "Fer figger'n family records, Applejack is mah cuzin's daughter." He nodded slowly. "Whole family's from here - Apples, Orchards, Fields.." He shook his head a little. "Wh'how's Granny? She's mah Ma's sister, ya know."

K: "Huh. I thought she was AJ's father's mother." I blinked. "Granny Smith Apple as her maiden name. Not Granny Smith Orchard."

Sheriff Silver Star: "Nah, she's an Orchard, like me." He nodded. "Now, we got the.. whut wuz yer last name a'gin?"

K: "K---." I smiled a little. "In antiquity, my family had a large castle, and were Lairds in the Scots tradition. Then, we moved to Ireland - Ironland for you - some of us, for supporting the wrong side in the English - Ambleonian to you - Civil War. Which, I understand, never happened here."

Sheriff Silver Star: "Sounds raight pretty!" He grinned widely. "Kinda surprised mah niece ain't here, too."

K: "I have her and the other Elements of Harmony in the Crystal Kingdom, finding clues about the Rainbow of Light." I shrugged.

Sheriff Silver Star: "So, how many great nieces and nephews have I got, now?" He beamed a grin.

K: "Pomme Florale, who's 12. Starlight Mint, who's 13. Koringo, who's 5. And Rolfe, who's also 12. Starlight Mint is with me and Luna, though." I shrugged - and rightly figured he'd be able to discern the genders based on the names (not that I could). "But, she sees Jackie as another mother." I smiled warmly. "I'm so happy that, around here, families can be so easily extended. It just.. makes a lot of this all worth while."

Sheriff Silver Star: "Yup! Shore does." He nodded with a huge grin. "Gotta bring 'em out this way! Lett'em see the Mild West."

Dusty: "I don't think today could be considered 'mild', sir." She was sill only a Gendarmes Sergeant, and Silver Star was officially ranked Sheriff, which is equal to an Army Colonel.

Col. Whiterider: "General K!" He paced over, seeing as I was done with breakfast. "Pleasure t'finally meet'cha!" He stuck out his hoof.

Indeed, Colonel Whiterider was pure white - coat, mane, tail. He had some slight grey streaks in his mane, but I wasn't sure if that was coloration or age - he looked like he could be 30 or 60 all at the same time. I shook hooves/hands with him.

K: "Colonel Whiterider. Dusty here tells me you're something of a character." I smirked a bit.

Col. Whiterider: "A'yup. Used to run a Mild West Show in Las Pegasus - trick roping, hurdle jumps, archery, things like that." He nodded.

I noted that he opted for a pair of Mastersons for sidearms, and was loaded out as a Sniper for a Hathcock 11mm rifle.

K: "I bet.. you'd like.."

I dug into my large bodybag luggage case, and pulled out my latest creation - the Model 2 Carbine, Winchester. It took me ages to make a lever-action rifle that worked with ponies, and of course, AJ helped. It was a direct reproduction of the Winchester 1894 lever-action, and chambered in 9x18mm, 9x23mm (the NEIGHTO-standard pistol round), 10x18 - x26 - x30 - and x35mm Pony Express series cartridges, and a new civilian round I developed especially for it, the 11.5x32mm Winchester Magnum (yes, a recreation of the .45 Win Mag pistol round). This example was chambered in 11.5x32mm Winchester Magnum.

I presented this to him.

K: "In my world, the lever-action carbine and rifle were instrumental in taming what, for us, was a very WILD west. They offered better range than a revolver, and faster shooting than the single-shot rifles that were prevalent at the time - this being long before humans developed semi-automatic firearms." I held it out to him. "In honor of this great battle, and your reputation, sir, I'd like to offer you the first production model."

He seemed a bit surprised, but he accepted it, and very quickly figured out how it worked. For ponies, I used a smaller stock than a normal Winchester, and a shorter barrel and magazine tube. It looked chopped down, from a human's perspective. The version I'd given him, held 8 + 1 rounds.

K: "I warn you, it's chambered in this." I held out a single 11.5x32mm Win Mag round. "It's a lot spicier than those Mastersons." I smirked. "And, yes, a new revolver will be made soon, specifically for this round."

Col. Whiterider: "This here's a fine piece of work, sir." He figured out almost instantly how to spin-cock it. "Real fine! What's for range on this here beast?"

K: "About 150 meters. A trick shot like yourself, with practice, should hit 200 or better, easily." I nodded to him.

Col. Whiterider: "While I pray to Celestia I'll never have to use this to harm another creature.. if that should come to pass.. I have every confidence your new creation will do the job, rightly." He smiled with reverence as I slid over a couple of boxes of ammo - all of it heavy 260gr thumpers.

Sheriff Silver Star: "..speakin'a battles, I'm just glad no one got kill't." He harumpfed. "Durn pole-cats, attackin' at dawn like that - I hadn't even had mah mornin' cup'a tea, yet!" I was then reminded that most ponies drank tea over coffee in most parts of Equestria.

K: "The enemy is rarely polite." I smirked a little.

At least the fight was over, and we'd made new acquaintences. I was going to go inspect the arsenal after this, and meet with Strongheart again, after quite some time. I hoped the West was pacified, for now.

I wondered, though - how did Sidewinder end up with Tirek?

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Get The Heck Out Of Dodge

TIME: 21:11 ERDT
DATE: War Day 703/7 Tertious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Dodger City, Konzas

Interestingly, Equestria took the base name of the Konza people and used it instead of the Algonquin form of it.

We pulled in to the station at nine in the evening, and disembarked. The team and I headed to the nearest saloon - the Dry Gulch (also a term for an ambush, for non-native English speakers) - and when we approached...

Pony: "GIT OUT!"

And a pony came sailing through the saloon doors. Then a Griffon. Then a Minotaur.

In a heap. Unconscious. We could hear the sounds of fighting from inside.

K: "Dusty?" I nodded to her.

She gave a frustrated sigh, pulled out her extensible baton, flicked it in her jaw, and trotted in. I followed. Being larger than most species on the planet, I had an advantage. Everyone followed, some grabbing a hunk of lumber or whatever was handy.

Inside, was bedlam. A massive bar fight had broken out, and there were ponies, griffons, a couple yaks, some buffalo, and a few minotaurs duking it out. While most of them had guns, none of them drew them - there was a rule about this, an unspoken social rule. A bar fight should not intentionally be deadly - drawing a gun is the same as showing your cowardice.

I had a minotaur slam into me, and almost knock me off my feet. I spun him around and slapped an elbow into his muzzle, knocking him to his knees. I down-kicked with my heel, to the back of his thick skull, dazing him. I then kick-rolled him outside.

Gaze: "Ooch! Orders?!"

K: "Quell the riot. Non-Lethal Only." I nodded, and dashed forwards.

Now, I'm not a fighter. I learned a few simple moves from some folks along the way in my life, but nothing devastating. Right now, I wanted to be Steven Seagal.. all hits, no return fire. Not going to happen - I got a wooden chair splintered across my back. I fell to my knee, grabbed a chair leg, popped back up, and cracked the chair-hitter over the dome.

The city's Gendarmes were nowhere to be seen, so, once again, my team stepped in to fill the gap. With that chair leg, I started dishing hits, going for limb locks, extremity hits, and only occasional head shots, being careful not to strike lethal areas. I got punched in the dick by a brown pony in a leather vest, with a scar on his cheek, which sent me down to my knees, only for me to get up, and spin the chair leg in my hand, and bring it straight down on his muzzle.

Dusty roundhouse-kicked a Griffon getting fresh with her, impacting his chest, and sending him out the window. Gaze was whoopin' and hollerin' like a true scotsman, using a hunk of wagon axle like a Claymore, and bashing everything in sight with it. I watched Dusty get two Yaks on her, only to writhe out from their grasp, kick one in the shin, knee-snap to the second one's gut, foreleg-smash the second one over the head, and whip-extend her right foreleg to crack the first one in the head with the pommel of her baton.

I was in the middle of punching a tan pony with a Spot over one eye, when I realized.. it got quiet.

Blackfeather: "I think they had it, Kinta!" He chuckled to his partner.

"Kinta": "I reckon that's that, Blackfeather." He patted his friend on the back.

Every fighter was dazed, laid out, or thrown out. My troops were still standing, when a very pretty mare in a slightly torn dress made her way over to Kinta, and poked him hard in the shoulder.

Miss May: "And WHO'S going to PAY for all this!?" She snorted.

"Kinta": "Aww, Miss May.. I'm sure SOME of 'em's got bounties!" He looked sheepish.

Dusty: "Ah.." *Ahem* "Sergeant Dusty Dunes, Royal Gendarmes. What happened, here?" She paced up to them, and whipped out her notebook.

I followed behind, after whispering to Norfy to see about cleaning the place up a bit.

"Kinta": "OH! Hiya, Miss!" He bowed his head a bit. "They call me the Lone Stranger!" He gave a bit of a cheeky grin.

On Earth, Roy Rogers and Trigger were both rolling so hard in their graves, I think my home planet's axis is being thrown off.

Blackfeather: "I'm Blackfeather, of the Chickasaw." He nodded, more to me.

K: *Whispering to Blackfeather* "You're the brains of the outfit, clearly - I know what Kinta means in Chickasaw." I winked at him, and he looked away with a small snort. "I'm General K, Commander of Equestria's military." I nodded to them, having pulled back.

By the way, Kinta means Rodent or Beaver.

Miss May: "Oh, good!" She walked over to the reigster, and pulled out a stack of IOU's, which she showed me. "Your soldiers have run up one HECK of a bar tab, General! They owe me 6,373 Bits!"

Dusty: "Ah." She turned back to The Lone Stranger. "So, w'how did this start?"

Lone Stranger: "Well, that fellah over there.." He pointed to the dick-kicker with the scar. "He's Black Bart. He's wanted, see? And I bumped into him by accident while I was tryin' to get a drink-"

Miss May: "You mean BEG me for one!" *Huff!* "Honestly, I don't know why I put up with you!" *Sigh* "If you weren't the bravest cowpony.."

I could see what was going on here. He was a lovable goof of a hero, his partner was the brains of the outfit, and his love interest gets frustrated with him, but she cares very deeply for him, despite his goofs.

K: "Dusty? Chem? Check the.. uh.. rioters and see if any of them have Warrants, eh? And remit payment to The Lone Stranger, here." I nodded to him.

Miss May: *AHEM!* She glared at me.

K: "Ah.. minus any damages to Miss May's property.." I rubbed the back of my neck, then looked at her. "I would like to see those IOU's."

Miss May: "Certainly." She handed them over, politely, this time. "Care for a drink, anyone? Carrot Juice is 5 bits a pitcher."

Which, if you hadn't guessed, is a bit expensive.

Norfy: "A bit high, isn't it?" He looked quizzical, but handed over a 5B coin.

Miss May: "It's because Black Bart's employer, Mason Jarson, owns the rights to the main water source for the town, and he diverts it to a private lake." She shrugged. "He charges a premium to anyone that wants water."

K: "The Arkansas River should flow right past the town..." I furrowed my brow - I knew the real Dodge City was built right by it.

Miss May: "You mean the Akansa River? Flows to Big Rock, Akansa?" She corrected me, politely.

Name changes, indeed.

K: "Yeah, that. What's up with that?" I tilted my head, looking over the IOU's.

Miss May: "Mason owns all the land on the south of town. He changed the riverbed to flow more to the south, and dump the excess into his private lake. Either we get water from his lake, go around his property and go south, or go around his property to the west." She shrugged. "He even charges the military for the fort! I expect that's why the soldiers never have any money - he has a Toll Road set up." She sighed.

K: "..who's in charge at Fort Dodger?" I looked at my Staff. Rarity or Pinkie would know, instantly.

Braeburn: "Major Colton Whinny, 'cuz." He nodded. "I know - he's originally from Appleloosa!"

Spitfire: "There's also a Captain Lighter Aire assigned there, sir." She turned to me, dusting off her uniform. "He's a former Junior Flyer, I remember him - he was a class ahead of me. Strong flyer, big ego." She shook her head.

K: "Miss May, I'm going to give you a government voucher for these IOU's. I don't carry that much cash on me." I shrugged. "You can hand it in at any State Office of the Treasury for the amount written on it, in coin." I pulled out the voucher book, and wrote one out for 7,000 Bits.

Miss May: "Gee, several IOU's for one? What a deal." *Dripping sarcasm*

K: "Not much faith in Her Majesty's Government to pay up?" I handed her the voucher.

Miss May: "General, if I had faith in the government and five bits, I could buy myself a pitcher of carrot juice." She narrowed her eyes. "But, I can't blame you - you're not a pony, you don't get it." She wasn't being insulting with her tone, more.. defeated.

Spitfire: "General K is an honorable man, Miss May. You'll get your money." She was firm about this, but didn't verbally engage her dismissive remark.

K: "Also, we will pay for our food and lodgings in cash." I shrugged. "Since you don't seem to trust vouchers."

Miss May: "Ah-huh.." She sized us up. "..rooms will be 400 bits - I'm assuming y'all'a be doubling up. You want some dinner? I'll charge ya 100 bits for the lot'a'ya." She nodded at the prices.

K: "That'll be fine." I handed her 5 100-bit pieces.

Chemical Lens: "General, most of the ones in that heap there, have Warrants on them - the grand total is 7,150 bits." She nodded.

K: "Miss May? Can I get an estimate on damages?" I tilted my head.

Miss May: "Five thousand should cover it - they broke almost all my chairs, and a lot of my glassware." She sighed, frustrated.

Chemical Lens, being an Officer in the Gendarmes, and part of the General's Staff, wrote her out a voucher for 5,000 bits, and a second one to The Lone Stranger for 2,150 bits.

Chemical Lens: "This should cover it, ma'am. I'll go get the town's Gendarmes." She nodded.

Miss May: "Oh?! HAH! Don't bother - they're all Mason's men!" She snorted.

Chemical froze in her tracks, and narrowed her eyes - corruption in her Gendarmes?! Unpossible! Imthinkable! She turned and stared at me.

K: "Well? What do you want me to do?" I shrugged.

Chemical Lens: "For me to take command of the Gendarmes force here, I would need to be ranked Sheriff." She nodded. "A town the size of Dodger City should have a full Gendarmes Company - it's both the County Seat and the largest town in the area, with a population of 27,000." She ticked off the facts - she was still analyitical, despite opening up and seeing herself. Moreso that she didn't have Wide Lens here, and doubly so that she was pissed.

K: "You're Sheriff." I nodded. "I also appoint you Special Marshal of Celestia's Royal Courts." Which was equivalent of making her a U.S. Deputy Marshal, and a Colonel in the military.

Chemical Lens: "Thank you, sir." She smiled very slighlty, and looked at Dusty. "We'll eat first, then we'll go see about the corruption in the Gendarmes."

Braeburn: "Aw, ah'm comin' with!" He nodded.

K: "We all are - secure the prisoners for now. The ones without warrants, I think it's best we left them to go home and sleep it off." I nodded.

Chemical Lens: "A wise choice, sir. But, I will officially fine them for property damage, first." She gave a small nod as Miss May brought out food for all of us.

Well, we were stuck having to handle another problem..

Part 4: Dodger City

TIME: 21:37 ERDT
DATE: War Day 703/7 Tertious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Dodger City, Konzas

As expected, it was horse food - fine for me, except the hay. It was, indeed, hay sandwiches with tomato and lettuce, some finer hay as a main course, and salads, with a side of fresh apples.

I sat and grabbed a salad to myself - no one objected. They knew I couldn't eat hay. The Lone Stranger and Blackfeather joined us as I waved them over.

Big Mac: "You be okay with this, Brother?" He cocked a brow, looking at Miss May. "You know, humans can't eat hay."

Miss May: "Hm. I think I have some ham steak left over.. let me go see, I'll cook it up for you, if I do - do you eat onions and garlic?" She tilted her head, taking my special order.

K: "Oh, uh.. yes, yes. Cooked garlic, though, we can't digest it well raw. Onions can be cooked or raw." I shrugged. "Except hay, I can eat most things ponies can. Has to be cooked some times, but.."

Miss May: "Oh, okay! Kinda like a Griffon, but more vegetables. Let me go see what I have." She smiled and headed off.

Lone Stranger: "She's real good at takin' care of her customers!" He grinned sheepishly.

Blackfeather: "Yes, even when you can't afford to pay." He grinned very slighlty.

K: "I didn't want to impose." I shrugged. "She's been through enough as it is."

Mac: "Yer mah brother, I'mma see you get fed right, or Applejack'd never forgive me." He looked me right in the eye.

Dex: "And here, this was just going to be a meal stop!" He grinned.

K: "We seem to attract trouble." I shrugged, as I ate.

Chemical Lens: "More that, we have a higher than average chance of finding trouble, just by travelling. In fact, the probability that we find another source of trouble before arriving in the Crystal Kingdom to meet up with the Elements is exceedingly high." She looked around the table. "Though we seem to have sufficient talent and firepower to deal with it."

Gaze: "..she ain't wrong, suh." He smirked.

Spitfire: "Indeed." She shrugged. "I was hoping for some more action before the war ended - being a commanding officer is great and all, but a lady likes some action." She smirked at me.

K: "Glad to have you along, really." I shrugged. "You'll need it, too. I'm probably going to take your squadron and make you scouts, instead of multi-role air support." I made a small gesture with my fork. "You all have a lot of combat experience, and I'm going to need that on the tactical level when we hit Tirek."

Soarin: "That why you had me and Spitfire along?" He raised up, looking at me.

K: "Yes, actually. You're the top two in the Wonderbolts, and though the unit has been mostly split up to command or advise other formations as the military got bigger, I want to bring the Squadron back together and have you as tactical air assets for the Invasion. After the war, besides doing air shows, I would hope you can do COIN and counter-terrorism duties.." I trailed off. "..though, I'm hoping it's just air shows."

Spitfire: "We know, K." She reached over and patted my hand with her hoof. "I admit, I was skeptical we'd need a military force, but we did.. and I'm glad you trained us." She gave me a small sigh. "And I know as well as anyone how much you'd rather this all be over." She looked around the table. "I think we all do."

Lone Stranger: "Seems you have a lot on your plate, Mr. General." He blinked.

K: "Just K, sir." I nodded to him. "You're not one of my soldiers, Lone Stranger."

Blackfeather: "Mmm. You are a wise leader, still." He nodded.

I was served my ham steak, and it was probably one of the best I'd ever had. We spoke for the next hour or so - and our prisoners were getting ornery in that time. So, I finally spoke up..

K: "Seems the prisoners are getting eager to see their cells." I nodded. "Chem? Dusty? Braeburn? With me. Mister Lone Stranger, I don't command you - you're welcome to come. You too, Mister Blackfeather."

Lone Stranger: "Alright. Sounds fun."

Black Bart: "Oh, yeah, turn us over to the Gendarmes." He snorted at me. "You'll see." He narrowed his eyes at me.

K: "You get extra charges." I pointed a finger at him. "Assaulting a Royal Official. In my capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Equestrian Military, I'm considered to have a Royal Appointment, and have authority to negotiate with foreign governments." I shook my head. "Goes the same for your friend over there that hit me with a chair."

Black Bart: "Mimsy, you pinhead!" He struggled in his ropes.

Mimster Munster: "Sorry, Boss!" He was Mac's size, and he looked.. a bit smarter than Black Bart, but not as ambitious.

We got the prisoners to their feet, and marched for the Gendarmes station in town. When we got there, though..

Chemical Lens: "General. The guards aren't out front." She noted.

Lone Stranger: "Never are." He shrugged.

We walked into the courtyard of the walled building, and up to the door.

Chemical Lens: "None here, either." She snorted.

And then, inside, with 17 prisoners. There was a pony at the desk, kicked back, reading the local newspaper.. and his uniform is a shambles.

Chemical Lens: "YOU AT THE DESK! STAND AT ATTENTION!" She demanded.

Desk "Sergeant": "And who the heck are you?" He cocked a brow. "Hysterical ma-AAAAAAAAAAAAA!"

Chem trotted over and yanked the chair out from under him, letting him hit the floor.

Desk "Sergeant": "Oh, I'm gonna WHUP you good for THAT one, missy!" He got up, only to have Dusty on him.

Dusty: "I wouldn't, sugar." She narrowed her eyes at him. "This is Sheriff Chemical Lens." She raised her eyebrows. "Your superior officer?"

Desk "Sergeant": "She ain't Mason! An' that's who I reports to!" He looked over at Black Bart. "BOSS! Wh-"

Chemical Lens had her Morgan in his ear.

Chemical Lens: "You're under arrest for criminal conspiracy in the first degree, and treason to Princess Celestia. Drop the gun belt, or I drop you." She sneered.

Voice from the back: "Pastey! What's going on up there!?"

I drew fast, one gun on the prisosners, one gun on the doorway. Chemical Lens never broke eye contact with the so-called desk sergeant. Dusty? Raised her Bradley towards the doorway. Braeburn had his trained on the prisoners as well.

Black Bart: "CORIANDER! GO TELL THE BOSS WE-" *KRACK!*

I hit him over the head with the butt of my revolver.

Coriander: "What in tarnation!?" He came out, and saw us, and immediately went for his gun.

I already had the drop on him, so I just fired, and hit him in the chest. He did a half-spin and went down.

Pastey: "You're in big trouble, now!" He said.

Indeed, I could hear a lot of hooves coming this way.

Lone Stranger: "Ooo.. this could be a problem.." He finally drew his Earp revolvers, and made ready.

Blackfeather: "Indeed, Kinta." He brought up a Sagebrush Shotgun.

K: "Dusty? Frag the hall." I nodded, coldly.

Dusty pivoted, and when she was sure the hallway was full of ponies, fired a grenade into it. It was timed fused, so it bounced once, then exploded. We could hear a lot of them start screaming.

We were now not just going to kill perhaps one or two, but a LOT of our fellow ponies - we had officially crossed a line that hadn't been crossed on this scale since The Winter of Hard Feelings.

I felt sick. Criminals or not, these were our people.

I looked at Black Bart.

K: "You made me do this." I shook my head. "But, the order was mine."

Black Bart: "What'cha gonna do, now, human? Heh. Got any of them high-and-mighty morals le-" *PLAM!*

I shot him through the eye. I then turned inwards towards the prisoners, and executed each one with my Mastersons, and Sidewinder's.

Lone Stranger: "..oh.." He blinked.

K: "No, I'm fresh out." I spat on his corpse, and quickly reloaded all three guns.

Dusty: "K.." She blinked at me, clearly concerned.

K: "I didn't want you keeping all that bad Karma to yourself, Dusty." I clicked the last Masterson shut. "Anyone else have the stomach to kill your fellow ponies?"

Lone Stranger: "I.. uh.." He looked down.

Blackfeather: "We never have to kill, before. Either of us." He nodded to me.

Braeburn: "Ah'm with ya, cuzin." He narrowed his eyes, and grabbed the radio. C> "Mac? It's goin' down. Git over here - we need help!"

Chemical Lens: "So much for my idea of commanding these crooks into compliance." She shot Pastey in the head without emotion, and pivoted on her hoof to face the hall, helping Dusty flip the desk over.

K: "Sorry, Chem. They forced my hand." I took cover behind it, while Braeburn took the wall, facing the only doorway into the room. "Stranger, Blackfeather - time to choose. Are your ideals of law and order worth killing for?" I looked at both of them. "Or is killing too much for you to bear?" I didn't raise my voice at all. "I understand if you can't bring yourself to do it. Ponies were never supposed to be hurting and killing other ponies. But, if you can't do it, clear out, or you're going to get killed."

Lone Stranger: "I cain't decide if killin's.. the ultimate expression of law 'n order.. or the worst." He lowered his head. "Ah cain't do it!"

K: "Blackfeather, get him out of here." I insisted. "No shame, Stranger."

Blackfeather pulled him out.

Chemical Lens: "I have a problem with this, too, sir.. but I'm your Sheriff, now. I must restore order. If I have no choice but to kill.." She looked up at the doorway..

They started trying to pour in - at least a dozen of them. We just started shooting. They shot back, the ones that could. We dropped them, all of them, with minimal return fire.

Chemical Lens: "..then I shall kill." She steeled her gaze.

Dusty: "Am I the only one here morally flexible enough to just kill them, and not really care? I mean, they're trying to kill us - it doesn't matter who they are." She shrugged.

Braeburn: "Actually, Dusty, I expect you is!" He chuckled as he reloaded. "Aw, I'mma have nighmares after this.."

K: "Brae's right." I shrugged. "I'm going to feel like this was my fault for the rest of my life."

Sink the Spider: "HEY IN THAR!" Called a voice. "THIS IS SINK THE SPIDER! I'MMA RAIGHT HAND T'MASON!"

K: "He's up the hall, around the next bend. I don't think you could bank-shot, that, could you, Dusty?" I looked at her, and returned the call. "WHAT'CHA WANT!?"

Dusty: "Not a chance." She shook her head. "The hallway's too long."

Sink: "LISTEN UP, GENERAL! WE'RE POWERFUL SORRY ABOUT THIS HERE MISUNDERSTANIN'! WE'D LIKE T'JUST FERGET ABOUT ALL THIS! EVERYONE WALKS AWAY!"

K: "NOTHING DOING! I WON'T TOLERATE CORRUPTION IN MY OWN MILITARY! HERE'S -YOUR- OFFER: TAKE OFF MY UNIFORMS, AND GIT! I HAVEN'T SEEN YOUR FACES, YET, BUT CELESTIA HELP YOU IF I DO! YOU'RE ALL GETTING CHARGED WITH HIGH TREASON - IF I DON'T SHOOT YOU DOWN, YOU GET THE ROPE! ANY PONY THAT GIVES UP NOW AND RUNS, AND DOESN'T CAUSE ANY MORE TROUBLE, GETS A FREE PASS! THAT'S MY OFFER! GOT ME!?" I could hear Mac and the others get to the outside door.

And the clinking of a belt-fed weapon. Mac went back for the heavy stuff. Good Brother! I no-look held my arm out, and felt my Bradley hit my palm, which I gripped, and pulled into a kneeled ready stance.

Sink: "NICE OFFER! I THINK YOU JUST COST ME HALF'A MY PONIES!"

Indeed, I could hear shuffling hooves making their way out of the building, in a hurry.

Sink: "I AIN'T QUITTIN! AN' YOU CAN'T-" *Wet thwap*

Teddy: "TANGO DOWN!" He yelled from outside.

K: "RUSH!" I got up, flicked the selector to full auto, and charged the hallway.

We moved up the killzone of the hallway, and I spun around the corner, firing my Bradley into the room - five ponies, all trying to figure out what to do next, were gunned down. I caught at least one pony in the flank as they tried to get out the back door.

K: "TEAMS OF TWO! SWEEP AND CLEAR!" I called out. "These are TRAITORS! If they surrender, they get the rope!" I said, disgustedly.

It's easy to justify violence against outsiders. It's not easy to do so with such a kind and gentle race, to one of their own. Before guns, they would have just beaten these people up, or destroyed their property. Maybe used slingshots to cause minor injury and pain. Now? Everyone had guns. Killing and death was a daily thing in people's lives thanks to Tirek, but it also cheapened everyone else's lives...

...once more, I was in a situation Tirek helped create, but I felt was my fault.

Part 5: Dodge Wild

TIME: 23:13 ERDT
DATE: War Day 703/7 Tertious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Dodger City, Konzas

Mac: "We're done sweeping the building, Brother." He nodded. "Total count? We found 32 discarded uniforms. Killed another 37." He shrugged a bit. "Don't blame yourself. I know you're going to." He put his foreleg around my shoulder. "This's hard, yeah, but if we didn't have a way to deal with them.." He meant our weapons. "..what could we do? Can't overpower an army this size with just the girls."

Dusty: "Mac's right." She nodded, fixing her helmet. "If Mason Jarson had an army like this, and we didn't have guns.. what could we do? We'd have to have the Royal Guards handle it, and it'd've been an almost even fight with every Guard pre-war."

Spitfire: "Yeah. The numbers add up." She nodded. "You're right, K. We aren't supposed to be killing our own. But, I have a feeling, this would have happened anyway - or, Mason Jarson would be free to make people suffer for the rest of his life, at the very least."

I was frustrated.. and my team read me perfectly. And supported me. Despite not being the Elements, they knew me as well as I knew myself. I really did have very good friends.

K: "Tomorrow, we confront Mason." I nodded. "For now, let the bodies stay in the building."


TIME: 23:44 ERDT

Back in my room, which I was sharing with Dusty, some time later, I started undressing. Desert Camo for tomorrow. No more screwing around. Dusty was doing the same thing. Once we were undressed, I sat on the bed.

She slithered up behind me, letting her mane down. Her forelegs wrapped around me, hooves rubbed my torso.. and I realized my stomach was once again flat and taut. I'd fully recovered from my torture at the hands of the Herdiets.

Dusty: "I want you." She slithered around to my lap. "Is that bad?" She asked, coyly, kissing my shoulder.

K: "No, not at all." I caressed the back of her head. "I have to admit.. seeing you in action arouses me." I smirked. "Must be your special talent calling out to my General side." I bent down and met her lips.

We banged like horny animals. It was.. as always.. amazing to fuck someone I cared about so deeply. She was a bit dirtier than Applejack - she liked being spanked, her tail used as a 'fuck handle' as she put it.. and I didn't mind, because I knew it pleasured her.


TIME: 07:22 ERDT
DATE: War Day 704/8 Tertious, 1004 C.S.

Spitfire got us up. Silently, she came in the room, and poked my bare ass with her wing. I sat up, and was about to speak, but she put a hoof over my mouth.

I knew from her demeanor - and the fact that she had her Ridgway SMG on her shoulder - she didn't want to join us. Though, she did raise an eyebrow after catching sight of what I had.. morning wood is a hell of a drug. I gently roused Dusty, and we silently, but quickly, got our uniforms on.

Spitfire: "Town's crawling with Mason's ponies." She said quietly. "Three of them are downstairs. The others are getting ready. They've taken control of our train."

K: "We liberate the train, then we contact the nearest Militia unit for reinforcements." I nodded slowly. "Pass it along."

Spitfire left, as we finished getting dressed. Equestria's military desert pattern camo was distinct, and a take on the 6-color Chocolate Chip camo used by the US military. The Gendarmes' desert pattern, as before mentioned, was a five color desert shade of the Military forest pattern (which was basically M81 Woodland with extra color and patterning to aid blending), and was designed to work in any light condition - the Military pattern favored daytime, as a special mesh shroud was intended to be used at night. Both our undershirts were black.

We eased out of our rooms, with the same ammo we had when we went to bed - for me, that was a half-empty rifle. For Dusty, she had 23 rounds left in her active mag, and one spare. She had all four of her Morgan magazines, and I had ten speedloaders for my two (actually, three) Masterson revolvers.

Hoofsteps downstairs, coming up, told me we'd already been invaded. I waited at the top of the stairs, while Dusty covered everyone getting out of their rooms. The first one up, I shot once in the head. The second one fell underneath the first. The railing next to me exploded as the third fired a Sagebrush Shotgun at me, and largely missed. I hit the deck, lifted up a bit to peek over, saw the barrels, and ducked back down as the second barrel fired and hit the wall just over my head.

I snapped up to my knees and leaned over, firing the rest of my magazine at him and his companion. The others came up behind me.

K: "We have to get to the train." I nodded at them.

Mac: "Good idea. Hope they haven't looted it." He nodded to me.

I pulled out my Mastersons, and slung my rifle. I eased down the stairs, as we moved together. Miss May, The Lone Stranger, and Blackfeather were tied up by the bar. I went over and cut them all free with my bowie knife.

K: "Looks like your choice, isn't much of a choice any more, Stranger." I nodded solemnly to him. "I'm sorry."

Lone Stranger: "No.. I'm sorry. I feel like a coward." He shook his head. "I've been able to go the last five years without seriously hurting anyone. Even after I got my guns. Never. Now?"

Blackfeather: "A reckoning has been brought on our planet. And his name is Tirek." He nodded slowly. "He brought us deadly violence. Had this human not come, we would be his slaves already."

Lone Stranger: "Then, I suppose.. I better.. be ready to fight. For real. I need a gun."

I handed him Sidewinder's Masterson.

K: "A bad man used this for evil. I want a good man to use this for justice." I patted him on the shoulder.

Lone Stranger: "You got it."

Braeburn handed the minion's Sagebrush to Blackfeather, along with the minion's shotshell pouch.

Miss May: "Stranger! Aw, yer gonna get kill't out there!" She hugged him.

Lone Stranger: "Maybe so, Miss May. But if I don't do something, those varmints are gonna hurt a lot of people." He hugged her back. "Wait for me?"

Miss May: "Until the flowers bloom in the spring." She beamed a smile.

K: "We'll.. be back sooner than that." I shrugged. "Come on." I gestured, and made for the door.

The town was quiet - everyone was keeping inside. I looked towards the train, about half a kilometer from here. I could just feel there were blackguards everywhere.

Mac: "Rush or creep?" He checked his belt one more time.

K: "Creep. Doc?" I flicked a look to him.

Dr. Allcome: "I suppose, today, I must think of my solemn vow as a Hippocratic Suggestion." He shrugged, and hefted his Ridgway. "You know how I feel."

K: "I do." I nodded. "No real choice, you know? They're dedicated."

Spitfire: "I don't think aerial recon's a good idea. They'll be expecting that, I figure." She nodded, and moved with us.

Soarin: "No kidding." He snorted, and hefted his Bradley.

K: "Eyes peeled, heads on a swivel. Get some space. Don't bunch up." I reminded them.

Not that they needed it - once on the street, they spread out in a good stagger. An outlaw shoved open the windows on the second floor, only to get a burst from Mac's Merill. Three of them rose up from behind a watering trough. Dusty, me, and Braeburn pivoted and cut them down.

We weren't pepper-potting, this time. We were advancing at a tactical creep. This was urban warfare with a different bent to it than Marelin - the road was fairly narrow in town, and there were a LOT of angles to consider..

Chem shot one coming out of an alley, and Doc backed her up when a second came around the corner of a stairway. He sighed and shook his head, seeing his own handiwork.

Octavia: "Hey, Vig, try not to get shot again, huh?" She smirked.

Vigilance: "Oh, what's the worst that could happen?" He smirked. "The General cuddles up to me in bed again?"

Dex: "Dude!" He snorted a laugh.

Dusty: "Hm?"

Vy: "After one of our first battles, Vig was injured and put in the same hospital room as Applejack, and.." She trailed off.

K: "I accidentally slid into the wrong bed, intending to get intimate." I shrugged, offhand, snapping into position as five came around the corner, aiming and firing with each hand seperately.

Octavia and Teddy had my back this time, with Teddy easily sniping two, and Octavia downing the last one.

Vigilance: "I got hurt in Marelin, too." He shrugged.

Teddy: "Train's just ahead.."

He crept to the corner of a building, and pulled back. He tapped his hoof five times, and indicated one was high up, the other four at ground level. I pointed to him and indicated the high target, while I indicated us, and the lower targets. We pivoted around the corner, and opened fire. They dropped before they had a chance to even aim.

We rushed for the train, and got on board. They hadn't had time to go through much of our stuff.

Spitfire: "I'll secure the weapons car." She tapped Soarin and went for it.

Vigilance: "Comms." He nodded, and I followed him.

The radio room of the staff car was locked, still. I got my keys out and opened it. The radio was undamaged, so I sat down, and keyed it up.

K: C> "This is Alpha Actual to Fort Dodger. How copy, over?" I waited.

Nothing.

Vigilance: "Equipment checks out, sir. Nothing wrong with it." He shrugged. "They're getting our singal - they're either ignoring it, or the radio's shut off."

I looked at the map behind me, and calculated that I should be able to reach Fort Barned.

K: C> "Fort Barned, this is Alpha Actual - how copy, over?" I waited.

I knew they could hear me.

K: C> "Fort Barned, this is Alpha Actual. Respond now, that's an order." I sternly commanded.

Dusty: "Do you think Mason Jarson owns them, too?!" She shrugged.

K: "No, more likely, they said some outlaws might be trying to impersonate me, or something. SPITFIRE! GET IN HERE!" I motioned for Dex to come in, too. "Here, you try."

Dex: C> "Fort Barned, this is Romeo 2 Actual, how copy, over?" Romeo being the basic radio designation for Royal Rangers.

Spitfire came in, and also took the mic.

Spitfire: C> "Fort Barned, this is Whiskey One-One Actual - RESPOND!" That being her callsign when flying.

K: "There's no way they're ignoring all those radio calls." I shook my head. "Someone's getting court martialed over this."

Spitfire: "It's, what, a hundred kilometers? I can fly that in forty minutes or so." She shrugged. "Less if I push it. Soarin should be at least five minutes faster."

Vigilance: "Here." He took the mic. C> "Fort Barned, this is Romeo One-Seven. I don't care who told you what, your general is in deep trouble, and if you don't want my horseshoes shoved SO FAR up your FLANK that you SPIT NAILS, then you BETTER RESPOND, RIGHT NOW! Over!"

After a few moments, we finally got a response.

Major Wagoner: C> "Persons on this frequency, this is Major Pio Wagoner, Fort Barned Commander. State your business."

K: C> "This is Alpha Actual. Code book is on page BLUE. Countersign for 8 Tertious is ARTEMIS. Repeat, BLUE ARTEMIS. How copy, over?" I was looking down at the General Staff codebook, reading from it.

Major Wagoner: C> "...code.. confirmed!?" A pause. "Alpha Actual, please report status! Over!"

K: C> "Status is we are in deep trouble. I need reinforcements. NOW. And I want to know why my calls were ignored! That is NOT the radio procedure I wrote! And I want to know who took responsibility for breaking that procedure!"

Major Wagoner: C> "Alpha Actual, we received information from Fort Dodger that someone impersonating Alpha Actual was going to attempt to call for help in the morning, and we were to ignore the call. That it was a trick by Tirek's forces to draw us away so they could raid the fort."

K: C> "Regardless, Major, my radio procedures accounted for this with the Code Book. Now, who took responsibility for violating my procedures?!"

Major Wagoner: C> "..responsibility is mine, sir." He said with regret. "I would testify that Major Trails objected, and that I took responsibility, with Sergeant Major Tombs as a witness."

K: C> "Then, Major, I want you to personally lead the reinforcement column. Excepting those absolutely necessary to defend the fort, I need every spare rifle out here at Dodger City, best possible speed. Is that clear, Over?"

Major Wagoner: C> "Yes, General! Our ETA is about sixteen hours and thirty minutes. Any further orders, General? Over."

K: C> "Yes, Major. I want it made absolutely clear that my communications procedures are to be followed at all times - and only a direct order from myself can countermand them. Alpha Actual, out."

It was a consolidation of power, yes, but it was necessary. If something happened to the Princesses, I knew they'd buckle and send orders they didn't want.

Right now, I needed horsepower. And in sixteen hours, that's what I'd get.
