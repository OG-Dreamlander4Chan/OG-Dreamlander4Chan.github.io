Part 1: "A Pony Named Sacquet"

TIME: 11:42 QEST
DATE: War Day 468/17 Septimus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Foreign Legion Fort, Region Nord, Republique du Quirtbeck.

Sacquet: "Colonel Phillipe Jean Sacquet, ^Marechal^ K." He bowed his head slightly.

Yes, I was referred to as Marshal K, here, not General K. My official title in Equestria was "General-Field Marshal." In Prance, instead of shortening it to General, they shortened it to Marshal.

K: "Good to meet you, Colonel. What unit is this?" I nodded to the groups of Griffons and Ponies in the small fort.

Sacquet: "Legion Command Group 'North Great Forest,' ^Marechal^, or ^Groupe de la L‚gion 'Nord Grande Forˆt'^ as we would say in Prench. Shorthand to GL-NGF." He nodded to the wooden trunks driven into the ground. "The forest, she gives us many good trees to build with." He nodded to the piles of lumber that were stacked near the lumber mill.

K: "Your English is excellent." I commented.

Sacquet: "Thank you, ^Marechal^ - I did two years University in Ambleion." He shrugged. "And my father is a well-known merchant. So, I learned a few languages, growing up around that."

K: "How are the men taking to the new weapons?" I nodded to the emplacements.

I was referencing the AA.1 and AA.2 machine guns that Prance had developed - the AA.1 fired the standard 7mm NEIGHTO round, while the AA.2 fired the 11mm round. The AA.3 was an anti-aircraft version of the AA.2, while the AA.4 was the first properly designed Pegasus Fighter Machine Gun Harness - it strapped two AA.1's on either side of the body, with an ammo belt container around the chest. The guns were jaw-activated. All the Fighter had to do was bite down, and the guns fired.

Sacquet: "Well enough. Their training is proceeding, but they are green. Inexperienced. We all are." He gave a half shrug. "I was elevated to Colonel ahead of many other officers.. apparently, command thinks I have what it takes. I intend to prove their faith in me, ^Marechal^." He gave a confident half-snort.

K: "With an attitude like that, I'm sure you will. It's wise to understand one's own limitations."

The Artillery was unlimbering their guns and getting them set up. The artillery pieces were all the new 76mm guns. Four of the older 75mm guns were emplaced in the fort as turret guns.

Dr. Allcome: "A pleasure to meet you, Colonel!" He nodded and stuck out his hoof.

Colonel Sacquet: "Doctor." He bowed his head and shook hooves, before looking back to me. "As I understand, Her Royal Highness, Crown Princess Escargot has granted you command of our force, here."

K: "Indeed she has." I handed him my Royal Decree. "With your permission, Colonel."

Colonel Sacquet: "Granted, ^Marechal.^"

K: "Dusty!" I ordered, and she was RIGHT there.

Dusty: "Yes, General?" She tilted her head.

K: "This isn't an enviroment you're familiar with, is it?" I asked, plainly.

Dusty: "No, sir. I'm more at home in the desert, mountains, or a city." She shrugged.

K: "Then you stay next to Staff Sergeant Bella Donna and Captain Havoc. They know the woods. Learn from them. Remember, specialization is for insects!" I insisted.

Dusty: "You got it, sir." Off she took.

K: "Colonel. How many troops under our command?" I asked as we walked into the fort.

Colonel Sacquet: "Seventy two, myself included. One overstrength company." He nodded. "It leaves me little, save what is required to contruct this fort." He cast a hoof at the walls. "We only began our construction two months ago. There was a Trading Post here, but it is gone, now. There are fur trappers up in these woods, by the rivers and streams, and gold panners. They, too, need supply. But, when we arrived two and a half months ago, we found nothing. No bodies, no.. how you say? Detrius. Just one empty log cabin, and a few essentials that are quite heavy. Anvil, some tools, things of that nature." He shrugged. "The train runs to the railhead, normally, one time a month. That was a week ago. I had sent a messenger to relay the message that Tirek's forces were here, and help was needed."

K: "How do you know?" I asked. "I mean, for sure. I'm not doubting your assessment, but, many of Tirek's past attacks had troops scattered everywhere. Some were simply missing. I'm asking how you're certain these aren't left behind rabble?"

Sacquet: "^CAPORAL!^ Bring the bodies, Mon Ami!" He shouted to an enlisted Griffon.

Sure enough, five Duregars were brought out and laid out on stretchers. Dead. With new equipment pouches and slightly updated, clearly newer uniforms than the ones that had been worn by the attack force from Marelin. This ruled out left-behind rabble.

K: "Point. You're right. Have you found the main force, or an encampent or anything?" I asked, looking them over.

Sacquet: "Non. But.." He shrugged. "..we have found evidence that they are watching us. The men have seen strange figures in the woods at night." He gestured. "We are certain they plan to attack us."

K: "Wonderful." I shrugged. "This is the last thing we needed." I shook my head. "Gilda!"

Gilda: "What'cha need, K?" She leaned against a post, giving me a look.

K: "This is Colonel Sacquet." I nodded to him. "Take your scouts, start a spiral search pattern. Pairs. You and Dash, Gorcat and Flutters. Go as far out as you can. I need intelligence. Any sign of these things. Footprints, bivouac sites, supply drops, anything." I shook my head. "And any other hazards."

Sacquet: "It seems, Mon Ami, flight is the one gift you lack, oui?" He tilted his head at me.

K: "If I could fly, everyone'd be in trouble." I chuckled.

Gilda took off, grabbed her team, and took flight.

K: "Colonel. Whomever isn't helping build up the fort in some way, divert them to patrol work. I'd like six Griffons or Pegasi. Your six best flyers. I'm going to form them into a Scout Squad." I looked around. "My ponies will handle the walls. We have infantry coming in a week, and a full Battalion a few days after that. For the time being, I want patrols. I want intelligence. I need to know what I'm dealing with." I gestured. "It may be that the Fort is indefensible. Depends on what we're up against."

Sacquet: "Oui, mon ami." He nodded surely and took off.

Havoc: "What'cha want us to do?" He looked up at me.

K: "You're a fireteam. Start setting traps, Canidan style." I nodded.

Havoc: "You got it." Off he took, with Bella Donna and Dusty.

This was going to be interesting. The artillery finished setting up the guns, in a loose formation, and not dug in, just in case they needed to shift fire. That was an advantage of lighter artillery pieces - they could be manhandled into different positions fairly easily. And with Earth Ponies doing the lifting, this was pretty easy.

I was still thinking about making a larger piece, though. Something in the four inch/105mm range, as was standard on Earth. It would depend on whether we needed such a thing - heavier guns. I'd probably make them some kind of Self-Propelled Gun, simply because the 76mm gun was about the largest size these ponies could handle without mechanized support.

That would requre Diesel engines, which the Crystal Kingdom had, though they were rather large. And lots of Diesel fuel. Hundreds of thousands of gallons. Which meant refineries. Which meant drilling lots of oil. Which meant... a lot of things.

At least I was at the fort. We could take our time, somewhat, and figure out our next move.

And Tirek's.

[End of Part 1]

Part 2: Deux

TIME: 12:12 QEST
DATE: War Day 468/17 Septimus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: GL-NGF Fort, Region Nord, Republique du Quirtbeck.

Lunch time. As was Prench tradition, Officers dined separately from Enlisted. My senior staff dined with Sacquet and his officers. His staff, in rank order, was Captain-Major Deudonne LeFaucheux, his second-in-command and leader of 1st Platoon, Captain Henri Brogard, leader of 2nd Platoon, Lieutenant Julianne La Selle, chief of Logistics, and Sous-Lieutenant Gorton (a Griffon), leader of 3rd Platoon. Unlike Equestria, Prench platoons were commanded directly by an officer, seconded by an NCO, and then had ten Enlisted under them. When split into Squads, the Officer took one, and the NCO took the other. The senior-most NCO was generally in the HQ Squad, while the senior-most Corporal commanded the Reserve Squad. They had a full 60-soldier Company plus 12 extra personnel organized into a Logistics Platoon.

I felt this led to a bloated Officer Corps at the expense of an NCO Corps, but the Prench historically didn't place as much responsibility on NCO's as they did Officers. So, for them, this made sense.

We had roast turkey and wild pig as the main course. Of course, Gorcat and I were very pleased. The rest.. ehh.. I could see Gaze eyeing the salad.

Sacquet: "Marechal, my officers." He nodded to them. "Captain-Major LeFaucheaux, Captain Brogard, Lieutenant La Selle, and Sous-Lieutenant Gorton.."

Gorcat: "..Uncle?" He tilted his head.

S.Lt. Gorton: "Nephew." He nodded coldly.

Gorcat: "Been years." He nodded back. "How's Auntie?"

S.Lt. Gorton: "Passed." He shrugged. "Joined the Prench. She died in Marelin." He cleared his throat.

K: "Dragon?" I asked, knowing this was how Griffons kinda acted.

S.Lt. Gorton: "Yes, Marshal." He delivered that without a Prench accent. "Understand you killed it?" He asked.

I shrugged.

K: "It was a team effort. I'm sorry for the loss of your Mate." Was all I could say.

S.Lt. Gorton: "Tirek will pay." He nodded to me, formally. "I can't wait to hear how you do it." He gave me a very Griffonically cruel smirk.

Gorcat: "It was before.. uhm.. He.." He couldn't find the words.

K: "Gorcat is redeeming himself. He's seen the light. He was running around with an outcast thug gang, got wounded by my troops before the war started, and ran off. He ended up in the Crystal Kingdom before it was freed. He likened it to Drachma..." I actually pronounced it with a Griffonic accent.

S.Lt. Gorton: "I was the leader of the Gorelon Clan at one point, until Goreham unseated me. I went to Germaneigh after that, worked as a bricklayer, with my Mate. I was away in Prance when.." He looked at his plate, then me. "..if you feel Gorcat deserves Redemption, then.."

K: "I trust him with my life." I stated, firmly. "He's a member of my staff, now." I shrugged. "Warrant Officer Gorcat, Aerial Scouting Advisor." I looked at him, as he WAS wearing an Equestrian uniform.

S.Lt. Gorton: "Glad to hear he turned his life around." He nodded. "Drachma, you say?"

K: "Either that or Tarjas, depending on how you see it. I think it's closer to Drachma, seeing as how he's escaped and earned a second chance at Hidora." Again, I used a Griffonic accent for this.

Sacquet: "Your inflections are amazingly good, Marechal!" He smiled a bit.

K: "I have a gift for languages, mon ami Sacquet." And I used a Prench accent, here.

He just grinned broadly.

K: "So.. Prench tradition for Officer's Lunch - do we mix business with pleasure?" I asked.

Sacquet: "Generally, it is impolite - bad for the digestion, no? But, I shall make an exception, as we are.. in dire straits." He shrugged. "Wine, Marechal?"

K: "Never." I waved him off. "I understand a glass of good wine is Prench tradition with a good meal, but it's not something I like. Coffee, though, would be appreciated." I looked to the servant, who indeed poured me some Prench Roast coffee.

Sacquet: "I shall be plain. Though we have spent two months on this fort, we have had difficulties. While the forest, she is generous with good timber, we have had problems engineering the fort itself. We spent over a week on one wall, only to have it collapse from unstable ground we did not realize was there. So, we had to move the entire location of the fort.. then we had bad rains for a week, and some of the men were ill after that. We arrived here with only basic equipment - myself, LeFaucheaux, and Brogard are regular army officers, while the rest of the troops are Legion." He shrugged, and continued. "The Legion is rarely properly equipped. We had axes, yes, but many were dull and we hadn't a way to sharpen them until last month. We had saws.. half were rusted. Our arms.. we have Patton rifles reconfigured to fire the 7mm NEIGHTO round. They function, but demand much attention." He gestured. "Hence why the fort is unfinished."

K: "Sounds like a challenge." I gestured. "What did you do before the war, Colonel?"

Sacquet: "I was an engineer. Primarily for construction.." He looked out at the walls. "..I was used to having my land already inspected and graded.. it was my error, I confess." He shook his head.

K: "You learned, right?" I tilted my head.. this wild boar was great.

Sacquet: "Indeed, Marechal." He nodded. "I did a complete survey myself to determine the best locations for the walls." He shrugged. "Foalish of me to think they had done this already when they handed me the blueprints."

K: "Live and learn, Colonel. War is different from Peace. In Peace, we take every step with care, sureness, and safety. In war? We cut corners and get the job done any way we can."

Sacquet: "Indeed we do, mon ami." He nodded slowly.

K: "I'll do my best to teach you and your officers how to fight tactically. Rarity, you shadow Captain-Major LeFaucheaux. Gaze, you shadow Lieutenant La Selle. Norfy, you've got Captain Brogard. Gilda, you and Gorcat with Sous-Lieutenant Gorton." I directed. "My staff officers will give your officers advice.." I gestured. "They can learn as they work and fight. These are some of my most experienced officers and troops."

Sacquet: "Indeed, Marechal!" He grinned. "A fine idea. A teacher and a student, no?"

K: "Something like that - these are still their units, their troops. My officers might be there to teach, but your officers know your troops - what they can, can't, will, and won't do." I nodded. "So, it's a two-way street." I gestured with my fork. "And I? Will shadow you."

Sacquet: "Of course, Marechal." He nodded with a small grin.


TIME: 13:35 QEST

We wouldn't have to wait long for some action. A bit after lunch, while the men were relaxing some and getting ready for the afternoon work shift (14:00 to 18:00), we got something.

Havoc came running up - he, Bella and Dusty had been out in the woods this whole time, setting traps. Bella and Dusty were right behind him.

Havoc: "Duregars!" He hissed, and nodded back to the woods, by the section of wall that wasn't finished, and protected only by stacked lumber instead of driven timbers. "Company strength, foragers." He finished.

Dusty: "I'm the one that spotted them while pulling security for Havoc and Bella Donna." She nodded. "They're scouring the woods for anything useful or edible. Some are armed with crossbows only. Others have Zhukovs. They're led by a Raptorian officer with a Lee and a sword."

K: "Good equipment assessment, Dusty." I nodded to her.

Dusty: "Thank you, sir!" She nodded back with a grin.

K: "Colonel, I need two platoons." I looked to the side, towards him. "Havoc, go get the girls and the guys."

Havoc: "Right!" And off he dashed.

Sacquet: "Only two? Eh. As you wish, Marechal." He went over to Captain-Major LeFeauchaux, and instructed him. "First and third platoons, fall in with full arms. Second platoon and Logistic Platoon remain here."

K: "Have them set up for a defense, right at the gap." I looked over for the Detrot Artillery Commander, Captain Snowy Parfait.

Snowy: "We're ready when you are." She nodded.

Norfy: "Snowy." He nodded. "We're ready, too, K."

I realized that Snowy was a Unicorn.. as was Norfy. I looked between them.

Snowy: "We used to date." She shrugged. "Still friends."

Norfy: "WE were in LOOOOVE!" Googly-eyes, and Snowy laughed.

K: "You told her!" I smirked.

Norfy: "As she said, friends." He gestured.

K: "Get ready to follow. You, Gaze, Coz, Havoc, Bella, and Dusty." I looked at Rarity. "Sniper Position, keep us covered." Then to Fluttershy and Dash. "Grenade support. I call, you drop."

Dash: "You got it!" She nodded.

K: "Jade, Gorcat." I looked to them. "Backup. Things go wrong, I want that company of Duregars smothered in gunfire and magic."

Jade: "Ohhh.. I see how it is! Now you need ME to pull your human fat from the fire!" She struck a cocky pose. "No problem."

I looked back to Sacquet.

K: "I lead from the front, Colonel. Follow me." I nodded to him.

Sacquet: "Of course." He drew his pistol, the PA-MAC P1, which resembled the French Mle 1950 to a degree, and came up to my rear.

K: "No rifle?" I asked.

Sacquet: "We have enough to arm the enlisted." He shrugged. "I did not know officers should carry them.."

K: "Always." I nodded. "Arm yourself the same as your men. Thirty pistol bullets are a sorry substitute for 120 rifle bullets." Four magazines was considered a standard load, here.

Sacquet: "Point taken." He shrugged.

I took the lead of my command team, as we eased into the woods ahead of both Legionnaire platoons. Havoc directed us to the pathway the Duregars were following. We could hear them to our left.

I pointed to First Platoon, and indicated they should be in front, down a small slope. Third platoon, with the AA.1 machine guns, should be above them. I indicated where both Machine Gun teams should set up. Legionnaire Weapon Platoons were different than Equestrian - there were three Machine Guns, each with three Ponies, then three more ponies acted as ammo carriers, but were also armed with an Armbrust rocket launcher and spare rockets, as well as having one Pony a dedicated grenade launcher, with a copied Knox, here called the LaFayette. The last pony carried only a pistol, and was an NCO.

They set up, and I made some fast notes about how they should have a long arm available to the other ponies in the Machine Gun teams (Assistant Machine Gunners had only pistols, and the Team Ammo Carrier had a sub-machine gun, in this case, a Zhukov).

Our victims came around the bend obediently. The ones armed with Crossbows had some meat over their shoulders - dead birds, small hoglets, pheasant, and the like. The Raptorian was wearing a proper uniform jacket and pants, as well as "boot-leggings" that left his talons exposed, but covered his toes. The remaining Duregar were armed with Zhukov copies.

I touched my nose, and looked to Rarity, then indicated my wrist, a signal to disable him without killing him. I pulled Sacquet over to me.

K: "Go tell your machine gun teams not to fire until Rarity does." I harshly whispered into his ear, and pushed him towards his troops.

I rested on a knee, and pointed to the Duregars with Zhukovs, and indicated to my team that those were our job. First Platoon would, hopefully, be smart enough to clean up the rest. I gave Rarity a thumb's up.. her go.

It was a moment's wait. The Officer stopped, and pulled a waterskin from his belt, and took a long drink...

*KRACK-Ooooowww*

His arm blew apart. An 11mm round WILL do that!

K: "FIRE!" I commanded, as I raised my C-7 Bradley and pulled the trigger.

We hosed those bastards down before most of them realized what was going on. Short, controlled bursts into the ranks of the ones carrying Zhukovs. The Legionnaires in First Platoon opened fire on the ones in the rear, with crossbows, as they were close enough to them to present a serious threat. The machine gun teams just raked the lines, and before the Duregars could scramble to cover, most of them were dead.

The few that were left were behind some logs on the far side of the path..

K: "ARMBRUST!" I pointed at the logs.

Legionnaire: "OUI, MON MARECHAL!"

*FWASHOOOM!!!*     *KRA-BLAMMM!!*

And that was that. We barely took any return fire.

K: "Sacquet, do a head count. HAVOC! GET ME THAT OFFICER! Gaze, Norf, get a detail together and take those Zhukovs. We'll need them." I nodded, and pointed, then walked over to Sacquet.

Sacquet: "One pony wounded, a crossbow bolt to the foreleg." He shrugged. "None shot."

K: "And that's how it should be. That was a perfect ambush." I gestured. "While they had superior numbers, they lacked equipment. They were in the open, we had cover. In this way, you can take out superior numbers of enemy troops."

Sacquet: "Ah. I would not have considered this." He shrugged. "I would have put my infantrie on the road, and machine guns to both sides of it. A roadblock." He motioned.

K: "Mm.. and confronting them directly would have caused casualties, as their proper weapons were in the front of the formation. The ones at the rear would have had time, also, to escape." I tilted my head, and gestured with my hands.

Havoc: "K! WE'RE NOT DONE!" He came running back with the prisoner under one leg.

K: "Report." I nodded, moving to cover.

Havoc: "Two companies with equipment heading this way along the same road." He indicated. "They have APC's with.. he called them Rhino Horns."

K: "Probably dozer blades designed to clear underbrush." I shrugged. "Get the Walkers. COSMIC!" I called.

Cosmic: "YEA!" He called back from his fighting position.

K: "I NEED TWO OF THE SEVENTY-SIXES DOWN HERE LOADED WITH BALLISTIC CAP!" I called back. "Colonel, move your machine gun team over there, facing the other edge of the slope."

Sacquet: "Roger!" He nodded.

Havoc handed him a Zhukov and a bandolier.

Havoc: "You might need this!" He said to Sacquet, as he dropped the Raptorian at my feet, and he, Dusty and Bella ran back for the fort.

I grabbed up the Raptorian, and gripped his blown-off stub of a limb tightly.

K: "Goal! Manpower!"

Raptorian: *SQUAAAKK!* "GET BENT, HYOOMIN!" He tried to peck me!

I slapped him several times in the face and beak and drove my knee into his breadbasket.

Raptorian: *GWARK!* "We gather food! I know nothing else! ASK THE FORT OFFICERS!" It winced and grabbed at its blwon-off stump, now.

K: "Who's IN CHARGE!?" I demanded.

Raptorian: "TUSKEGOR!" He retorted.

I had.. no idea who that was. A new enemy? Interesting. I considered this as I bound the Raptorian up tightly, and tied its beak shut.

K: "Everyone, to cover!" I hissed as I got into position behind a large rock.

The formation didn't take long to arrive. My 76mm guns were set up behind the machine gunners, hidden in bushes. I trusted Cosmic to pick targets for them, being my Artillery expert.

There was a Command Car APC in front. It stopped, and so did the formation, around the bend and not in line-of-sight of our carnage.

A creature got out that looked like Lostshort. He was wearing a formal uniform, complete with ribbons. He also had a monocle, and a peaked cap. I took him for a senior officer - not field grade. This did, however, confirm Tirek's presence.

Senior Officer: "Me Headman order you all, sit down. Rest break ten minutes." He instructed.

Excellent.

I waited for the APC crews to get well clear of their vehicles. I hoped to be able to take "Headman" alive for questioning.

Problem is, this formation of Duregars were all armed with Zhukovs, and they had Porcine with them, toting Pershings. Apparently, Tirek found my early designs "good enough" that no upgrade, to him, seemed important. THAT was good, interesting news.

I pointed to the Armbrust crew and then to the rear APC. Havoc, Bella, and Dusty had Walkers. I pointed to the first three Combat APC's, and gave Cosmic the hand signal - he had four APC's left to pick from.

Steady.. steady...

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Ambush Assault

TIME: 13:53 QEST
DATE: War Day 468/17 Septimus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: 100m from GL-NGF Fort, Region Nord, Republique du Quirtbeck.

K: "FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!" I ordered, loudly, hurriedly.

I heard all the Rocket Launchers fire at almost the same instant. They streaked across the terrain, and hit their marks. The 76mm guns were next.

Cosmic: "ROUNDS OUT!"

Both fired at the same instant, so, I'm sure it was a surprise for Headman when two of his four remaining APC's blew up.

K: "COSMIC! TAKE THE LAST TWO! EVERYONE ELSE, OPEN FIRE!"

Our opening salvo knocked a lot of the enemy off their feet, and out of their calm, throwing them into disarray. Headman panicked and dove behind a tree. He then leaned out and took pot shots at the woods with a copied Lee pistol.

Our Machine Gun section started hosing down the enemy lines, though they weren't prioritizing the enemy machine gunners.. probably doctrinal. I'd have to fix that.

K: "DASH! GRENADE THE MACHINE GUNS! RARITY!" I screamed as loud as I could.

Sure enough, grenades started landing on the Machine Gunner Porcines, and their heads started popping. The Duregars had a bad enough time, trying to fire back from little cover, caught on the road.

Headman: "ALL FALL BACK TO WOODS! FALL BACK! FALL BACK!"

He said this as his APC's machine guns opened up on us, which is the same amount of time Cosmic needed to reload the 76's. The APC's spattered the woods blindly with machine gunfire. Both 76's fired, and both APC's were blown, one of them losing its turret, which landed on five Duregars, and crushed them.

Cosmic: "RELOAD WITH AYCH-EE!" He ordered. "FIRE ON THE WOODS, FAR SIDE!" I could hear him direct the guns.

I started picking targets and shooting, my role in directing the troops unneeded at this point. We scattered the enemy, and they were dug in. We'd have to blast them out. My officers knew this - especially Cosmic.

K: "SACQUET! HOLD POSITION! KEEP THE ENEMY PINNED DOWN! RIFLEPONIES, PRECISE SHOTS ONLY!" Okay, I had to make sure that Sacquet didn't give in to Prench egosim and zeal..

He didn't. Wise. He held his ponies back, and engaged targets carefully. I noticed that the Legionnaires were having problems with their rifles, and after a couple magazines, every other man had to stop firing to help clear jams.

Not good. I slid back, taking a few peppering shots aimed imprecisely at my general location and ran up to Cosmic's position.

K: "Cosmic, the Prench are having trouble maintaining fire superiority. Load rounds fast, and throw them out there. I'm going to get another Section of guns." I nodded.

Cosmic: "Got it." He looked at the gun crews. "Rapid fire!"

With that, I ran back towards the fort. Once inside, I called to Snowy.

K: "SNOWY! GET ME ANOTHER SECTION OF GUNS!" I yelled, running up to her.

Snowy: "Problems, General?" She looked to the side. "SECOND SECTION, FIRST WAGON TRAIN, FORM UP TO REINFORCE!"

K: "The Prench weapons are jamming. Not the Machine Guns, the Rifles." I shrugged. "I think the 7mm conversions were done poorly.." I trailed off as the reinforcements came up. "YOU LOT! ON ME! MOVE!"

With that, we moved back to the fight with a quickness.

K: "Second section! Set up right here!" I indicated a small dip in the terrain that formed a short, natural trench. "Wagon Train, resupply Third Section!" I directed, and got back to the main battle. "Norfy!"

Norfy: "Enemy's dug in, but taking casualties. The Prench are, too, sir. Their rifles are failing at about the same rate we kill enemy troops." He shrugged.

K: "DASH!" I called up, and she came down next to me.

Dash: "What'cha need?"

K: "Mark all the enemy positions with smoke shells. Then fly to Cosmic and point second and third arty towards them." I directed.

Off she took, with Gilda next to her.

After a few minutes, I saw smoke coming from different parts of the woods next to the trail. Dash zoomed past me, and landed by Cosmic, relaying instructions.

Gorcat and Jade joined me at that point.

K: "Gorcat, keep their heads down!" I pointed. "Jade.. obscure us." Time to mix Science and Magic.

Jade: "Okay.."

She pulled out a pair of green Gems about the size of her fist, and cast them into the sky. A warbly field erected itself in front of us, going clear but slightly frosted on our side.

Jade: "From their perspective, the whole hillside looks like frosted glass. Suppresses bright lights good, too." She cockily swayed her hips a bit.

Gorcat just started gunning at them, Rambo style. One handing the Abrams, and one handing the belt. And laughing.

The incoming fire almost immediately lost all accuracy. Not that it had much to begin with.

K: "SACQUET! WITHDRAW ALL TROOPS WITH NONWORKING WEAPONS! REDEPLOY THE ONES THAT CAN SHOOT!" I directed.

Sacquet: "OUI, MON MARECHAL!" He replied.

I watched as about two thirds of the Legionnaires withdrew, also carrying their wounded. This was worse than I thought. From one half, to two thirds?

At least the Artillery was cleaning things up real good.

It was all over a few minutes later. The last enemy soldiers fell dead with precise rifle fire from my team. Rarity came up to me, and placed her Hathcock down beside her.

Rarity: "All empty, darling. Well timed, that was my last bullet." She shrugged.

I moved over, with her, to Sacquet, finding him tying off a fleshwound on his upper left foreleg.

K: "Let me give you a hand with that." I said, reassuringly.

I knelt down, and pulled out my IFAK (Individual First Aid Kit), putting some antiseptic on his bandage, and applying it properly. Tied off, I patted him on the other shoulder.

K: "You and your men did just fine." I nodded. "I'm guessing you had the rifles handed to the best shots you had left, yes?" I tilted my head.

Sacquet: "As best I could, mon ami." He shrugged one-armedly.

K: "We'll need to talk about that." I looked to Rarity. "Get our team together, scour the enemy lines. Take some Legionnaires, police the enemy weapons and ammo. They'll need them."

Rarity: "On it, Darling." She sauntered off, then trotted.

Sacquet: "She is... most pleasing to the eye, mon ami." He grinned as he watched her trot away.

K: "An ass man, I see." Not that ponies really had boobs.

Sacquet: "Eh-!? OH! Mon ami! Please! Not in public, yes?" He looked a bit embarrassed.

K: "Come on, we're all bros, here. Besides, Equestrians don't have the same class divides that you're used to, so, we're freer about discussing such things." I shrugged. "She's incredible in bed." I grinned. "Applejack sent her.. my wife, that is.. to make sure I stay out of trouble." I smirked.

Sacquet: "Sacre bleu, mon Marechal!" He snorted a bit at me.

K: "Hey, I speak my mind." I shrugged. "She likes it. How's the arm? Er, leg."

I asked that as Sweetheart came up to check on the rest of us.

Sacquet: "Some pain, but.."

Nurse Sweetheart: "Any damage, this time?" She asked as she checked me over. "Not a SCRATCH? Huh!" She then went to Sacquet. "Hm.. flesh wound. Nothing serious."

K: "I get hurt a lot." I shrugged.

Sacquet: "I see..." He rubbed his chin with his unwounded fetlock.

Rarity: "K! YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SEE THIS!"

The mystery deepens...

Part 4: More Questions than Answers

TIME: 14:12 QEST
DATE: War Day 468/17 Septimus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: 170m from GL-NGF Fort, Region Nord, Republique du Quirtbeck.

I was standing over the dead enemy with Rarity. Legionnaires were collecting weapons from the corpses. Rarity handed me a copied Walker RPG.

Rarity: "They've advanced. And we haven't any armored vehicles in production, yet." She shrugged.

Gilda and Gorcat brought me Headman. He was a Goblin, just like Lostshort. He was also battered and had numerous small cuts.

Gilda: "Grenade shell landed right by him. Knocked him clean out." She shrugged.

K: "Name?" I asked him.

Headman: "Headman!" He hissed at me.

K: "Your proper name, not your position." I stated.

Headman: "Grabbler." He stated, less aggressively.

K: "Grabbler. Are you a Goblin?" I may as well make sure.

Grabbler: "Yeeess.. we goblin." He gave me a very.. evil little smirk.

K: "Wonderful. Does your entire race willingly follow Tirek?" I tilted my head.

Grabbler: "Tirek bring'd us up from the Beyond Place. We just morons! Idiot! He make us smart, he make us strong." A broadening grin. "He give us power.. even over big piggies."

K: "Keep his arms restrained." I instructed.

Gorcat: "We have his hands in anti-magic mittens. Something Twilight cooked up and gave to Gilda." He shrugged.

K: "Cute." I looked back to him. "What of the Duregars?"

Grabbler: "Ohh.. they just dummies. Tirek take cursed Grundle, make them many!" He giggled a little. "Tirek have maaannyyy friends! He learn! He say he learn! Hyoominz teach'd him to make maaanyyy friends! Then make unstoppable!" He chuckled.

K: "Something funny?" I raised my head.

Grabbler: "IT TICKLE!" He belly laughed.

K: "BOMB! BOMB! THROW HIM HARD! EVERYONE, GET DOWN!"

Gorcat grabbed him away from Gilda, and heaved the little shit as hard as he could, then pushed her to the ground.

The Goblin landed amongst the bodies from the first ambush, still paralyzed by laughter, then he detonated with the force of a 500lbs bomb. It rocked the woods but good.

K: "Everyone okay?!" I yelled out.

Gilda: "GIT! Offa mee!" She heaved into Gorcat, and tossed him away.

Gorcat: "Well excuse the fuck outta me!" He crossed his arms after standing up.

Dash: "Heh.. my G don't need savin'!" She smirked.. and I gave her tail a tug.

K: "They're flirting, Dash. She may be with you, but this is a Griffon that'll give her the time of day. Let her enjoy it!" I put a hand on her shoulder. "Besides, you fooled around with me - and no, that's not different. If you want to be a mother of some kind and marry Gilda, one of you will have to mate with a male of your own species." I spoke in low tones as Gilda and Gorcat gave each other a few more verbal barbs.

Dash looked thoughtful for a moment until Rarity interrupted us.

Rarity: "Anyway, Darling.. we've recovered their weapons. Shall we salvage the APC's?" She tilted her head.

K: "Find somepony that knows mechanics. Yes, tear them down and see if we can make at least one working APC. We'll use the armored plates from the others as stand-off armor to protect against RPG's."

Which meant that once Tirek learned that trick, I'd have to invent Tandem Warheads.. fuck me.

I made my way back to Sacquet and Captain-Major LeFaucheaux.

K: "What's with this.." I picked up a discarded, jammed rifle. "..this shouldn't be happening. I designed the operating systems myself."

Sacquet: "Oui. But. They were from the stock of Patton rifles given to Prance. When we developed the FA-MASE, the Legion was upgraded from crossbow and lance.. to these. These were first given to the Prench Army in original 6.5mm caliber. We received these.. rearsenalled to 7mm NEIGHTO." He shrugged.

K: "Where was the work done?!" I started stripping the weapon.

Sacquet: "At the Chauchat factory." He shrugged. "In Saint Chamond."

K: "Funny. That's a cursed name in my world, too." I shrugged as I examined the parts.

My fine work creating an operating system was, as I saw, monkeyfucked to the nine hells. The gas port was overbored and misaligned by angle, the short stroke gas piston was replaced with a cast model that was much thicker. The piston collar that led to the chamber was NOT bored out to accomodate this, and as a result, the piston had an incredibly tight fit.

K: "No wonder these things jammed. They're improperly re-engineeed." I shrugged. "Whoever did this conversion is an idiot."

Capt-Maj LeFaucheaux: "..my BROTHER did zis conversion, mon Marechal!" He snorted at me.

K: "Your brother is an idiot." I looked him dead in the eyes.

Capt-Maj LeFaucheaux: "HOW DARE YOU!" He stood up to me. He was about Mac's size.

K: "I stand by my words. Your brother had no business mucking about with something he clearly did not understand. The result is a weapon that only functions under optimal conditions, not battlefield ones. In any kind of heat, this cast piston would swell up anyway, and jam the rifle. So, either this defective piece of equipment is horribly re-engineered by someone who had no idea what they were doing.. or this was sabotage, to give the Legion the worst weapons possible and get them killed." I spoke plainly, evenly.

I didn't notice Rarity, Dash, and Fluttershy were at my back.

Capt-Maj LeFaucheaux: "ZIS IS AN INSULT!" He yelled in my face. "COLONEL! I DEMAND SATISFACTION!" He turned to his superior.

Sacquet: "He demands a duel, mon Marechal. And you have given him reason - you have impeached the reputation of his brother, a respected engineer." He shrugged.

K: "Fine, if you want to be a big baby about it. I refuse to apologise." I got right up in his face.

LeFaucheaux did what I expected. He took his white forehoofcap from his belt with his teeth, and slapped me across the face with it.

LeFaucheaux: "I CHALLENGE YOU TO A DUEL!" He demanded.

K: "Sabers." I nodded.

LeFaucheaux: "You are a fool. Thirty minutes, main courtyard of the fort."

K: "My doctor will be Code Allcome. My seconds will be Gorcat, Rarity, and Havoc." I stated.

LeFaucheaux: "I see you know zee ruels, Marechal." He sniffed. "As we lack a second doctor, I must select our company medic. My seconds will be Lieutenant Le Salle, Sous-Lieutenant Gorton, and Sergent-major chef (Chief Sergeant Major) La Botte." He snorted a bit.

K: "Colonel?" I didn't look at him.

Sacquet: "We permit duels of honor among.. the officers.. oui. I accept the terms, as commander." He shrugged. "Mon Marechal.."

I waved him off. I knew the other officers probably questioned my dedication and honor as it was. I knew I'd have to take a Prison Mentality here, and literally beat up the biggest bully in the yard. In this case, I had a legit greivance.


TIME: 15:00 QEST
LOCATION: Courtyard of the Fort

I stood ready, hefting the Sword of Rainbow's light, and taking some practice swings.

K: "Rarity, Gorcat, Havoc.. you know why I chose you?" I asked.

Gorcat: "MMm... with me you guessed he'd pick my uncle as a Second?" He tilted his head.

Rarity: "And I'm naturally a charmer.."

Havoc: "And I'd boast about your skills.."

K: "No." I swung straight down, refamiliarizing myself with its weight. "I chose you because you represent just how diverse our alliance is. That we're all friends. That we may have racial and other differences, but we can overcome them, BE friends, and fight this war against Tirek as one united peoples." I looked at them. "You're here to inspire the others. I know the Foreign Legion from my world - if this is anything similar, there's racial tension here, even if they don't show it. And resentment for the officers." I looked over at the crowd. "..we didn't lose anyone in that fight, thankfully, but there were a lot of wounded. The enlisted want to know why, and IF, an officer or someone else 'above' them is at fault and will be held accountable. I intend to do just that."

Rarity: "Mmm.. and some wonder why Applejack fell madly in love with you, Darling." She patted my shoulder.

Gorcat: "Pretty smart." He nodded.

Havoc: "That and you trust us." He added.

K: "I do. I trust each of you with my life." I looked at Dr. Allcome. "Not gonna lie, I'm going to be bleeding after this."

Dr. Allcome: "Most certainly, K. But, I understand now why you feel you have to go through with this." He nodded solemnly.

K: "Alright. You three step forwards and talk with his seconds. Make it clear that I stand by my mechanical analysis of the converted Pattons and lay the blame at his brother's feet. I will not apologize for facts. I offer no restitution. I ask that he accept that his brother is, in fact, to blame for the poor quality of the weapons. Don't argue about it, just be calm.."

Rarity: "Mmm.. better let me take care of this, boys. Come-come, now." She led them to the middle.

I saw LeFauchaux' seconds approach them.

The conversation was very short. Colonel Sacquet acted as a referee.

Sacquet: "BOTH PARTIES FAIL TO REACH AGREEMENT!" He stated aloud. "MARECHAL K BLAMES CAPTAIN-MAJOR LEFAUCHEAUX' BROTHER FOR THE POOR QUALITY OF OUR RIFLES. THE CAPTAIN-MAJOR DENIES HIS BROTHER WOULD MAKE SUCH FAILURES." He nodded to us both. "DUELLERS, APPROACH!"

I walked forwards to meet my challenger.

Sacquet: "Do either of you, personally, wish to concede your points?" He asked.

LeFaucheaux: "NEVER!" He spat.

K: "I refuse to apologise for my analysis of my own design being horribly re-engineered." I stated.

Sacquet: "This duel will be to first blood." He stated. "Challengers, take three steps back."

I did, and watched LeFaucheaux do the same. He drew his saber, a D-Ring sword with a muzzle guard, meant for holding in the mouth. I stood at attention, sword in front of my face, vertical.

K: "I warn you, I'm not a very good swordsman." I stated.

LeFaucheaux: "I trained at three of zee best fencing schools in Paree!" He stated.

Sacquet: "BEGIN!"

He charged me. I knew he would. I simply sidestepped him, and kept my sword ahead of me. Both of us were in A-Frame tops and trousers. Arms, of course, would be a prime target. He redirected, and kept trying to close with me. I kept stepping back.

The crowd didn't like this.. it was boring, and I was showing no backbone. There was booing, actually.

I retreated my steps, still facing him, making a circle around the center of the ring area. Good footwork.. as I only had two of them. He went from standard lunges to galloping charges, his thrusts growing more desperate.

LeFaucheaux: "WHY DO YOU NOT CROSS BLADES WISS ME?! COWAIRD!" He yelled.

K: "I'm not a good swordsman!" I retorted.

No, but I am a good strategist. I was making him get used to overextending to try and get at me.. making him create his own opening.. and then.. I stabbed at him, finally, and nicked along his left ear, and penetrated his shoulder, a bit.

Blood!

Sacquet: "THAT IS ENOUGH! MARECHAL K IS THE WINNER!" He stated.

LeFaucheaux: "NON! HE DOES NOT SATISFY ME! ZIS IS NOT DUELLING! HE RETREATS THE WHOLE TIME!" He yelled. "I WANT HIM DEAD!"

He charged me again. I had a feeling this might happen.

I jumped back, got my sword in front of me, and started deflecting his blows.

LeFaucheaux: "OUI! OUI! ZIS EES BETTARE!" He clashed with me, trying to overpower me. "FIGHT! FIGHT YOU COWAIRD!"

All I was doing was deflecting. Finally, I managed to deflect his sword with my right leg in the rear but cocked, and I simply stepped forwards and stepped on his blade, forcing it to the ground.

K: "Enough!" I stated firmly.

He responded by opening his mouth, dropping the sword, and wheeling around and kicking me in the chest.

The crowd erupted in cheers.

I landed a few feet away, my sword between me and him.

LeFaucheaux: "PITIFUL!" He stated as he trotted over to me, his sword again in his mouth.

K: "You cheated." I held my chest, trying to get up, but I found a blade pressed to my throat.

LeFaucheaux: "Your last chance, Marechal! APOLOGIZE!" He demanded.

He didn't account for the fact that my feet were under him. I kicked him in the chest.. rather, I rolled my legs under him and heaved him off.

This time, he lost HIS sword and landed a good bit away. The crowd was going crazy.

K: "YOUR BROTHER MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE!" I yelled, running and grabbing my sword. "IF YOU INSIST, YOU CAN TAKE HIS PLACE!" I held it in front of me, and kicked his mouth-sword in his direction.

He rolled on the ground a moment, then heaved himself up, grabbing his sword.

LeFaucheaux: "ZEN SO BE IT!" He charged, swinging wildly.

Thing is, the rules had rapidly broken down. I would meet but not exceed the breaking. So, when he got close enough to make contact, I blocked and kicked him in the neck as hard as I could with my left leg.

He backed off, coughing. I'd hit the windpipe.

I pressed my advantage, making hefty overhand swings, and taking advantage of my superior size to force him on the defensive. I backed off my tempo JUST a moment, to intentionally give him an opening. He took it, and reared up, attempting to stomp-tackle me with his saber out forwards.

I brought my arm up into his chest, and kicked him in the balls as hard as I could. I could hear his teabags slap against his own flanks, I'd snapped them back so hard.

LeFaucheaux: *MONDIEU!* He screamed, and fell over, clutching himself.

I walked up, kicked his sword away, and pressed the Sword of Rainbow's Light to his neck a bit firmer than he'd done to me.

K: "You're done. I spare your life." I stated.

Sacquet: "OUI! ZAT IS ENOUGH! K IS THE WINNER!" He marched over, and grabbed LeFaucheaux. "And YOU! YOU behaved in a most dishonorable fashion! I strip you of rank!" He dragged him over to his side of the field. "You are reduced to Aspirant!" He yelled at him. "YOU are no GENTLECOLT!" He continued. "And no Officer under me!" He tore off the epaulettes of LeFaucheaux' uniform with his teeth, and trotted over to me, handing them to me. "Marechal K, your trophy." He nodded.

I took them and stuck them in my pocket, and walked towards the crowd.

K: "It shouldn't have to be that a foreigner holds your betters to account! YOU deserve the BEST that Prance can give you for willing to DIE in her name!" I stated. "NOT these... insults!" I grabbed one of the converted rifles and snapped it over my knee. Damn, that hurt. "I will ensure that each Legionnaire receives proper equipment, proper arms.. and the RESPECT you deserve!"

They all cheered.

Part 5: Brothers, Sisters, All

TIME: 18:36 QEST
DATE: War Day 468/17 Septimus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: GL-NGF Fort, Region Nord, Republique du Quirtbeck.

We sat at the dinner table without LeFaucheaux. It was quiet, this meal, as we were short an officer.

Sacquet: "For a poor swordsman, you did splendid, Marechal." He nodded.

K: "Yeah, well, I got lucky that he was very aggressive and automatically disrespected my capabilities." I shrugged. "Really, I had an idea I'd have to duel one of your officers."

Sacquet: "Truly? Why?" He tilted his head at me.

Lt. Gorton: "To prove himself to us, and to the men, Colonel."

He'd been promoted to take over 2nd Platoon. 3rd Platoon was now led by Chief Sergeant Major La Botte.

K: "He's right. When I realized Gorton was Gorcat's uncle, I didn't think it'd be him. You? You're too loyal to your station, your country, and your men. There's no issue with them." I shrugged and gestured. "I thought it might be Captain Brogard or LeFaucheaux." I shrugged.

Capt. Brogard: "Oui, Mon Marechal? Why me?" He tilted his head.

K: "You're an officer from Society. It shows in how cleanly you keep yourself, how you walk, act, and behave. I had a feeling you might take issue with a former Commoner like myself being the General-Field Marshal of Equestria, and your boss." I pointed my loaded fork at him.

Capt. Brogard: "....oui.. I do have.. reservations.." He looked around the table. "However! You proved your prowess as a strategist and tactician today. I would take no argument with you, Marechal." He shrugged. "Especially seeing your.. lack.. of skill with a saber!" He chuckled at that one. "I am glad it was not me.. I do not think I would have fared as well as Deudonne." He confessed.

K: "See, you respect what I can do - but, I have a feeling, if our friends hadn't shown up and given me the chance, we would have butt heads over my alterations to your tactics and doctrine, you questioning what a man like me, with no societal education, would know about such things. How to lead troops, how to enforce discipline to the Ranks.. things like that." I said, taking a bite of wild boar.

Damn, whomever is cooking this, is doing a damn fine job. I won't be lacking protein while I'm here. Seems to be some kind of wine sauce, with the wine reduced to nothing and the sauce delicate but bitey. A touch of salt, and it made the meat delicious - honestly, the best I'd had except in Marelin.

Capt. Brogard: "...you seem to know my mind, quite well, Marechal." He cocked his head at me, wondering.

K: "No, it's more like.. I know people like you, who look down on the lowborn. Non-nobility. Or not nobility-adjacent. None of your formal schools, or societal education." I shrugged. "None of your birthright status, and the expectations that go along with it. I have none of those."

Capt. Brogard: "..oui.." He seemed reflective as he stared into his soup. "..still.."

K: "Every nation in the NEIGHTO alliance has their own problems they have to overcome. Prance and Roam were the only two that had free standing armies of any note. Both have lengthy military tradition.. and both have problems with it." I continued, now looking at Sacquet. "A lot of those traditions, I think, should be retained. Some, however, should not. If you want an effective fighting force, you can't half-ass anything. Officers should be picked for aptitude and courage, not breeding and family ties. NCO's selected for knowledge and experience, not favoritism. Equipment should be the best each nation can produce. Each soldier given the best possible - in training and gear - in respect to their willingness to die for their home nation." I looked at Brogard. "That's not to say a high borne family shouldn't intentionally set about raising their children..." To La Selle. "...of both genders..." Back to Sacquet. "...to be ready to serve in a leadership capacity. High borne, noble, aristocratic families will always have an advantage over the poor. There will always be an economic gulf. It's how that gulf is addressed that determines whether it's a weakness or a strength. The aristocratic class, however, must hold up to its end of the societal bargain if any kind of semi-feudalist system is going to work: They must be well educated in the arts of war, economics, diplomacy, and more, that they may be able, apt, and knowledgeable to lead their fellow citizens who wouldn't have such chances at education and training, when the need arises. The inevitable fools and dandies that ARE created, despite these best efforts, should be marginalized and placed somewhere they can cause no harm - even the most frilly dandy requires fine clothes and luxuries, even if they can barely balance a budget. They're not to be trusted in times of war or crisis, yet in peace, can be directed to use their aristocratic status for the betterment of others through patronage and investment." I pointed my fork at the three. "And, of course, if the aristocrat officers don't respect the lives of the people they lead or claim to be better than, then they're nothing more than despots in waiting. The kind of people that Prance's analogue in my world had a violent civil war against, and largely executed."

Rarity: "No such thing has happened here, however." She cut right in like a fine dancing partner. This was literally her tune. "What General K is saying, lady and gentlecolts, is that you must, going forwards, be prepared to give your all, so long as you wear that uniform. It's not just fashion, dearies. It's what you all wear together, enlisted and officer alike, that gives you similarity. It is a symbol of how we're all in this together, and how we must have mutual respect whilst maintaining order and discipline - the two sides not mutually exclusive. And that you, wearing the shiniest baubles, be able to lead these troops better than their enemies' own officers and aristocrats. There's nothing worse than an aristocratic house who's heir is a fool." She tilted her head.

I didn't even need to tell her she done good.

Sacquet: "I see." He nodded, in thought. "You raise good points, mon ami." He looked at the other officers. "Unlike Capitain Brogard, I was the son of a merchant. Middle class, you see. Though fortunate, as my mother was a university professor." He shrugged. "I am.. between classes. The education of an aristocrat, the culture of a merchant. Within sight of both sides above and below me. So, I take your words with weight, mon ami K."

Capt. Brogard: "I, too, can see your wisdom, Marechal." He nodded. "Being second born in my family, minor nobility, I was expected to be a military officer. I was not expected to be here - I came because I believed even the Legion deserves proper leadership. Now.. Marechal.. I question whether I indeed have the skill I thought I did.. and I'm willing to learn, under you."

Lt. La Selle: "Agreed, mes petites." She turned to look at the other officers. "Coming from a family of aristocracy myself, I was not expected to take to the Army. I was expected to be Clergy, as most third born are." She looked at me. "You, Marechal, state clearly some reasons why I did what I did, and have turned my Special Talent for organization into an asset for all of Prance."

Lt. Gorton: "I alreay knew all this. It just wasn't my place to say it, really." He shrugged. "I'm not even a Prench citizen until my term is up. I wasn't even an officer until recently - and my rank hasn't been confirmed. So.." He looked at the others. "..I'm much closer to the troops than you."

K: "Glad we got that all out of the way." I nodded. "So, we lost 14 wounded in the ambush of three enemy companies. No killed. However, two soldiers will be incapacitated for some time." I shrugged. "At least we have proper medical care for them. A supply drop from the Equestrian Air Force is expected in two days. They'll be in radio range tomorrow evening. I want to contact them, then, and arrange medical evacuation of those two cases. I also want them to send a request to the Prench High Command for a complete shipment of FA-MASE rifles for the Legion. While the AA.1 machine guns are just fine, these rifles we have are literal junk. I want them scrapped, save a dozen examples to be sent to technical institutions and museums as an example of how NOT to engineer a gas system." I tapped my fingertip on the table. "I don't like the idea of shaming a man for all time, but he brought this on himself, and his brother's dishonorable actions just make my case that this needs to be drilled into the heads of every engineer and machinist that comes after - mistakes are fine, but own up to them and fix them, don't try to bury your shame with a misplaced fight." I gestured a bit. "In the meantime, reissue the captured enemy Zhukov SMG's to everyone. While they haven't the range of a rifle, they're reliable, and we can get more ammo from the enemy if we must. We should have enough. In addition, set up any working captured Pershings along the walls. At the very least, we can use the enemy's assets against them, and have this fort bristling with guns."

Lt. La Selle: "Fantastic idea. I shall set about reissuing the captured equipment immediately." She nodded to me.

Sacquet: "And our next move?" He tilted his head, handing off his dinner plate.

K: "I'm going to put together an ad-hoc recon team, and probe the area. I absolutely want to know where this so-called fort is, its strengh, number of troops, and their goals." I shrugged hard. "If we don't know what we're facing, we can't exactly counter it, can we?"

Sacquet: "Indeed, mon ami." A sage nod.

K: "In the meantime, we're going to retrain the Legionnaires that are here. I noticed that your machine guns didn't target the biggest threats, and instead spread their fire over the entire enemy unit. That's not a good idea. Havoc, Norfy, and Gaze will teach you how we do things. Furthermore, I'm going to reorganize the Legion Company that's here. The Legion has to have two capabilites that are often in conflict with each other - light strike infantry, and occupational defensive infantry. That is, they have to be a force that can attack a target and hold it, as well as one that can eaily adapt to lightweight reconnaisence, and it all has to be organic within one company, the basic deployed force of every NEIGHTO nation."

Sacquet: "And how will you accomplish this?" He asked, taking a glass of water and leaving his wine half-finished.

K: "Simple. Each standard NEIGHTO company has five platoons. One platoon will be standard line infantry. One will be Ranger-qualified. The third will remain the Weapons Platooon. The fourth will be a Logistics Platoon capable of digging emplacements and fortifications, constructing blockhouses, and generally acting as both an Engineer squad and a Supply Transport squad. Infantry Platoon, Recon Platoon, Weapons Platoon, Logistic Platoon, HQ Platoon. There's your Legion Company." I nodded. "The extra ten remaining Legionnaires we have right now will be used as Logistics until more troops arrive. Then, we'll see what we can do. The fort still has to be finished."

Sacquet: "I see.." He nodded. "For the time being, I will have our Logistic Platoon detached and working for Lieutenant La Selle, to finish the fort. Once you are done retraining the Infantry Platoon, they will assist. The Recon Platoon can then be used to probe the area with your expert troops, and the Weapons Platoon saved to defend the fort itself."

K: "Sounds good. Very good. You're getting the hang of this." I nodded. "I'll also assign two rotating sections of gunners to help with the fort's construction. One remains on alert at all times." I gestured.

Sacquet: "Satisfactory, mon Marechal." He nodded.

K: "Also, considering what happened today, I want a unit on alert tonight, but I also want the troops to cease all other non-vital activity after supper, and rest. They've permission to sleep, if they want, until morning. We'll set up a proper shift schedule then." I looked at the assigned enlisted servers, and they did seem pleased.

Sacquet: "Alright, mon Marechal." He grinned, satisfied.

The dinner was part politics, part strategy. And Rarity was right there.. right where I needed her to be. I'd picked well to take her with.

I retired to my quarters - the former trading post was reconfigured for officers' quarters. I had a bed, a footlocker that looked recently constructed, some shelves, and a small table.

Then, Rarity came in.

Rarity: "Mmm.. cozy." She slid into my lap.

K: "See, I knew Applejack told you to keep me in the paddock." I looked down at her as she pushed me back and straddled me. "What? Afraid I'd charm some nice Prench pony?"

Rarity dove in for a kiss.

Rarity: "Something like that, darling.." She nuzzled me. "..a lady never keeps her friends waiting. And a gentleman.." She undid my pants. "..never leaves a lady unsatisfied.."

Right as Rainbow Dash came in, with a juice box in one fetlock.

Dash: "Hey, K! I scored an extra juice box, you want o-" She stopped, seeing my manhood halfway in Rarity's mouth. "Uh.. I.." And turned beet red.

Rarity: "Come." She said, pulling back, and reaching out for her. "I've yet to see just how.. awesome.. you are."
