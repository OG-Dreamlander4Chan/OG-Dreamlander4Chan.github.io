Part 1: Giant Problems

TIME: 15:02 GKT
DATE: War Day 900/24 Noneous, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Fortress of Harmony Ruins, Western Empire of Harmony


We made good time to the area we could hear the shooting from. Fortunately, the Fortress was designed like a proper fortress, not a dungeon, and had a fairly conventional layout.

We found Havoc, Seven, and their team, falling back in good order from a very large room. Moon Dancer was straining herself to hold up a magical barrier, and as we got to THAT particular hallway, I saw a large magical burst slam into Dancer's bubble, and shatter it, bowling everyone over with the kinetic feedback.

I wasted no time in slamming myself against one of the doors to that room, and shoving it with all my might, to close it. Havoc, Bella, and Seven jumped up, and got the other door, though I could tell Havoc was reeling.

K: "REPORT!" I demanded.

Seven: "It's a Frost Giant, K.. well, a Frost Giant Horse, that is." He shrugged.

Sunset: "I gotch'er back, Dancer." She helped her up. "You look exhausted!"

Moon Dancer: "UUUGH! I am! Oh, my gosh!" She was panting heavily, and visibly sweating hard. "I have NEVER used magic in that way before! I mean, I knew the spells, but.." She shook her head. "I just don't have the strength!"

Sunset: "I mean.. I'm probably lacking, now, too." She gestured. "It's been ages-"

The Frost Giant slammed into the door, almost sending me flying.

K: "You got any tricks?! USE 'EM!" I urged.

Sunset: "Well.. he's frost, I'm fire.." She nodded. "Give me a clear shot!"

Havoc: "Defensive Line! Grenaders, load H-E! Get set up to pull back in two groups for the exit!" He directed.

Little bad-ass, I was just thinking that when I met him, he was so tiny..

Rarity: "Sharpshooters! Aim for the joints if you get a shot!" She directed. "If it can't walk, it can't get us!"

K: "Ready!?" I asked.

Sunset: "READY!" She nodded, firmly, her horn glowing hot.

I let the door open, and the Frost Giant Horse's face was RIGHT in the doorway.. it was so huge, it jammed its muzzle through and the muzzle, up to the forehead, got stuck.. bastard must be 25 feet tall!

Sunset let rip with a HUGE firebolt, whipping her whole head into it, and the gigantic ball of flame slammed into the Forst Giant's nose, sending it reeling, and as it did, causing the celing and walls to buckle.

K: "ADVANCE! ADVANCE! GET THAT THING!" I drew the Sword of Rainbow's Light instinctively. "Sunset, channel through the Sword!" I advanced in, with her behind me.

Applejack: "Ah gawt'cher backs!" She was behind Sunset.

Sunset: "YEAH! TAKE THIS, FROSTY THE FUCKFACE!" She channeled another massive fire spell, and launched it into the sword.

I 'caught' the spell like a lacrosse ball, and let it launch me forwards, into the monster, and stab it. In the neck. I jumped up as I made contact, and while the beast fell away, I managed to gouge a massive hole in its neck, that bled what looked like crystalized water.

???: "ENOUGH!" Bellowed a voice.

Everything stopped (including the Frost Giant).

Out stepped a.. well, he's not as tall as Tirek, but he's tall.. eight feet? Taller than Celestia. A pony, with very interesting markings on him. Old, long beard, the works.

Helreginn: "I am Helreginn.." He looked right at me. "..and I see fate has sent The Destroyer, The Bringer of Ragnarok."

K: "Uh.. guys.. this dude's a God. More or less." I shrugged.. and the Sword of Rainbow's Light now felt like a tiny pointy stick.

Helreginn: "Perceptive." He narrowed his eyes at me.

K: "What are you doing on the mortal plane? And why care about Ragnarok?" I shrugged slightly.

Helreginn: "..you know of us, it seems." He pawed the ground.

K: "In my world, Ragnarok is pre-written history. Loki will betray, Gods will die, everyone knows the part they will play when it happens." I shrugged again, gesturing slightly. "Odin knows everything, and I suspect, it's something of an open secret. Like, nobody cares, they just wake up every day and hope it isn't today."

Helreginn: "You misunderstand. We may know it's going to happen. But, unlike you, we don't want it to happen that way." He corrected me.

K: "Really, now? Like I said, I didn't think you cared." I slowly shook my head.

Helreginn: "I am trying to prevent my death, Human!" He sneered at me.

K: "But.." I pointed to him. "..you can't kill me."

Helreginn: "No. But, unlike you, I care not for the lives of mortals." He glanced at everyone in my team. "You will come with me, and be bound lke Fenrir, for all time. This little mortal war will end.. it will take longer, but it will end." Then back to me. "..and without the Sword of Surtur!"

K: "The.." I blinked. "..Daybreaker Device!"

Helreginn: "NOOW you get it!" He pointed his hoof at me. "You are not a complete fool, it seems." And a nod. "When you use the Sword of Surtur to end your little Mortal War, you will bring Ragnarok with it!" He spat.

K: "I'm.. I'm not going to kill Tirek that way. I'm going to use the Rainbow of Light!" I nodded.

Helreginn: "FOOOOL!" He bellowed. "YOU were sent to bring DESTRUCTION! ASK yourself - what GOD gave you such a mission!?!"

K: "Galactica Spark." I frowned.

Helreginn: "And.. you will not relent from that trickster. It seems I must be more direct, then..!" He motioned to the Frost Giant. "DESTROY his allies and bring the human to me, alive!"

K: "Ohh.. you want to play THIS game?!" I moved in front of the Frost Giant. "FINE BY ME!" I raised the sword. "..you better answer, Mare." And pointed it at the Frost Giant. "GALACTICA SPARK, GIVE ME STRENGTH!"

I guessed right. The sword instantly glowed with immense power, like a lightsaber.

Applejack: "HOLY CELESTIA!" She profaned.

I could hear Galactica in my head.. telling me I needed fire to save my friends.. but she would exact a price for this.. a bit of revenge for the Tiamat thing. And all I could think about, was, I'd rather die here than let them down.

K: "SUNSET! GIVE IT ALL YOU GOT!" I called to her.

Sunset: "Ahhhhhhhh! BURN IN TARTARUS, YOU GIANT ICE CREAM BAR!" She screamed, and channeled ALL her magic into the sword.

The feedback was instant.. the light was blinding.. the ceiling peeled off the Fortress, and as Helreginn and the Frost Giant tried to flee through it, I could feel myself launched into the air, after it.

Just as predicted.

I was being propelled through the air on the wings of fire generated by Sunset's magic and the power from Galactica Spark. Helreginn, Jotnar in charge of Nifhel, in a bid to prevent his own death, was trying to kill my friends and take me alive.

And I was flying towards his Frost Giant.. at over 100 miles an hour.

What I failed to realize, was, Sunset was NEXT TO ME.

Sunset: "LIGHT HIS ASS UP, KAY!" She screamed.

I just.. went with it, and started flicking fireballs from the tip of the sword.

They hit the Frost Giant and started causing wounds. Big ones. The Frost Giant tried to lash out at me with its forehooves, but I felt myself move away from it.

I was fighting without knowing how.

Problem is, while I was dealing damage, Helreginn was healing his Frost Giant almost as fast as I was hurting it. This couldn't go on much longer, I was already getting weak, an-

???: "EEF DE HUMAN DEFIES DE GODS, SO SHALL I!" I heard another voice behind me. "GO, GUNGNIR! STRIKE HIM DOWN!"

I gigantic spear larger than a telephone pole whizzed past my head by inches, hit the Frost Giant, and sent it into the mountain about a mile from the fortress, impaling it, and killing it. The Frost Giant exploded in ice and snow.

Helreginn: "YOU STUPID VALKYRIE! YOU HAVE DOOMED US ALL!" He lashed out, sending a wave of energy at us.

Instantly, we could see only light. Everything vanished before us.

Part 2: Valkyr Alicorn

LOCATION: UNKNOWN


I rolled over as I woke up.. in a void.

K: "Galactica?" I just asked, as I stood.

She was before me as shimmering energy, again.

K: "..look, uh.. thanks for the save. I'm sorry about the Tiamat thing, but.. I couldn't let Twilight die." I lowered my head.

Galactica: "Without realizing it, you have restored a fate that was thought lost."

K: "Oh?" I looked up at her.

Galactica: "Don't listen to any of the other Gods. They care not for the lives of Ponies. I do. Even if I must accept the deaths of many, to save all the rest. Go forward, and know, you are in the right."

----------------------------------------

I sat up, hearing sea shores. Waves crashing on sand.

In my hand was the Sword of Rainbow's Light. It was changed, now, the hilt looked like a pair of wings, but formed an even more effective crossguard.

I looked over, seeing Sunset, still in her arctic gear, laying on her side, breathing, but out cold.

I looked over the other way, and saw a tan mare.. a HUGE tan mare.. with battle scars.. nude.

That must've been the Valkyrie.

K: "SUNSET!" I called to her.

Sunset groaned and rolled over.. then looked at me with fear in her eyes.

Sunset: "Kay?! He-HELP ME GET THIS OFF!" She said, panicked.

I slid over to her, and helped her get her coat and top off.

WINGS.

Sunset: "...KKAYYYYY!?" She freaked, letting them flex out. "KAY?! WHAT HAPPENED TO ME!?"

K: "Relax, relax.." I held her in a hug. "..you.. I, uh... I think Galactica just made you an Alicorn." I blinked.

Restored fate?

Sunset: "I'M AN ALICORN!?" Her eyes bugged out of her head, almost. "Ohhh.. Sweet Celestia." She moaned sadly, and rested her head on my shoulder. "At least, wherever we are, I got you, Kay.. I'm.. I'm not alone."

Sunset.. and Twilight.. both Alicorns, but different. Sisters, now. Not before, but now they are..

Sunset pulled away, and flexed her wings again.

Sunset: "Jesus Christ, this war." And sighed.

K: "I thought you weren't Christian?" I smirked at her.

Sunset: "I stayed there long enough, Kay, to get plenty of the lingo." She frowned, and pulled back, starting to sort out her gear, as I did likewise.

K: "Got my rifle and ammo.. food.. water.. just.." I stood up, and looked towards the horizon.

We were somewhere warm.

Sunset: "Gee, Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas any more." She smirked. "Feels like the Tropics."

K: "He banished me, instead of killing me or imprisoning me." I shrugged.. and looked at our companion, who I went over to, and put my hand on.. I did feel some ebbing energy, there. "She's alive. Hey.." I shook her. "Wake up."

Valkyrie: "Uhnnn.." She rolled up to her haunches like a well oiled machine. "..oohh.. feels like I het far, far too much Ale last night." She put her hoof to her head, then looked at us. "De hyoomin." And smiled. "Odin vas so mad." She shook her head.

K: "You stole Gungnir and used it on a Frost Giant, defying the Gods themselves on behalf of mortals. That's.. kinda your job?" I shrugged.

Valkyrie: "Jae.." She smirked and tilted her head. "..maybe I just vanted in 'dis var?" She nodded to Sunset. "I see you, too, did not get away vithout de punishments."

Sunset: "Ah.. yeah.." She shrugged, and shrugged her wings at the same time. "Got a name?"

Steela: "Steela Oresdottir." She nodded. "Captain of the Fort of the Desert of Frost."

K: "Interesting title." I pursed my lips in thought. "That the Fortress of Harmony, or a different place?"

Steela: "Ohh.. far deefrent." She nodded. "Is close to vhere you fought Tirek." She smirked. "I been vatching you, Human." And cocked a brow.. sharply.

Sunset moved in front of me, and casually spread her wings.

Sunset: "Take it easy, sister. I don't care if you're built like a brick shithouse, Kay is off limits to newcomers." She snorted a tiny bit.

Steela: "Ohhh.." She gave a coy look. "..a shame, I could bear him foals sure to conquer nations." She leaned in a bit.

K: "You're a fangirl." I pointed at her.

Steela: "Mmmm.. as I vas a Valkyrie, I vas attracted to varriors.. you proved yourself to be a varrior, despite everyone's gamble that you vould fail. I have followed you from de beginning, vatching, vaiting, maybe you come to Valhalla, I think? I vould have revarded you.. handsomely." But, she sighed. "No, I understand. You are ved to another." She wagged her hoof back and forth. "But, I made a blood oath vhen I vas still a Valkyrie. Eef I get to be vith you, zat I vould be your loyal friend, bound to fight by your side." She gestured. "It seems I must earn my place back."

K: "Works for me." I shrugged. "Now. Where the HELL are we?" I said, giving the sun a glance... it looked to be.. morning?

LOCATION: UNKNOWN

Sunset: "Now what? We could be on a deserted island, or something!" She hissed.

K: "I don't think so." I pointed at the water. "Look there. I see part of a damaged boat sticking out of the water. That over there is a mangrove swamp. The wood is very dense and good for a lot of things. I can see at least a couple stumps clearly cut down by pony habitation." I shrugged. "Or, some other sentient species."

Sunset: "Plan?" She gestured.

K: "Break down our gear and get walking. Find signs of habitation and follow them. Someone must live around here - and, with luck, we can find a way back home." I shrugged. "Next time I go to sleep, I can try contacting Luna and giving her a report. For the MOMENT, I can at least assure her I'm alive." I said, grasping the sword. "Luna. Give me strength." I said, quietly, asking for only a tiny amount.. and the sword glowed as I did.

I tried to think about an image of where we were at, that perhaps she could get the message that I was alive and well. And, perhaps, send someone to find us, if she could get a fix on us.

Steela: "Aes expected." She shrugged, with a smile. "You know vhat to do."

K: "Yep. Now, let's get going - I know quite a few tropical fruits that are safe and good eating, plus, we have our guns, we can hunt, if we need to." I shrugged.

Now.. I just had to wait.. and help myself out of this situation, until our friends could find us.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Spicy Islands!

TIME: 00:03 GKT/~12:03 Local
DATE: War Day 901/26 Noneous, 1004 C.S. (Local)
LOCATION: Unknown island in the Tropics

I calculated a 12 hour time difference, more or less, from where we'd been in the Griffon Kingdom. That literally meant we'd been sent half way across the known world, and close to the Barrier, in fact. I wasn't exactly sure where.

We'd been walking casually - no sense getting exhausted - and taking in the sights. None of us had ever been to this part of the world before. However, I'd watched enough Discovery Channel and History Channel (before it became The Pawn Stars Channel level drek) to know what trees and bushes I was looking for.

What had once been our Parkas, were now temporarily bound together holding fruits of various kinds. There was a large Mango tree, and I showed how to get the outer part off, to get to the good bits inside. Mangosteens, too. I'd never had one, and found them delicious. We even found a huge Jackfruit tree.

Sunset: "Well, we're sure not going to starve!" She giggled.

Steela: "I have neever had such t'ings before, K." She smiled, munching part of a Mangosteen.

K: "Good gosh, I'm so full." I patted my belly. "The jungle abounds, if you know what to look for." I shrugged.

Sunset: "That's for sure." She nodded. "Just in case we need it - water?"

K: "Best to boil any we find, just in case. Tropical parasites and bacteria also abound - to which our bodies would have no natural defense." I shrugged. "In a severe emergency, find a large sea turtle and carve it open - they have water bladders full of fresh water. It'll taste strange, but if you're about to die from dehydration, that's a viable survival tactic. The Dutch did that a lot, if I recall." I gestured.

Sunset: "Mmm. And I expect sea turtle tastes okay?" She shrugged.

K: "I'd rather try Water Buffalo or something." I nodded. "They'll likely have wild chickens in these parts, too. That's fine eating." I nodded a bit. "Especially be on the lookout for black chickens - everything about them is black, even the meat." I looked at Steela. "Let me guess - meat-heavy diet?"

Steela: "Is a gut guess, jae." She smiled a bit. "I want one ov d'ose Water Buffalos, too.." She wiggled a brow. "I betcha I can eat a whole half'a one."

K: "I bet you could." I grinned. "So, Sunset.. how's it feel?"

Sunset: "I'm.. starting to get used to it. Kay.. does this mean.. I might become like Celestia and Luna?" She looked at me, concerned.

K: "Maybe. I mean, you and Twilight.. your names are for preceeding times of day. She WAS your replacement. Celestia hinted that she's wanted Ponies to take over Pony affairs so she and Luna could step back. I was starting to form a Parliamentary Government with Twilight as Prime Minister.. perhaps now, Celestia and Luna can step back sooner, and you can take the role. I mean, after this war, nopony alive could doubt your courage or commitment to the Kingdom." I gestured.

Sunset: "..me, a Princess." She smiled a bit. "I want to do so much, now, to help everyone."

K: "Maybe you'll get that chance." I nodded.

About thirty minutes later, with us still kinda hugging the shore, I could hear..

K: "..gunfire!? Those sound like Shermans!" I said, getting the food pack and cargo off.

Sunset: "Oh, fuck! Seriously!?" She shed her gear as well. "Listen, Steela, I know you haven't been in a scrap in a few centuries, so let us handle this!"

K: "Be careful." Was all I said. "Remember, you're not a Valkyrie any longer."

Steela: "Beh!" She snorted, and grabbed a hunk of wood off the ground, a rock, and jammed it into the end, quickly wrapping it with a canvas strap. "A Viking and her Hammer are not soon parted!"

Sunset: "Ooo.. I like her, ovaries on the outside for sure." She smiled.

K: "Alright, advance LOW and CAREFUL - whoever's shooting, might shoot us by mistake if we don't." I explained to Steela.

We moved quickly, and came over a sand dune, to see some kind of Motor Launch, with four clearly dead ponies in front of it, wearing what looked like some kind of Naval Infantry combat uniform. A fourth, in a sailor suit, was slumped over the side of the launch. Five extremely large Raptorian-shaped creatures - almost as big as Porcine - were advancing on one last Pony, who was clearly wounded, and scooting back on their haunches, holding a handgun out in front of them.

K: "Sunset, take them down. Get the left side." I knelt and got my Grant up. "COVERING FIRE!!"

I fired ten shots into the first Raptorian on the right.

HE ATE THEM.

Not for long, as he soon fell to the ground, but he soaked ten rounds of 7mm NEIGHTO without dropping. Sunset, having a scoped Kreuger, got the first on the left with a head shot.. and he tanked THAT, too, for a moment!

The other three turned on us, and INSTANTLY took to the air, with one flap of their wings.

K: "Shit-shit-shit-shit-shit!" I switched to full auto, picked one, and HOSED IT.

Sunset: "AH, FUCK!" She did the same.

Steela: "LAST IS MINE! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!" She jumped into the air with her makeshift hammer, and slammed it down on its head just as it got close.

She then rode the sucker into the ground, and once it was down, she beat the living hell out of it until her hammer broke. Then, pummeled it with her hoof until she was CERTAIN it was dead.

K: "Holy shit!" I chuckled.

Sunset: "Hmm.. that feel when no Norse Berzerker Gee-Eff?" She ribbed me.

K: "I got a country-fried sex freak, I'm good. Actually, I'd like to see those two wrestle." I shrugged.

Sunset cocked a brow and whispered something about wanting to see the same thing, and how I'd be very happy having her in my lap in the meantime.

K: "Flirt." I smirked.

Sunset: "You know it." She nodded. "GOOD JOB, STEELA!"

We advanced down the beach towards the wounded pony.

Pony Officer: "Wie ben jij!? Wat doe je hier?!" He asked as we approached, holding his handgun in front of him.

K: "Easy, easy, dude." I slung my rifle behind me. "I think.. he's speaking.. Dutch!" I blinked.. and looked up at the Launch, which had the ol' Colgate Toothpaste flag on it. "Uhh.. Nederlands?" I pointed at him.

Sunset: "You speak Dutch?" She cocked a brow.

K: "Not very well! It's like a German and an Englishman got drunk and tried to talk at the same time." I shrugged.

Pony Officer: "Ja! Neigtherlands!" He adjusted the pronounciation. "Luitenant Piet van Brakel, Koninklijk Korps Mariniers! Wie ben je? Stel jezelf voor!"

K: "Ahhhh.. I think he just gave me his name and rank." I tapped my chest..

..mind you, Steela is behind us, smirking like she knows a good joke..

K: "General-Field Marshal K of Equestria." I paused. "Ahh.. Generaal K." I tried to lilt it correctly.

Steela: "AHAHHA! Your Dutch is so funny!" She slapped my arm and stepped forwards. "Ik ben Steela. Steela Oresdottir. Dit is Generaal K van Equestria, en Sunset Shimmer."

Piet: "Ahhh." He nodded.. then looked a bit confused. "Waarom ben je hier?"

K: "Tell him I have no idea, but we defied Helreginn, and we got sent here.. and make sure you explain how?" I ribbed her back.

Steela: "Oh, sure." She shrugged, and nodded to Piet. "De Generaal en Sunset trotseerden Helreginn. Ik doodde zijn vorstreus met Gungnir. Odin verbande mij uit Walhalla omdat ik zijn speer had gestolen, en ik ben er vrij zeker van dat Helreginn ons hierheen verbande." She giggled.

Piet: "HAHA!" He re-holstered his pistol, seeing he was among friends. "Heel dapper!"

K: "Let me see what I can do for him. Sunset, Steela, go get our packs?" I pointed to his injury, and made a motion of a plus sign on my arm.

Sunset: "Gotcha, K. Come on, girl." She nodded and off they went.

Piet: "De Eerste Hulp Bij Ongevallen doos bevindt zich in de sloep." He pointed.

K: "Erste Hulp.. first help.. first aid." I nodded that I understood. "I bet you're getting about every fifth word, too. Deutsch sprechen? Vous parlez Prançais?"

Piet: "PRANCAIS!" He nodded. "Une petite quantité!" He said in a thick Dutch accent. "Deutsch? Nicht gut."

K: "Well, that's something." I nodded, finding the kit underneath the body of another sailor. "Je vais soigner ton saignement." Hey, Sacquet has been teaching me, alright? I told him I'd fix the bleeding.

Getting out, I got over to him, and got in a squat, pulling and gently ripping his uniform to inspect the wounds. None were all that serious, but he was bleeding good.

K: "What... Stad.. are you from?" I thought along the lines of 'What would a Drunk German say?' to translate City, or at least match the sound.

Piet: "Stad? Ahhh! Reithoven! Jij?" He got that I was making small talk.

I used some antiseptic soaked sterile cloth to make sure the wounds were gently cleaned, and wrapped them firmly, with antiseptic-dosed gauze.

K: "Ponyville." I nodded. "Sweet Apple Acres." I blinked. "Sucre Appel-Acre." I said in mixed German and Prench.

Piet: "Ahhhh!" He nodded firmly.

Despite us speaking literally FOUR languages at once, we all got the idea of what we were saying.

We were making friends, despite our differences.

And as I always say, Friendship is Magic.

[End of Part 3]

Part 4: Java

TIME: 11:47 Neigtherlands Colony Time
DATE: War Day 901/26 Noneus, 1004 C.S. (local)
LOCATION: Motor Sloop #2 of Hr.Ms. Java, off the coast of Sumatra


I was off - the time difference was ten hours. We took some time to secure the bodies of those killed on the shore, and brought aboard both our gathered supplies, and a quick run to the jungle's edge for more fruit.

That's why Piet and his troops had gone out. To get fruit. The ship had been out for over a week, and they had just now gotten close to shore.

Through talking in all our different languages, I got most of the story. Apparently, the Hr.Ms. Java was a coastal defense vessel of some kind, and had been assigned to the island of Java, but an invasion by Tirek's forces had forced it to flee, after taking some battle damage. While trying to find the main body of the fleet, they'd gotten lost, as their compass had been damaged and had led them off course.

Over that time, they'd run out of almost everything. Except coffee. They'd just taken on an extra load of the stuff from Tegal, bound for Jakarta, when Tirek attacked. The ship itself could purify sea water into potable water. They had weapons and ammo. They, however, were short on all kinds of food stuffs.

Hence, the expedition to gather whatever they could from the Jungle. Piet had spend 12 of his 24 years in the Colonies, and while he'd attended the Naval Academy back home, this was his first taste of any action at all.

Sunset: "Soo.. what'd all he say about the Dutch? They going to help us?" She asked, as she steered the boat.

K: "Apparently, Princess Wilhelmina was convinced by a recently-outed fifth columnist that Prance and Germaneigh wanted to use NEIGHTO as an excuse to invade and take over parts or all of the Neigtherlands. They've been fighting their own sort of conflict with Tirek since the start of the war." I shrugged. "Now, he's not sure what. They're taking steps recently to align with NEIGHTO policy, but, he's not sure if they're going to do anything diplomatically. That's above his pay grade."

Steela: "So.. vhat vill ve do?" She asked.

K: "Simple. Get back to the Java, hope we can find the Dutch fleet, and see if we can get a radio signal to a NEIGHTO ally." I gestured. "According to him, the time to travel back to Europe on a sea vessel is about thirty days. If my math is right, we're literally ten thousand miles from home - we went the furthest we could. And, again according to Piet, we're probably five or so hundred miles from part of the barrier. He's not completely sure, since sailing too far west of the Sumatra opposite shore is strictly forbidden for that reason."

Steela: "Unt how far is the Java from us?" She shrugged.

K: "Couple hours. They're at anchor in a small atoll with high trees, hiding from the enemy. It seems we stumbled upon Tirek's next offensive." I gestured to Sunset. "You better be on your 'A' Game - you're all I have."

Sunset: "Well..!" She chuckled. "I hope I am, too! Military shit is all new to me." She blinked. "I'll have to start thinking of all that strategy stuff Twilight shoved down my throat."

Steela: "I help as well!" She nodded firmly.

K: "Good. Come here, I need to teach you to use guns." I nodded.

Steela: "Yesss.. guns." She nodded a bit.

K: "Let's see here." I picked up one of the Dutch rifles.. and examined it closely.

The Madsen-Rassusen 9x35mm self loading rifle was a bit long by Pony standards, and a bit unusual, in that the receiver had a swing-out door that contained a fixed stripper clip guide, so the magazine in the gun could be reloaded.

Barrel length was 470mm, or 18.5 inches. It used Sherman magazines that, by my guess, were copies-of-copies. They felt right, like, they didn't feel as though they were out-of-spec. If I was to guess, I wagered that the Dutch somehow obtained Tirek copied Shermans and Zhukovs, then made their own higher quality versions of them, using the same magazines.

And, as I'd established ages ago, Tirek copies were down-to-the-micro-millimeter accurate duplicates, but devoid of markings.

The safety lever also, of all things, had a magazine cut-off setting. Press the safety in, and push forwards, and the magazine was partly ejected, but still held in place. Completely un-needed on the Sherman, but I examined the pouches carried by the Dutch Marines and found they were issued only two spare 10-round mags and a single 30-round mag, and had expense pouches of loose ammunition. Each pouch held 30 loose rounds, and they had four.

Okay, now it made sense. They must have some kind of problem getting enough magazines made, or something. So, the individual soldier should be able to single-load rounds in calmer shooting situations, or be able to expend full magazines, then rapidly reload them. Not having to make stripper clips? Handy idea.

Everything on this rifle made sense, from the perspective of a nation that was making do with what it had on hand. They needed us.

I showed her the basics, and thankfully, the rifle wasn't too different from a Sherman in how it handled. I had her snipe at fish that were near the surface, and I scooped them up in a net once she got them.

Steela: "Mm.. de veppon of the varrior changes, his discipline does not." She nodded, hefting it.

K: "Looks like they use a tube-and-socket bayonet." I pulled one out, and slipped it over the end. "Now, you have a spear." I nodded.

TIME: 13:55 NCT
LOCATION: Pabelok Atoll

We found the Java easily, and I could see what Piet meant by battle damage. The ship was armed with 3 dual 5-inch gun turrets, some 25mm quad mounts, and a single 40mm dual gun in the rear.

Of that, one of the 25mm mounts was clearly damaged by an explosion, the forwardmost 5-inch gun turret had a deep gouge in it where a Tirek shell deflected, and there was what looked like shrapnel and fire damage across her upper superstructure.

Of course, there was.. SOME concern that their Motor Sloop was being piloted by foreigners.

K: "General-Field Marshal K---- K---, Supreme Allied Commander of NEIGHTO, and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Equestria, Knight of the Crystal Realm, and party, requesting permission to come aboard, Captain." I saluted him crisply.

KLTTZ Cornelis Hustaert: "Kapitein-luitenant ter zee Cornelis Hustaert, Commanding, Her Majesty's Java." He saluted back. "Permission granted. I see you have my Marine Officer."

K: "Piet was wounded, the only survivor of an attack by Raptorians, while gathering supplies." I shrugged. "I've provided what aide I can, but if you have a Doctor aboard, he could use one."

We stepped up on to the deck, and I offered my hand, which Kapitein Hustaert accepted, and we shook hand-in-hoof. Steela and Sunset helped the sailors get Piet aboard as we did.

KLTTZ Cornelis Hustaert: "Weull, General.." He shrugged. "Yew saved my Marine Commander. I suppose I should welcome you aboardt."

K: "Thank you, Captain." I bowed to him, helping Sunset off the Sloop.

Cornelis: "I be fair, Gen'ral.." He gestured to me. "..I never before t'day have done violence to anoder creature."

K: "That's pretty common on this world." I shook my head. "Don't blame yourself."

Cornelis: "Still, my cousin, de Vice-Admiraal Deurpaard, I think he vould liek your help." He looked at a shell hole in the side of the superstructure that still had blood on it. "Celestia knows, I could."

K: "I won't take command of the ship if that's what you're asking - these are your ponies." I gave the surrender hands.

Cornelis: "Is fine. Jest.. advice. What do I do? Has been a week, so far." He looked at his boat.

K: "Give me a complete run down on our operational status." I nodded.

Cornelis: "Engines sustained soem damage, speed is 25 knots. We need to take de engine apart and find where the trouble is, but we have no spare parts, nor oil or grees to fix it back up again. One 25 milimeter gun is damage, probably can't be fixed, as again, we haven't spare parts for it. Most badly, the radio set is damaged." He shook his head. "While we can receive and listen to radio traffic, ve cannot send. We need supplies to fix de ship, or ve need to find de fleet."

K: "Where were you supposed to rendesvous?" I asked.

Cornelis: "Teluk Lampung. A harbor. But, we been there, and Tirek's fleet was there already. So, now, I not know where to go." He shrugged.

K: "Okay.. is there a naval depot around? Some place we can get parts and supplies?" I shrugged, as we walked into the superstructure, and towards the bridge.

Cornelis: "Ja. There is one, but.." He shrugged. "..if it is held by Tirek's troops?"

K: "Do you have any more Marines aboard?" I asked.

Cornelis: "Five more. Luitenant van Brakel took half and went for food." He shrugged.

K: "Fuel remaining?" I inquired next.

Cornelis: "Enough to travel perhaps 600 nautical mile." He nodded firmly. "After dat, we row." And smirked.

Steela: "ROW!" She snorted. "Lash me to the bow, Captain, I swim us home!" She stood proud.

K: "She was a valkyrie until yesterday. I wouldn't doubt her!" I smiled.

Cornelis: "A-HA-HA!" He beamed a grin. "Indeed, I would not, either!"

K: "Show me on the map table, here, where the most likely places the fleet would try to rendesvous at?" I tapped it.

Cornelis: "Hmm.. Jakarta has fallen.. I know they get as far as Tegal." He tapped the map with his hoof. "There is a major base at Surabaya, but.." He shrugged. "..if the fleet is not there, we haven't the fuel to look elsewhere."

K: "What about on this side of Java? On Sumatra?" I tapped the map.

Cornelis: "Tanjungpinang." He nodded. "That is our largest base in that region." And shrugged. "Again, one shot is all we have."

K: "Alright. And the naval supply depot?" I slid my finger across the map as a petty officer brought us coffee.

Cornelis: "Pangkalpinang." He nodded back.

K: "Okay, then. I suggest we head for it. When we get there, I'll go ashore with the remaining Marines.. I'll need someone else that speaks Equestrian, though." I shrugged.

Cornelis: "Ahhh.. only myself and my first officer speak it well." He shook his head. "I will go." And nodded.

Sunset: "Very brave of you, Captain." She smiled a bit.

Cornelis: "If de Gen'raal is willing to share the risk of the Marines, so should I." He nodded firmly.

K: "It's decided, then." I made a firm nod, and stood straight. "We'll take the chance."

Cornelis: "Indeed. If Tirek's forces are there already, they may be spread thin enough for us to carry away many things on our backs." He smirked.

K: "If not, we lay anchor and strip the place bare of everything we can get." I shrugged. "We'll have to counter Tirek's forces quickly - if we wait too long, his troops will run out of their preferred rations and start eating the locals."

Cornelis: "Oh, By Celestia!" He profaned. "I would wish you joke, but I don't think you would!" And scowled. "How long have we?"

K: "The sooner the better - but I'd like to see if we have enough time to perhaps get another NEIGHTO nation over here to help support us, if we can. Is Neighpon closer than Europe?" I cocked a brow.

Cornelis: "Ja.. they are." He shrugged. "Would they be able to?"

K: "The Emperor is my personal friend. If I can get a message to him, he'll send everything he's got just for the off chance of spilling even a drop of Tirek's blood." I grinned. "Daishiro is very adamant about avenging his nation."

Cornelis: "Aha! Then, how can we lose?" He raised his coffee cup. "To new friends!"

K: "New friends." I tapped rims, and drank.

We had a plan... but did we have the forces needed to execute it? I'd find out eventually. Little did I realize, but I'd been Isekai'd into a major situation..

Part 5: Lull

DATE: War Day 901/26 Noneus, 1004 C.S. (local)
LOCATION: Hr.Ms. Java, en route to Bangka Island


We were exhausted. Finally, we had a chance to rest. Somewhat grimly, we were given the quarters of the five killed Marines to ourselves, with the captain apologizing for not having proper VIP quarters. Sunset and Steela got the place spruced up while I set about getting our gear organized better.

The Dutch were using an 'enhanced' 9x35mm round that bore striking resemblence to the 9x35mm rounds used in the Nasser rifle. In fact, to me, it seemed like the Orghuz 9x35mm round was the next evolutionary step above this round. Either way, it hit hard, and it had a flatter trajectory than original Equestrian 9x35mm Mark I rounds.

Between me and Sunset, we had 15 7mm NEIGHTO magazines for our rifles. She was, admittedly, a better shot than me, so I prioritized her on ammo. Once we went ashore, I'd use a Dutch rifle. As for handguns, they had something that vaguely resembled an FN 1910, chambered in 9x18mm Equestrian and using Lee magazines. It was much better put together than a Lee, and seemed more reliable.

I familiarized myself with them as best I could. While I'd be keeping my Dager pistol as long as possible, I didn't want to be unfamiliar with their handgun, should I need to use it.

Susnet: "So, Tiger.." She slid up to me, having finished making the bed. "..we, ah, going to have a little fun, or what?"

K: "While I'm very glad that you still find our fun entertaining, given your.. now four legged form.." I turned to her and gave her a peck on the horn. "..I don't want Steela over there getting jealous."

Steela: "Mm. He is right. I do not want to just watch." She flicked her tail at me. "I would be begging him to give me foals."

K: "I'm married. Sunset is.. she has a special status." I shrugged.

Steela: "Ahh.. a Stallion with several mares in his paddock. As I have seen. It is a shame I cannot join them." She smirked. "A True Alpha is rare, these days." And shrugged.

K: "I.. take that as a compliment, but without Applejack here to give the approval - no." I shrugged.

Sunset: "Mmm. Eh. It is what it is." She shrugged. "I do hope to get some time alone, you know." She.. ALSO flicked her tail at me. "I'm getting used to being on four legs.. and.." She wiggled her brow. "..you know."

K: "I get it, I get it." I shrugged, and got in one of the bunks. "Let's just get some sleep, hmm?"

And once I was asleep...

.........

..

Luna: "Mmmmmmmm.." She was running her hands (human form!) all over my body.

K: "There's my Princess." I kissed her. Passionately.

Luna: "Everyone is okay.. you know, they - at first - concluded that God decided to send you home?" She started.. sloppily making out with me.

K: "He might've had the power.." I found my words strangled in my throat by her very, very eager tongue. "..ah, fuck it. Come 'ere, you!"

Noooo.. you get no details. Sorry, horndogs. Let's just say, we went a few rounds, and we both rather enjoyed ourselves. It'd been some time since I'd had the chance to really, fully enjoy Luna's company, and I did very much love her, too.

LOCATION: Approaching Bangka Island


I was up on the bridge. Since I'd packed only fall/winter uniform shirts and pants, my sleeves were rolled all the way up.

K: "I can already see some smoke, Captain." I shrugged.

Cornelis: "Indeed!" He frowned. "Seems we are late."

K: "I have a feeling Tirek is going to over-extend himself again. He doesn't think I'm here with my usual crew. And you told me, yesterday, you'd been fighting a low level conflict for the last two years and change." I gestured. "We deprived him of Neighpon last year. He's had time to rebuild his forces, if he regenerates them like we think he does." I pointed to the island. "He needs territory. Slave labor. Forward bases. Resources."

Cornelis: "So, he hits us. He thinks us barely a match for him." He nodded.

K: "Yep, since you don't have the magic of friendship. Yet." I smirked. "But, you have me and all my experience."

Cornelis: "Which we will need." He nodded firmly. "What have you thought of, for a plan?"

K: "We haven't been challenged by any small vessels, yet. I'd like to wait until dusk. Then, go in as night approaches, and steal whatever we can. We'll take every boat available - you, me, Sunset, Steela, and your remaining Marines will be in the lead vessel, and every other boat empty except its pilot. We secure the Naval Depot as best we can, grab everything we can lay our hands on, and get out before we end up in a fight we can't handle. We'll bring Java in close, too, so we have a short trip, and we can use the gunnery director to scan the shoreline. In an emergency, we can use the ship's guns to give us cover." I said, leaning over the map table, and having a mango.

Really, besides fruit and oats, the ship had very little else in its holds. Food was going to be vitally important.

Cornelis: "The plan sounds good." He nodded a bit.

K: "Alright, explain it to the Marines. You'll have to translate for me, but I'm not really going to be giving any complex orders. Go here, grab that, shoot them, don't shoot them." I gestured.

Cornelis: "Mmm. I will go right away." He departed from the Bridge, leaving me with his first officer, Lieutenant 1st Class Nicholaas Roell.

Roell: "I admit I am nervous." He shrugged. "Remember, we were attacked violently, and simply returned fire. We may have been in this low level conflict for some years, but our crew has very little experience."

K: "Yeah, when the Java was damaged when you were approaching Jakarta." I nodded. "Inexperience is a hard wall to climb, some ponies won't make it, but we have to do what we can."

Roell: "I feel we can do this." He smiled a bit.

K: "Together, we can do anything - as I've learned around here, Friendship is Magic. And having friends means you can overcome any adversity, with their help." I clapped a hand on Roell's shoulder.

Roell: "Then, we cannot fail." He grinned broadly.

Now, we just needed to raid the supply depot.. make off with the stuff we needed, and hopefully find the Dutch fleet. Then, we'd take the fight to Tirek.
