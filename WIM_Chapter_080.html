Part 1: Iberian Lock-Step

LOCATION: Don Francesco's Estate, Girul, Navarre

K: "How is Tirek involved?" I got right to the point.

Starlight: "Moreover.. if we help you drive him from your lands.. would that mean we can guarantee your support in NEIGHGTO?" She tag-teamed with me.

Duke Condor: "To the second question.. that will depend on how much of a nation, a people, I have remaining when the war ends.. and whether I become King." He gestured with a hoof. "Certainly, if everything goes well, I will be grateful, and offer whatever assistance I can." He then looked to me. "As to the first? Well.."

Duchess Condor: "Well." She came in with three maids, with hand carts, all with food on them. "That can wait for after you eat! Talk war on an empty stomach, again, mi amore, you get heartburn." She coo'd to him and gave him a small nuzzle.

K: "Yes, Ma'am." I nodded deeply to her.

Applejack: "Yeah, I could sure use a spot'a breakfast.." She blinked, as a vertiable feast was laid out before us.

Firecracker: "I see what you mean.." She leaned in to Gorcat. "..things do get strange around here."

Starlight: "I'm just happy we're friendly, here.." She saw all the food, and smiled broadly. "This looks amazing!"

I dug right in - it was a bit more than I expected. Cafe con Leche, a Bocadillos with cheese, Pan Con Tomate, Churros, and a Spanish potato omelette. I remembered that Spanish breakfasts were usually light, so, it was interesting to see three 'main courses' set on one plate. I surmised she guessed (correctly) that we hadn't had dinner the previous night.

Everyone ate with minimal conversation. I noted Gorcat was teaching Firecracker the ropes - he'd been with us for a long time, he knew how we operated. Dusty seemed very at-ease with these foods, and I guessed she'd had some before. Starlight and Rarity both ate dantily, though Rarity with more natural class, and Starlight more like someone that learned it later.

Applejack: "Ah'm sorry fer bein' so sore at'cha, hun.." She finally admitted, thumping her head into my right side. "..jes' - I was afraid you'd.. you know."

I leaned in and kissed her nose.

K: "It's okay, honey. I understood you were mad because you thought I'd put myself into too much danger, again. And, I'm the most likely one they'd've executed for.. say.. espionage or something." I shrugged, and kept eating. "This is fantasic, Duchess. I've never had all of these items together before."

Duchess Condor: "Ah! Then I shall have to see about treating you to more of our cuisine. It is.. such important part of who we are." She smiled.

Duke Condor: "I had once heard ponies prefer tea in the mornings.." He trailed off, seeing me drain the coffee cup quickly.

K: "I'm no pony, Your Highness." I said, addressing him more as 'king apparent' than as the Duke. "Humans drink coffee and tea both - I prefer coffee, but I do drink tea when it's available. We're omnivores, so, we literally eat anything that doesn't eat us first." I gave him a smile - no sense telling him I had goat once, and LOVED it.

Applejack: "An' I'll drink a cup'a whatever's available in the mornin' - sometimes, it's coffe, sometimes, tea." She smiled a bit.

Duke Condor: "Ah!" He smiled. "Would you care for more coffee them, Mariscal?"

K: "Please. Cafe solo." I didn't even need to hold up my cup - a maid came over with a decanter and poured it for me. "I recognize the Navarran preference for sweet in the morning, but I don't want to have too much sugar." I nodded slightly. "Not that it wasn't fantastic."

Duke Condor: "Ahaha! A gracious guest!" He bowed slightly to me. "I see you are a person I can respect."

Duchess Condor: "Si. He even speaks Navarese." She nodded to me.

Duke Condor: "Well, now that we have had our breakfast.." He said, as the maids removed empty plates - everyone had cleaned theirs. "We talk business." He nodded to me.

K: "Indeed." I nodded to my team. "Everyone here is an advisor on my General Staff, with each their own talents and inputs. Starlight, as an Ambassador, is an expert in negotiation." I said, validating their presence.

Duke Condor: "Even your wife?" He nodded to Applejack.

K: "Land Warfare Advsior, Logistics Advisor.." I nodded.

Duke Condor: "Aha!" He beamed a grin. "Is good to have such talented officers, good freinds, Amigos." He raised his coffee cup to each of them. "Now. Tirek." He lowered his head. "When this conflict started almost two years ago, we did not know exactly.. how.. certain things, certain events.. had come to pass." He looked up at me. "I have a confession I must make, Senor. Our government purchased information from a spy three years ago, about you and your designs for.. what you call fire arms." He enunicated that as two seperate words. "You may not understand this, but Ibexeria has had its own issues with Ponykind.. when we attempted to colonize the area known as Mulexico, we brought the Mules there our langauge and culture.. then, they reject our rule and throw us out - we know that Equestria assisted with this."

K: "I can't say anything about that - I've only been here for four years, sir. I don't know all of Equestria's history." I shrugged.

Duke Condor: "Is in the past, si?" He shook his head, and continued. "Our paranoia that Ponykind might seek our conquest or destruction has led us to make careful watch of Equestria, through middle men - professional lookers, si? Spies." He shrugged a tad. "When we find out about YOU? Ho-ho-ho.. there was some certain reservation! The old legend, you see? That a human would come, and help Tirek conquer the world, or destroy him. So, we watch, we watch to see if you are with Tirek or not. You make weapons.. we become a bit afraid. Our best engineers, chemists, and toymakers come together to take your design ideas, and make our own. So, if you are hostile, we have means to resist."

K: "Perfectly understandable, Duke Condor." I nodded to him. "If you're making an apology, there's no need - I would have done exactly the same in your position."

Duke Condor: "Ah!" He chuckled again. "See? A good guest!" He leaned forward and patted me on the shoulder. "You are a soldier, Mariscal - I thought you might understand." He grinned widely at me. "So. We start to have our own fire arms.. then, we have a political crisis. Certain elements in our government that have sympathy for the Herdiet Union? They win some seats in Cortes Generales. Enough to call for a referendum on the future of the Navarese Throne - they call for the King to be removed. They are voted down. The next thing we know, Colectivista Red Guard are raiding our capital.. many members of the Chamber of Deputies in Iruna.. they were arrested. Some members of the Senatos.. escaped." He shook his head. "Those arrested were executed. They also tried to assassinate King Alfonso the 8th, but instead killed his son, Crown Prince Alfonso Castile." He shrugged, heavy-hearted. "I am his father's brother.. was." He lowered his head. "My brother's marriage was supposed to unite the Castillan and Navarese cultures together at last. My nephew.. he was a Ibexian of the People, everyone loved him.."

K: "Interesting. In my world, your culture and Kingdom were conquered by the Castile and Aragonese.. oh.. about five hundred years before the last day I was on my Earth. I see, here, Navarese became the dominant culture." I nodded to him.

Duke Condor: "Not without great struggles. We, being Ibex, were very isolated for a long while. We raised up several major cultures - Asturias, Castile, Aragonese, and Navarese. Over time, and with trade, relations, marriages, and some war.. the Navarese and Aragonese became one, and the Asturians and Castile become the other. Once the crowns were reduced to two, then.. then the problems began. Conflict, hard feelings.. about a thousand years ago, the King of Castile and the King of Navarre met for a duel. Being evenly matched, it was no sure thing, but they threw aside the potential for bloodshed, neither wanting harm and strife to come to their nations' peoples. The King of Navarre narrowly won the duel.. and once he unified our lands under one Crown, each major faction was given a Principality - Navarre itself, then Aragon, Castile, and Asturias. Then, each major faction within was given a Duchy - Catalan, Valencia, Leon, Murcia, Toledo, Merida, Galicia, and Andalusia. While only a Navarran prince or princess could be king, the Royal Council consisted of the Dukes and Princes of the realm." He nodded, his eyes shut as he recited his history. "For long, the Castillians and the Navarese have had differences. To divide us would split us nearly in half. This marriage was cruicial." He sighed.

K: "Sounds like Tirek's style, to cut a wedge in a community just as they're trying to come together." I nodded. "How do the Herdiets play into this?"

Duke Condor: "They supported the Colectivistas. Mainly made up of disaffected lower class Castillians - Leonese and Galicians especially. This Civil War may have two main banners, but it is made up of everyone that has had disagreement with the last thousand years of history, each with their own flag. I myself represent my father's throne - the Carlian Family. My cousin represents the Alfonso Family, and their claim to the throne. Our king died of a broken heart six months after the struggle began, having lost everything. We have no clear claimant even to his throne - the Principality of Navarre itself. That is divided between the Carlians and the Alfonsos. Then, we have the Nationalists, who want no kings, but want a representative government only. We also have the National Syndicalists, who want a totalitarian form of government not unlike the Royal one, but with more representation and no patronomical inheritance of the role of leader. On the other side are the Colectivistas, but they also include the Galician Duchy's government that wants independence, and factions in the Valencian government who wish the same - they care less of how they are ruled, and more that they no longer wish to be in union with us." He used his table map to show us, roughly, where all this was - the map itself was pressed into the table as a cover pattern, and over a hundred years old.

K: "Like all Civil Wars, this is very messy." I nodded. "It's anything but Civil."

Duke Condor: "Si." He nodded slowly.

K: "And if NEIGHTO wants the support of your people, and your lands, we have to wade in and put a stop to the fighting. Somehow." I looked at Starlight. "Which isn't a purely military solution. I mean, it could be - we could simply inject enough military force into the region to kill everyone resisting that isn't on the side we choose to support. But, that would leave a LOT more dead. And that's counter-productive to the over-all fight against Tirek."

Starlight: "Yes. So, we'll have to find ways to mend fences with as many forces as possible. You did say this is more or less a war of two flags?" She tilted her head.

Duke Condor: "Si. General Falco has risen as the leader of the faction with which we cooperate. He was Commander of the 3rd Division of the Army when this conflict started. He is, however, nominally a Syndicalist.. though he has assured both myself and my cousin that, should we win, a King will be installed as a figurehead with nominal authority to maintain traditions." He frowned. "But, I know him - he craves power. He wants authority. He wishes to be the Supreme Leader of the nation."

K: "Oh, boy, this really reminds me of the Spanish Civil War in my world - though, I admit, there are differences here and there." I shook my head.

Duke Condor: "Would that, perhaps, mean you can be of greater assistance? That, perhaps, you know some of the.. potential.. political pitfalls we might approach?" He seemed very interested, swishing his horns a little.

K: "It does. In my world, the Spanish Civil War was called a dress rehearsal for the largest and most destructive war my world had ever experienced. About 3% of the entire human population, died in that war. Hundreds of millions of people." I nodded slowly. "So, I studied the Spanish Civil War very closely." I pointed at the map. "How much materiel support are the Collectivists receiving from the Herdiet Union, or People's Republic of Khyanga?"

Duke Condor: "Last week, my cousin's soldiers were attcked by an armored box with cannons." He lowered his head a little. "Many Ibex were killed, before one Ibex bravely jumped on it with much lit dynamite."

K: "Great. Someone's giving them tanks." I scowled. "This really IS going to be a Dress Rehearsal for the invasion of Tirek's homelands." And crossed my arms.

Starlight: "We need to get in touch with NEIGHTO - our friends should be arriving at the border, soon. We need more forces, here, and we need armored vehicles.. anti-tank weapons.." She looked at the Duchess. "And, I'm sure, medicine and food for the civilian population, and wounded."

K: "Moreover, I know one step that needs to be taken immediately - Falco HAS to go. Period." I looked at the Duke. "Be honest with me - how popular are you, and your cousin?"

Duke Condor: "Mmm.. Duke Alfonso and I were.. before this, we did not much associate with the other royals, nor the people. I had my lillies, he had his chickens and parrots.. we led simple lives, Mariscal. At Court, we did our best to think of the people.." He sighed deeply. "But, I admit I was out of touch. I am here by accidental events - when the assassination occured, my cousin and I were the ones physically in the same room as the King, and we and our personal attendants helped him escape. As troops defected and volunteers came to the King, my cousin and I helped organize them, lead them, fight.. resist." He lowered his head. "When my brother died.. he did not declare an Heir. Until that moment, it did not matter to my cousin and I who would be the next King, only that Alfonso WAS our king.. and we would die for him. Now.. both of us.. would die for Navarre and her people."

K: "Great. You know, one of the reasons Falco's human analogue managed to win the war and become unquestioned ruler of Spain in my world, was because he built a literal cult of personality around himself. He MADE himself popular." I looked at some of the soldiers outside. "I'm guessing, the majority of your goats follow you out of simple loyalty to the office of Duke."

Duke Condor: "Indeed they do - that and my lucky successes in battle. Of the major factions under Falco, my troops have performed the best and suffered the least. I admit, however, my instruction as a soldier ended with officer training and education at the Royal Military Academy. It is fairly basic instruction.." He trailed off. "..though, only those in the higher classes of society attend, and most of our enemies are not of that social class, so, my cousin and I have been successful in tactics only because our opponents are especially estupido." He chuckled a bit.

K: "Oohh.. I need to bring in my officers. If that's the case, your troops, combined with professional training, and expert officer instruction, could be deadly effective." I stood up. "Since my employer is a royal figure, Starlight, I think we can agree that the Crown of Equestria, at the very least, will support the Crown of Navarre - we will work out who's to be King at a later date." I gestured. "For the time being, I think, for diplomatic reasons, we will address the Crown of Navarre in the name of His Highness, King Alfonso VIII, represented by Duke Condor and Duke Alfonso."

Duke Condor: "..yes, yes, I see that as politically acceptable." He nodded, thoughtfully.

Starlight: "Interesting way to split hairs, K. I like it." She nodded slightly.

K: "Can you get your cousin to agree to a meeting? Soon?" I leaned over a bit, towards the Duke.

Duke Condor: "I think.. with this news, yes. Si! I shall send a messenger at once." He nodded. "Now, to get you back in touch with your people.." He looked towards the door. "..Maria, mi amore, get a guard to find me Lieutenant Espinoza. She can guide them."

Duchess Condor: "Si, mi amore." She got up and scooted off.

An interesting situation. If I let this go, the superior support given by Tirek's forces would no doubt have the lands fall to his control, giving him an invasion route through southern Prance. So, of course, I now have to wade in to a Civil War...

Part 2: Iberian Two-Step

LOCATION: South of Girul, Navarre

Lt. Espinoza: "This way." She said, surefootedly guiding us through the foothills that ringed the southern part of the town.

K: "Okay. We're close. Weapons free." I said, chambering a round in my Bradley. "Firecracker, comms." I held out my hand.

Firecracker: "Gotcha." She passed me the Mic.

K: C> "Alpha Actual to Alpha Team. How copy, over?"

Cosmic: C> "Alpha Team reads you, five by five. We're about a kilometer north of a town, on a small hill, downward slope. We followed your trail, Actual."

K: C> "Alpha Team, town is hostile. Repeat, town IS hositle, how copy, over?"

Cosmic: C> "Roger. Town is designated as Hostile. Initiating surveillance. Stand by, Actual."

Lt. Espinoza: "..and what do you plan to do, Mariscal?" She stopped, and looked at me with surprise.

K: "We're taking that town away from the enemy - it's the closest point to the Prench border. We need a base of operations. That town will be it." I nodded. "Get ready, everyone." I looked back to Espinoza. "You don't have to join us - I'm doing this on my own volition."

Lt. Espinoza: "No, no.. if you risk'a your life for my country, my risk is your risk." She nodded to me, and chamber-checked her CB-2 Rifle.

Interesting weapon - it bore resemblence to an early sketch prototype of the Patton rifle, but was clearly using 7x40mm NEIGHTO ammo. The stock was also a bit unusual, reminding me more of the Sherman's stock, than the Patton's. Ibex, being hooved creatures, used the same "lemon squeezer" triggers that Pony weapons did.

Cosmic: C> "Alpha Team to Actual."

K: C> "Go ahead."

Cosmic: C> "Count one company-sized formation of Gendarmes troops in the town, no support weapons. They are dug in, and seem to be expecting an assault from your side, General."

K: C> "Alpha Team, preapre to attack. Actual will come in from the south after you initiate. How copy, Alpha Team?"

Cosmic: C> "Orders received and understood, Actual. Ten mikes."

Starlight: "..I'm an Ambassador, not a combat soldier!" She snorted a bit, as Dusty passed her, her Morgan.

Dusty: "Hey, I was a cop, okay? We all gotta do our part - sometimes that means killing. We'll negotiate with their corpses." She also passed her, her spare magazines. "I hope you know how to use that."

K: "Havoc taught her." I nodded. "Speaking of." I grabbed the mic. C> "Alpha to Cognac and Hunter Actual."

Sacquet: C> "Oui, mon Marechal?"

Havoc: C> "Hey, buddeh!"

K: C> "Work with Alpha Team. I want you two on a flanking maneuver. Got me?"

Sacquet: C> "Oui, mon Marechal!"

Havoc: C> "Roger that!"

K: "I'll leave it up to whomever's in charge, more or less, to set that up. Everyone, wait for Alpha Team to start shooting and the defenders to abandon their positions, then we advance." I nodded to each of them.

Gorcat: "Ooo.. I was wondering if we'd have some fun!" He snickered, and racked his Abrams machine gun.

K: "Rarity, set yourself up." I nodded to her.

Rarity: "Of course, Darling. I get to show off my sniper skills.." She smirked and got into a covered position behind a flat rock.

After a few more minutes, I could hear the crack of Bella's Timberwolf sniper rifle, and I saw a goat's head explode. The defenders were stunned, for a moment, then started looking around for whomever fired the shot. A moment later, Rarity took her own shot from our position, and bagged another goat. Then another precision shot, I guessed Teddy, and another goat fell over, dead. Finally, the defenders got the idea they were under fire, and started to scatter, only for yet another markspony shot to take down an Officer.

I could see Havoc's wolves moving to the western edge of the town, and infiltrate the streets like shadows. Within about two minutes, there was shooting from both the east and west ends of town, then the sounds of wolves attacking in close quarters, and savagely ripping goats apart.

Lt. Espinoza: "My Word!" She recoiled a bit. "You have.. Canids?!"

K: "One of my best friends." I smirked. "Don't worry, stay next to me, they won't eat you. Let's go, everyone!" I ushured my small group forwards.

We charged forwards, weapons raised. I kept mine pointed forwards, looking for targets, but the enemy soldiers had all scattered like flies. I finally sighted one in, that was trying to direct troops, and put three rounds into its chest, sending it to the ground. I pivoted, and fired an HE shell from the Gavin into a sandbag pile, and blew it apart, sending three terrified goats running from it, and right into Havoc's team. All three were grabbed - from the left, then the right, then tackled straight down forwards - and eviscerated with wolf teeth.

I moved to the center of town, with Espinoza and Firecracker. Firecracker pointed to a cluster of enemy troops packed behind some crates and overturned carts.

K: "I'll drop an egg on 'em." I opened the Gavin and loaded a shell.

Firecracker: "No need, sir."

She focused her magic into her horn, it glowed RED with heat, and she summoned up a rack of magical bottle rockets, which she fired off at their position, one after another, like an MLRS. The impacts were Grenade-strength, and after firing twelve, there wasn't much left but small craters and body parts.

Sacquet: "EAST SIDE CLEAR!" He called out, from the edge of the Plaza.

Havoc: "WEST SIDE CLEAR!" He returned the call from the other side.

Norfy: "NORTH CLEAR!" He called out, approaching from the north side.

K: "South clear." I stated. "Bring it in, lads and lasses. Sweep the rest of the town for hold-outs. Then, we're having a meeting in that building there." I pointed to the Police Building we'd been detained at.

Now, the real challenge - wading in to a Civil War, picking a side, and helping them win not only the combat phase, but the peace phase.. then turning them around and getting them to help us fight Tirek. It did occur to me that, now, the Ibexians would be my most combat-experienced troops, after my own..

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Iberian Jam Session

TIME: 14:11 IT
DATE: DATE: War Day 732/6 Quartus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: South of Girul, Navarre

Almost everyone had come. Celestia was even here, though she'd stayed under cover when the shooting started. Forest Spirit and Blinda were at the planning table I'd set up.

K: "You guys must've had a lot of faith in me, that I'd be able to negotiate something.." I shook my head with a small grin.

Gaze: "'Snot that, suh." He smirked. "We all figger'd ye'd git yerself in a whole pile'a trouble, an' need a rescue." He nodded. "A big'un."

Celestia: "..indeed." She gave me a Mommy grin.

K: "Alright, alright.." I shook my head. "..anyway, the Dukes should be arriving about now.." I nodded to the door.

Lt. Espinoza: "Presenting their royal highnesses, Duke Alfonso and Duke Condor, representing the Royal Government of Navarre." She opened the door for them.

I saw Alfonso, and I saw a man of breeding and status. He was more filled out in an athletic way, than Duke Condor. He also seemed a bit younger. He was tan-coated, pegging him as a Southern Spanish Ibex. His uniform was slate grey, and he wore an oversized Gorro de Cuartel Cap with longer tassles, in addition to a cloak with a white underface.

I noted, also, that the main difference between them was that Alfonso's rank and ribbons were in blue, while Condor's were red. Both wore otherwise-identical uniform styles.

Duke Alfonso: "Ahh.. bon dia per a voste, Mariscal.." He then saw Celestia, and both he and Condor bowed to her. "La seva majestat! S¢c el Duc Alfons." He took her hoof, and nodded to it.

I noted Duke Alfons spoke Catalan, not Spanish/Navarese.

Duke Condor: "Your Majesty, you grace us with your presence. Duke Condor, m'lday." He took his turn accepting her hoof.

K: "These are the two I want to back. Ibexeria is in the throes of a Civil War, Your Highness." I shook my head. "Tirek is involved - we either pick a side and fight this war, or let him have an invasion route into southern Europe."

Celestia: "My GOODness..!" She was shocked at this. "I.. I had no idea." She turned to the Dukes. "I am sorry, I had no idea.."

K: "And it's kinda my fault this ended up being so bloody - they were the other customers of that espionage group we caught. They've copied my weapons designs and made their own." I nodded.

Celestia: "So, you want to have NEIGHTO - more specifically, Equestria - sponsor the royalists?" She looked at the Dukes.

K: "Yes, Cel. I do. They're the best bet we have of a strong government in the post-war era." I raised my head a bit, then looked at Duke Alfonso. "Duke Alfonso, my condolences on the loss of your family."

Duke Alfonso: "I thank you, Mariscal K. The King was the best of us, and his son, was our bright future flame." He shook his head. "I will say right now, Duke Condor and I have been talking - we both agree to jointly represent the Royal Government of Navarre as equals for the time being, in the name of the King." He nodded. "Living or dead, until another is crowned. In light of the possibility of receiving such aide, it is our duty as Royals to put the best interest of our Goats first, and our personal issues, last." He looked to Celestia and nodded to her. "You represent a real chance at victory. This.. this cannot be ignored."

Fluttershy: "Well. I'm glad the two of you can at least be friends.." She smiled warmly to them both.

Duke Condor: "Ah. Before the war, we were as friendly as one might expect - we saw each other in Court four times a year, perhaps went to family events together. Social, but not close." He shrugged a bit.

Duke Alfonso: "Indeed. Another failing of ours, Cousin." He put his hoof on Condor's shoulder. "I feel as though our inattentiveness only helped the enemies we didn't know we had."

Duke Condor: "On that, I can fully agree, Cousin." He put his own hoof on Alfonso's shoulder.

K: "Well, THIS is a good start." I nodded. "I was hoping you two would agree to this - now, perhaps, we can unite the other Nationalist groups under one fully unified banner, instead of multiple teams in general cooperation." I shook my head a bit.

Duke Condor: "We are Royals - it is our duty to put The People first. If we don't, we do not deserve their loyalty." He nodded.

K: "Now, the big issue." I nodded to Duke Alfonso. "Did Duke Condor explain that I'm from another world?"

Duke Alfonso: "He did.. but.." He gesutured. "..while I understand that humans must be violent creatures moreso than us - no offense, senyor -"

K: "None taken." I nodded.

Duke Alfonso: "- I don't quite understand what this means, beyond that you have the knowledge to produce firearms and conduct grand strategy." He gestured a bit, with one hoof.

K: "Put simply, this war you're engaging in, has a very, very close analogue in the human world. Moreover, many events in this world, match events in mine. Like a song that rhymes with another. It allows me to navigate perils that I know for certain will come up, by guiding events to a much better outcome. Siding with you two, for example? In my world, a man named Francisco Franco siezed control of the nation that mirrors Navarre, and continuously kept his rivals - you, for example - off balance and impotent. While Spain was a nice place, generally, during his rule, he built up a cult of personality that ensured Spain would begin to crumble again after his death. Which, in many ways, it did." I shrugged. "Your own General Fernando Falco? From what I understand, he's already started on that path. If he is permitted to crown himself supreme ruler of Navarre, yes, your people might have a few prosperous decades.. BUT.. afterwards?" I opened my hands and gently swung them out. "I doubt that he'd permit Navarre to have anything to do with any of the Pony kingdoms, and in our struggle against Tirek, provide only token support. The Pony kingdoms - not to mention the dragons - WILL remember this, and when Falco is gone, they won't forget that the Ibexians paid them mere lip service in exchange for blood and treasure. Which will lead to hard feelings, isolation on a growingly global community, and eventually, economic stagnation, as trade will virtually grind to a halt." I looked to both of them. "My counterpart to Navarre eventually avoided this by prostrating and degrading itself on the world stage with intentionally weak politics, dirty financial deals, and finally, humiliation as cowards, followed by a virtual Reconquista of their lands by foreign invaders, displacing the locals." I shook my head.

Duke Alfonso: "..my word." He suddenly became very serious. "If what you say is true in any measure.. what do we do?" He lifted his head to look at me. "General Falco is already seen as our most effective leader.. many soldiers respect him." He shrugged. "And he has agreed privately to restore the Throne, but as a mere figurehead.. the people would likely accept this." He looked between himself and Duke Condor. "Neither my cousin nor I have that kind of popular support. If the fighting were to stop now, with us as victors, no matter which side you supported for the Throne? Would not be accepted by many."

K: "Ah, see, there in lies the political problem." I nodded. "Falco has to go - and his exit must be graceful or entirely his own undoing." I gestured. "I can't simply shoot him - I'd be villified."

Duke Alfonso: "Mm.. so, what do you propose?" He swished his horns a little, in thought.

K: "First step? Make it clear that both of you are responsible for getting me, and my forces, involved. Second? Unite your camps." I pointed to the rank insignia. "Change the colors on your rank stripes and uniforms to the same color. Present a truly united front. That will push Falco off his spot by just a bit." I nodded slowly. "Go back to your people, tell them that the turning point in the war is here, and help has arrived. Claim this victory united, and in the name of the King, not yourselves."

Starlight: "I believe General K is directing the two of you to be joint leaders.." She nodded slowly. "..while our officers will be eminence grise." She smirked very slightly. "Trained NEIGHTO officers and soldiers intermixed with your own, helping lead them, teach them. You've admitted that war isn't your thing, that you've been lucky - we can turn that luck into concrete success. Not simply raiding enemy supplies and units, but taking territory and holding it."

Rarity: "Indeed, Darlings." She smiled, somewhat haughtily. "And if I read my cards right, I don't believe Falco will be as.. accepting.. of outside help. Leaving him trailing behind in victories and success. No one need know that you two are being directly advised by General K. And if anyone asks? You keep him around to show him how YOU do things." And it curled into a smirk.

Duke Condor: "Ahh.. some intrigue." He grinned. "But, I do like the idea of it." He looked to his cousin, and stuck out his hoof. "Partners?"

Duke Alfonso: "Partners." And they shook on it. "We will settle the ultimate question at a later time."

K: "Excellent." I nodded to both of them. "Celestia, you return with a few of the General Staff and start mobilizing support - I want the entire First Division of the Royal Army here, I know it will come piecemeal, but I want them here. Have the assembly point be Banger, Maine. Request Militia from Docksylvania and Erie, I'm sure they'll love to come. Naval forces for escort only, we'll land at.." I looked to Sacquet.

Sacquet: "Bayonne would be the closest port to Equestria, mon Marechal." A small grin. "The closest port to here would be Perpignan. Around the Ibexerian Peninsula."

K: "Perpignan will be faster, for now. Have the 1st Airborne Brigade assemble at Banger/North Woods AFB, and have them prepared to drop by Regiment - Webley, I want you there, but I want you in on the first wave." I nodded to her. "Starlight, request a full battalion each from the NEIGHTO partners, as well as ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Let them know that Tirek is here, and that's our main objective. Have them assemble at Bayonne - that'll be our assembly area for NEIGHTO partner units."

Starlight: "Of course, K." She nodded a bit.

Webley: "Any time, General." She gave me a broad, ready-steady grin.

K: "Lastly, I want a Marine Brigade - Blinda, pick our least experienced one, and embark them on landing ships. When the time comes to sieze a Navarran port, I want them leading the operation, and you in command." I nodded.

Blinda: "Of course, K." She puffed herself up a bit.

K: "Sacquet, when the Prench forces arrive, I want you in command of them directly." I nodded to him.

Sacquet: "Oui, mon Marechal." He smirked.

K: "Havoc, I want your Rangers to start training both Alfonso and Condor's troops. Picking the best ones, forming a Special Operations detachment of goats from both teams." I nodded to him.

Havoc: "You got it, ol' buddy." He gave me a toothy grin.

K: "Alright, let's get moving. This is going to be a tougher fight than usual - our opponents will be a LOT like us. Smart, tough, and adapted to the terrain. Not a meat grinder like Neighpon, a real thinking soldier's challenge." I nodded.

As my officers and Ambassador dispersed, I could see real hope in the Dukes' eyes.. probably for the first time in two years.

Part 4: Iberian Waltz

TIME: 09:11 IT
DATE: DATE: War Day 734/8 Quartus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Girul, Navarre

Our home base was being fully established with elements of the Prench Army's 1st Field Engineer Regiment. They were the nearest unit to the border, along with two platoons of Prench border guards. Artillery emplacements were being constructed, and defenses raised.

Cosmic: "So, this is another mess we've gotten into." He sighed, and shook his head. "And again, we didn't know."

K: "Tirek has the advantage of being able to strike a hundred places at once with minimal forces, and stir up trouble. Strife and tensions long buried, or made from wholecloth. And all he needs to do is send a few advisors and maybe smuggle some weapons or magical items. Whereas we? We have to commit serious force to each operation he drags us into. He can take advantage of local forces to do his general bidding - weaken us and drain our resources - whereas we have to prevent new fronts from opening up, secure our borders, and extract more resources than we expend. With Neighpon, every day that passes, we gain more than we lost in the fighting. Same here, I hope." I shrugged to the side.

Norfy: "I wonder if Tirek's goal here was to invade NEIGHTO? Before it even formed. Knock out our potential allies before we even had them?" He nodded to me.

K: "I think that's what he was hoping for. The fighting started, here, about two months after the war began. I have a feeling that his limited force, here, got bogged down. And when we started achieving victories over him, he got stuck - he couldn't rescind his support but, once we took Carousel Island, he couldn't provide much more. Unknowingly, we kneecapped his operations here, I think - he was probably hoping for a faster victory and a chance to engage Prance before they could raise a hoof to help us, which likely would have drawn in Ambleon, and Germaneigh. Occupying three of the largest now-NEIGHTO nations." I nodded as we moved to the edge of town. "And in a disorganized manner - and this before we started sending them firearms. It would have been a slaughter."

Forest Spirit: "So. First objectives?" He came up beside us.

K: "Once we get ground troops here, I want to start siezing cities and towns. Simple expansion, gradual, but unrelenting. Don't give them time to breathe. Air support from the Prench Air Force will be limited, but they do have 26 fighter-bombers ready to go. Heavy air support won't be possible until we can move our own assets to Maine." I shrugged widely. "Hey, I guess that's the benefit of the two continents being so close - we can launch air strikes from our own soil."

Forest Spirit: "And the local forces?" He led in.

K: "Everyone that's here right now, we train them according to our standards. Raise Ranger, Light Infantry, and Cavalry units. As we get equipment from our own stocks and NEIGHTO, we raise Artillery, Armored Cavalry, and Anti-Tank Gun units. Nobody has planes to spare, yet, so we can't give them an Air Force. I would, though, like to see about siezing some smaller vessels and mounting light guns to them, to use as Patrol Gun Boats." I gestured into my open palm. "We have about a week before we get enough forces here to mount a serious offensive. General Falco is occupied with his own concerns farther south of here - I intend to meet up with him only after we've accomplished something big."

Forest Spirit: "Got it." He nodded. "Cosmic, Norfy, Gaze, let's go - we need numbers. Personnel counts, ammo, weapons, uniforms, the works."

The lads paced off with Forest Spirit, leaving Firecracker and Applejack with me.

K: "I wanted to ask, Firecracker. About that Horn Magic of yours." I nodded.

Firecracker Burst: "Ehhh.." She blushed, and rubbed her fetlock behind her head. "..they can get pretty spicy. If I focus my magic a certain way, they can be deadly. If I don't, they aren't. That make sense?"

Applejack: "Shore does, sugarcube." She patted her on the back. "An' it's a right nice power t'have. Y'all're portable artillery!"

Firecracker Burst: "Yeah, yeah.. I guess I am!" She grinned.

Applejack: "Hey, sugarcube, it'll be right nice t'have yer kinda help." She gave her a short nuzzle of reassurance.

Firecracker Burst: "Thanks." She blushed a bit, and I could see a little fizzle around her horn. "It's hard, sometimes, to control it. I mean, if I get excited.." She shrugged.

Applejack: "Ye'll be fahn." She gave her a beaming grin.

K: "AJ's right." I nodded. "You're in the best place to make the best use of your talents."

Firecracker Burst: "Thanks." She nodded.

Over the next several days, we would integrate and retrain Alfonso and Condor's troops. It was like training my first Rangers all over again. Many had seen fighting, but all had more or less learned their skills on the job, and some of their bad habits were hard to break.

One thing, that really stuck with me, because of the world I was in.. was this predilection for hoarding and not sharing.

I actually had to have Fluttershy and Rarity sit down with them and explain its importance in a combat environment and within one's unit. I found out that these soldiers were pretty much on their own in a lot of ways. They'd join up, usually with several others within their family or town, be assigned together as a unit, given uniforms, and told they'd have to acquire everything else themselves. Food, ammunition, even weapons.

This became clear when a gaggle of Goats showed up from Alfonso's base camp, armed with farming tools, and nothing else.


TIME: 11:33 IT
DATE: DATE: War Day 736/10 Quartus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Camp Liberty, Girul, Navarre


K: "Take a look at these recruits.." I nodded to Forest Spirit and Havoc.

Twelve Goats came pacing into the camp in basic Navarese Royal Faction uniforms. No ranks, no weapons, no basic gear. Just the uniforms, and farm tools - a couple of Adzes, a couple Billhooks, an axe, and some pitchforks.

Forest Spirit: "We've seen some rather poorly equipped units so far.. but.." He shook his head.

Havoc: "Wasn't one of the Navarese troops saying this is how everyone starts off?" He lifted his head.

Forest Spirit: "Yeah." He scowled a bit. "Because units don't share their equipment. Sometimes, even with each other."

K: "Spirit, go make contact with them and get them over here." I was holding a clipboard listing available supplies and gear - the Prench had sent over all their re-re-reconditioned Patton Rifles (that now actually FUCKING WORKED) as military aid, and we were passing them out to units that lacked weapons.

Forest Spirit: "You got it, bro." He toddled over. "Hey! ¡Buenos Dias, Amigos! Over here." He motioned to the supply tables we were next to.

Havoc: "Good accent." He sniffed.

K: "Forest can speak Navarese natively." I nodded. "His uncle served in the Navarese army at one point. A lot of Ironish expats did. They're really the only ponies that ever had contact with the Navarese."

They came walking over, and a leader immediately took their place in front of them - he was older, perhaps 50, and had an impressive braided beard.

Demetrio: "Demetrio Garcia." He stated, to me, as he approached. "We are sent by Duke Alfonso." He shuffled a bit, in a challenging manner. "He say to report to the Human."

K: "I'm he." I nodded. "This is Commandant Forest Spirit, and Captain Havoc."

Demetrio: "Si. Where do we fight? My goats need things, we have little rations left, and we need to take many things from our enemies." He snorted a tiny bit, very unsure of me.

Havoc: "Oh, that's not how we do things any more." He shook his head a bit. "We're going to issue you equipment."

Demetrio: "How? We have no peso to pay for it!" He narrowed his eyes at me, expecting some kind of trick.

K: "It's a gift from the North Equus Independent Group of Herds Treaty Organization. All of it. Food, too." I nodded, reassuringly, ducking my head a little in a manner a goat would interperet as a non-threat.

Demetrio: "..a gift?" He pulled his head back, blinking.

K: "Yes, Amigos. We have come to help you take your homes back, and end this war. You can't stand on your own four hooves without proper gear, training, logistical support, and a little help." I stuck my hand out to shake limbs with him. "We want you to have your homes back. Everything. We can't replace the lives lost in this war, but we can help you end it."

Demetrio looked at my hand a moment, then put his right foreleg in it, and shook.

Demetrio: "Si. This is good." He raised his head proudly. "We are from the Village of Monterey. These are my nephews, niece, and my son, Diego."

K: "You have a pretty good sized unit, here. We'll organize you into 14th Company, they have people from that region." I nodded slightly. "And as you seem to have the respect and loyalty of your troops, I'll make you a Corporal."

Maria Garcia: "Uncle is also an educated man." She slipped up from the back rank, and nodded to me. "He can read and write." She smiled at both me and Forest Spirit. "As can I."

K: "Excellent." I nodded.. and realized Maria was looking at both me and Forest Spirit rather.. interestedly. "Applejack, honey!" I called out for my rescue..

Applejack: "Yeah, honeybun?" She came over with a load of musette bags for the supply table. Seeing the Navarese soldiers, she straightened up. "Howdy, y'all! I'm Applejack!" She beamed them a grin, and nuzzled my side. "This here's mah husband."

Maria looked disappointed immediately, and didn't even try to hide it. Demetrio caught sight of this and hissed quietly to her in Navarese something about looking for a husband elsewhere. I think.

Forest Spirit smirked hard, trying to keep a straight face, understanding what was said, better, and in context.

Applejack kept her smile, but she shot me a look - one that told me I'd done the right thing.

K: "Demetrio. Let's get your soldiers equipped, eh?" I diverted the situation.

So, now, we would be training the army. And with Falco much further south, preoccupied with his own glory, we could do so in peace..

Part 5: Iberian Ska

TIME: 12:35 IT
DATE: War Day 736/10 Quartus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Camp Liberty, Girul, Navarre


I had Demetrio and his two Squads sit and eat at the "mess hall" (which, at the moment, was just an area with tent canvas covering 3/4ths of the area). Lunch today was Chilindron (I noted they substituted the Lamb, for zucchini) and Chile Relleno, but using bell peppers instead of standard Poblano chiles. The side dish was some kind of salad, and interestingly, they had cooked oats. Some Valencio oranges were also supplied.

I noted that Oats appeared in just about every culture here, so far, and virtually all cultures (save Dragon and Griffon) were very heavy on the vegetables.

Demetrio and his family troop were digging in, and while my Navarese is less developed than my Germane, I could tell they were somewhat surprised by this. I figured that, since soldier volunteers tended to keep to their family unit or friends they signed up with, there was a lot of forage going on.

Applejack: "Mm.. these here stuffed peppers ain't bad. Bit spicy!" She, nonetheless, was eating heartily.

I shocked her when I added a bit of hot sauce to mine. It wasn't Roach Coach Street Tacos, but the flavor profile was a welcome reminder of my Human home.

Applejack: "Ain't that.. a bit hot?" She blinked.

K: "Nah, I've had hotter. We haven't run across any really strong Jalapenos, yet. Give me a few of those and some cream cheese, and I can make Jalapeno Poppers. Those'll clear your sinuses." I smirked.

Sacquet: "Mon Marechal." He took a seat across from me. "Interesting foods, they have. Much more spice than I am used to, but not entirely unpleasant." He shrugged. "I admit, I tend to add salt, or dip in vinegar."

K: "Spice isn't for everyone. French cuisine is generally very rich, but cold." I gestured.

Sacquet: "Indeed. So.." He nodded to Garcia's unit. "..our newest arrivals?"

K: "I think they joined up in the last week or so. They had absolutely nothing." I shrugged a bit, chewing the delicious spicy food. "After this, I want to personally take them through getting their gear and equipment. The repaired Pattons are working well enough."

Sacquet: "Oui. Fusil Modèle de 1002, et modifié. Reconditioned at St. Ettienne Arsenal." He insisted, taking a bite of salad. "I am glad we can provide proper arms to our Legion, now."

K: "Indeed." I nodded. "It's kinda interesting how far those Pattons have come, considering we only used them a very short time. The only real battle they were involved in, was Chowsin Ridge." I shrugged a bit. "Appleloosa and Springfield Arsenals are going to be sending a few thousand reconditioned Shermans in 7mm NEIGHTO. See.. that weapon.. we expended a lot of resources on."

Applejack: "Didn't have much'a choice, hun. It's all ya came with." She lazed into my side a bit as she ate.

K: "The Sherman Mk. VI is the rear receiver and front handguard of an old Mk. I Sherman, with the magazine well of a Sniper Sherman added, and the barrel of a Bradley. It's all off-the-shelf. Considering how many we had, I thought it best to be able to recondition them for military aid and maintain NEIGHTO compatibility." I gestured to Sacquet with my fork. "They weren't ready to go until long, long after we first met - or I'd've brought some with, if I could." I shook my head. "I still-"

Sacquet: "Non, mon ami. Do not blame yourself." He nodded firmly to me. "You are not a God, you cannot stop every misdeed, even with your own inventions."

Applejack: "Phillipe's right, hun." She fixed me with a look as she took a bite.

I gestated on that, but I would still feel like at least a few more of the Legion would be alive if I'd stopped that.


TIME: 12:35 IT

Out at the Equipment Building, which used to be the school house. Garcia's troops had already been given musette bags and magazine pouches for NEIGHTO magazines - essentially, their personal carry equipment.

Now, weapons. And helmets.

Cosmic: "Ah, step right up, folks." He nodded. "K." He nodded to me with a grin.

K: "Coz. What've we got?" I looked over the weapon crates we DID have.

Cosmic: "We have 76 modified Pattons left, sir, and 14 Sniper Shermans, all ex-Prench aid. We're expecting Sherman-6's in two days, along with some heavier stuff." He nodded to me.

K: "Draw me 12 Pattons and 2 Sniper Shermans. I'll return the extra. Ten mags per Goat, if we've got it." I nodded.

He pulled out the needed rifles, and sorted through the remaining magazines, coming up with just enough. He also set out a crate of 7x40mm NEIGHTO bullets, and four magazine loaders. I gestured to Demetrio.

K: "Grab a rifle, ten magazines, and 6 boxes of bullets each. This will be your Combat Load." I nodded to him. "Your two Squads will each have two Mag Loaders. Keep them safe, it makes loading magazines much easier."

Demetrio got his goats to collect the weapons, and once they did, I gestured for him to follow me. Bella was at the range, and another Squad was just finishing up.

Bella: "K!" She nodded, and grinned at Demetrio. "Greetings! I'm Sergeant Bella Donna, Canidan Royal Rangers."

Demetrio: "We have wolves on our side?" He seemed surprised.

K: "Yes, Demetrio. Because more friends means less suffering. Remember, Demetrio - Friendship is Magic, and with that magic, we can overcome anything." I patted his shoulder. "Bella, get them set up. I need to pick a Marksgoat per Squad."

Bella Donna: "Okay. Take your weapons, and everyone take five of the loaded magazines from the table." She instructed.

As they did, she nodded to Panters, who changed the targets.

Bella Donna: "Alright. Load the magazine into the rifle like so." She demonstrated. "And pull back on the knob, here." She did it like a pony - with her mouth. "The bolt on these are large enough that you might be able to do it with your hoof in an emergency." She nodded. "Alright. Now, be very aware that your weapon is ready to fire - do NOT point it at anything you don't want to make dead. Not even as a joke. Be very aware of where the tip of your barrel is pointing at all times."

Demetrio accentuated something about whupping them good if they forgot this safety rule.

Bella continued with the basic safety briefing, showing them how to change magazines quickly, and what the bolt release would do. She inserted a sentence in every paragraph spoken, about being careful with the weapons. Constant reminder, and repeating herself.

Bella Donna: "K? Would you demonstrate? Show them what a real master can do?" She gave me a toothy pupper grin.

K: "Surely." I nodded, and picked up a Canidan C-7.

The weapon being more ergonomic to me, it was easy for me to run the bolt, aim, and fire on the target Panters had put up at 50 meters, and hit the "ten" ring easily, and repeatedly.

K: "Keep in mind, Demetrio-and-Family, I invented these." I nodded slowly to them. "These are the kinds of weapons of war that my world has already. While I've never fired them myself, until I came here, I understood everything else I could about them."

Demetrio: "Ahaha.." He nodded. "And those two rifles you haves there?" He nodded to the Sniper Shermans.

K: "Precision Rifles for precision shooting. Every basic Infantry squad should have one marksgoat.. or markspony.. or markswolf." I nodded to Bella. "As they get better at their craft, they can become Snipers - that's a fusion of extremely precise shooting, and bushcraft, along with some other elements mixed in."

Bella Donna: "We're going to have you fire these rifles a bit over the next couple of days, and see which among you would make the best use of a precision rifle." She nodded. "A sharp shooter should be able to precisely engage targets beyond the expected range of your standard rifles."

K: "For the time being, let's see how you handle them. You each have one loaded magazine. Come to the firing line." I directed, remembering the time I spent training the first Rangers.. Berry's face came to my mind, and I had to clear my throat a bit.

They did as instructed, and stood as ordered.

K: "Raise up, aim at your target, and fire on your own time. Remember - if you have a failure of any kind, lay your rifle down, with the barrel aimed towards the target." I shrugged slightly. "While I can verify these weapons are perfectly functional, nothing in life is perfect."

Demetrio: "You heard him!" He indicated. "Now, fire!"

I watched as the twelve goats fired at a steady pace, semi-automatic only. They could all hit the target at this range, which was plenty good enough. 50 meters is generally standard engagement range in urban combat. I noticed Demetrio's niece and his son were both hitting in the 10-ring each time.

I had a feeling, I'd found my sharpshooters.

If Demetrio's unit was any indication, we were well on our way to having a professional land army for the Dukes, in no time at all.
