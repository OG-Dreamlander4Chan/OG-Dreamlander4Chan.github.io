Part 1: Rules for Order

DATE: 7 Septimus, 1001 C.S.

Equestria had the arms. Next, it needed an army to wield them.

I cautioned Celestia about the dangers of having too much power and what it might do. That my human influence might inadvertently cause her to desire more than she has - that she might become what she fears most, a despot. That in mind, she had me go over the training requirements of the Royal Guard. I decided that the Guard Pony that I'd met before (Steelhoof) would became my model soldier. I duplicated Freidrich von Steuben's "Model Company" idea on a smaller scale. A Model Soldier, that then trained a Model Squad. The Model Squads were then trained together to make a Model Platoon and then a Model Company.

Steelhoof was going to be trained specifically to be a basic Infantry soldier. As I had a partial copy of Rogers' Rules for Ranging and von Steuben's Blue Book in text form on my phone, I had Spike transcribe them before my battery ran dead, and I simply worked with what I had, adapted to the use of semi-automatic rifles and advanced combat tactics developed after World War II, Korea, and Vietnam that I remembered offhand.

Steelhoof. I can't say enough how valuable he was to the early formation of the Equestrian Military. He was one of the most senior Royal Guards in the standard Royal Guard force. Celestia and Luna both had their own individual Guard formations for ceremonial reasons, but then, there was the standard Royal Guard. As I understood it, Twilight's brother was the commander, but he was involved with something having to do with the Crystal Kingdom.

So, I focused on Steelhoof.

I came to the Palace with four Shermans and four Lees, now carrying my own personal Lee instead of my PA-63, since Equestrian 9x18mm ammo was not the same as 9x18mm Makarov.

Steelhoof: "The Princess said I should report to you, human." He said, as we both arrived at the training area together.

K: "Yeah.. uh.. Steelhoof.." I tilted my head. "Sorry, I've been so wrapped up in the logistics of getting things ready, we didn't have much time to get acquainted before now."

Steelhoof: "It is fine." He nodded stiffly. "Now. What.. what purpose will I serve?"

K: "You're going to be my Model Soldier. I'm going to teach you everything I possibly can about warfare, and you're going to then take that knowledge and train, first, one Squad of the Royal Guard, then they will train a Company, and so on." I nodded sagely.

Steelhoof: "Alright." He nodded. "You expect me to call you 'sir'?"

K: "Not unless you feel I've earned it." I nodded right to him.

Steelhoof: "Fair enough." He raised his head a little, with a tiny grin. "How do we start?"

K: "We start by me showing you what your new weapon is." I pulled one of the Shermans out, and held it up, with the bolt open. "This is the Sherman Rifle."

My weapon was a mutant - outward basic appearance of a Mauser Cavalry Carbine with an elongated grip area that also functioned as the trigger when squeezed, with the magazine body something like an upscaled copy of the FEG PA-63, complete with a little shoe on the bottom. The stocks were wood, with a metal butt plate and a leather cap over it. Sized for Ponies, though, I could use one if I had to. The magazine release was a simple paddle near the magazine, with the magazine (of course) forward of the grip area.

Steelhoof: "I remember seeing what that.. toy.. of yours could do." He nodded. "This is bigger."

K: "Bigger and longer ranged." I hefted it slightly. "This is the ammo." I pulled out a magazine, and extracted a bullet from it. "9x35mm. It has a maximum effective range of about 200 meters. That is, you can hit a target half the time at that range from a bench rest." I set the bullet down so he could inspect it. "The bullet is 8 grams, and travels at 570 meters per second."

Steelhoof: "A tiny thing going very fast." He cocked a brow.

K: "Mm. Yes, but watch this." I nodded to the range I'd had set up.

I faced down range, and stuck my wax plugs into my ears, then loaded the rifle with the magazine I'd pulled out. I tugged the bolt, and let it slide home with an authoritative klunk. I raised and aimed the weapon at the first target - a watermelon. I squeezed the whole-hand trigger firmly, and let the round fly. The watermelon exploded into chunks.

Steelhoof: "Ahh.. okayyy.." He winced at the loud sound, and recoiled a bit at the fruit assassination.

K: "Its effect on meat - that is, living creatures - isn't quite so impressive, but quite effective." I pointed to the small pen with pigs in it.. LIVE pigs.

Steelhoof: "Are we.. going to shoot those?" He tilted his head at them.

K: "YOU are." I nodded to him. "But, not just yet. You need to learn how to handle this thing, first." I hefted it in the crook of my arm, barrel pointed down, and nodded to him. "I must ask.. do you have doubts about it?"

Steelhoof: "Only that we can produce enough of them for our needs." He raised his head in respect, a tiny grin. "These are.. certainly.. just as effective as magic."

K: "And they can't be knocked out of action by anti-magic fields, and they can be used by ANYPONY.. any.. pony." I drove that point home. "Any Pegasi, any Earth Pony, any Unicorn. This makes all the races truly equals."

Steelhoof: "..indeed it does." He pondered this a moment. "I can't believe I didn't think of that.. but that's not usually my concern." He nodded. "You are right. With these, no matter the Guard, they need not fear mystical enemies.. or.. any enemies."

K: "Only with the correct training." I nodded firmly. "Speaking of, let's go over the Rules."

Steelhoof: "Indeed." He nodded firmly.

K: "Rule Number 1. Treat every weapon as though it's loaded. Only after you verify its condition, can you be more at ease with it. Rule Number 2. Do not aim this at anything you aren't willing to destroy - even when empty. As for empty, see Rule Number 1. Toying around with these, even when empty, can breed slovenly attitudes towards the danger these represent, and could lead to accidents through negligence." I nodded to him.

Steelhoof: "Oh, indeed!" He nodded a bit. "By having such a careless attitude, someone might casually play around with a weapon they presume empty.. when it isn't.."

K: "I can't tell you how many people have been injured or killed because they failed to adhere to these rules. Humans may be masters of warfare, but we have our share of carelessness and idiocy as well." I shrugged. "We're by no means perfect." I nodded to him. "Rule Number 3 in the human world is to keep your finger.." I flexed mine. "..off the trigger until you're ready to shoot. However, because of your.. ergonomics.. the entire grip is the trigger. So, we'll say Rule Number 3 is to keep your weapon on safety and pointed in a safe direction until you're ready to shoot."

Steelhoof: "Yes, uhm.." He lifted his right foreleg, and flexed at the fetlock. "..I see what you mean."

K: "Rule Number Four. Be sure of your target, and what's beyond it." I pointed to the fruit and vegetables on the range. "See? Look." A squirrel had come out to collect chunks of watermelon that I'd heartlessly executed. "That squirrel's no threat to us.. we wouldn't want to shoot them by mistake, now would we?"

Steelhoof: "Ah..! Indeed!" He nodded.

K: "Rule Number Five. Alcohol and Guns do not mix." I tapped the table. "EVER." And raised my head. "If you want to tie one on after hours, that's on you. But never show up to duty while intoxicated."

Steelhoof: "Common sense." He shrugged. "But, I understand the caution."

K: "Rule Number Six. Maintain your weapon. Clean, orderly, inspected before use or storage to ensure function." I nodded.

I removed the magazine, ran the bolt to clear it, then showed him the disassembly function - a catch on the handguard to remove it, then a push-pin in the front to unlock it and slide the barrel and upper forwards. Removing the bolt handle by unscrewing it, the bolt is slid out. The trigger mechanism comes out in one piece.

K: "These are the major components of the rifle. Each soldier will be expected to be able to take it apart to this level, then clean it with approved materials." I nodded. "As you're their leader, you'll have to inspect the weapons and ensure they've been cleaned, and oil applied as needed."

Steelhoof: "I see.." He examined the parts, picking up the barreled upper, and looking down the barrel from the rear. "Amazing machines."

K: "And they stay amazing as long as they're properly maintained." I nodded. "In addition to the Main Six rules, civilians should also observe four other rules for additional safety. That is, not to climb obstacles with loaded weapons, unload weapons when not in use, store weapons and ammo separately, and store weapons and ammo securely. Now, I don't expect you have break-ins and home invasion robbery-murders here that often-"

Steelhoof: "Goodness! NEVER!" He was shocked I'd even use those words like that.

K: "-well, just the same, a weapon being stored for home defense can be kept loaded and relatively unsecured, as long as it's under the control of a responsible person. That is, holstered on them, or if a rifle, within half a meter of them at all times, and not able to be simply grabbed up by an irresponsible pony, or a child." I nodded sagely to him. "Children are lost every day because humans don't secure their weapons properly. A very small child can, and will, find the gun and cause an accident with it, if it's not under strict control of an adult or responsible older teen. Irresponsible teens cause accidents, too. So, when storing a weapon in a home with a child, it should be secured as best as possible. Every precaution taken. And children should be taught from as young an age as possible how to be responsible, and more importantly, respectful, of firearms and what they can do if used improperly or mishandled."

Steelhoof: "I can imagine." He paused and lowered his head. "Rather.. I'd prefer not to." He blinked. "Have you seen such tragedy?"

K: "Sort of. Someone that was friends with a cousin had an accident with a low powered air rifle, and shot himself in the chest. The bullets in those are tiny and have only enough power to kill things like that squirrel, so his life was in no danger, but he did have to have surgery to remove it. It also hurt. A lot." I nodded to him. "The potential for danger with firearms is the reason why some humans would prefer no one has them." I shrugged. "As with Magic, it's a tool - nothing more, nothing less. I can imagine what might happen if a young pony were to accidentally awaken, say, fire magic inside a barn filled with hay."

Steelhoof: "That.. that has happened before." He nodded a bit. "I.. when I was a youth, my best friend had something similar to them.. they.. managed to escape, but their family lost a great deal." He shook his head. "I see, now, the parallels."

K: "It's important to remember, also, that just like Magic, the absolute right to poses's weapons like this.. is freedom. So long as the populace maintains the ability to overthrow a government that becomes despotic and cruel, there is a balance. If the government ever takes those means away from the populace, they're doing so because they're about to do something the populace would need them to resist. There's a saying in my world - when the Government fears the People, there's Liberty. When the people fear the Government, there's tyranny." I nodded to him, going a bit into the philosophical.

Steelhoof: "Given humans have no magic, I can.. I can understand the desire and need to have something to protect oneself with." He nodded. "That's why Equestria.. has us.." He looked down at his uniform. "..and, now, The Elements of Harmony."

K: "That's on a grand scale." I nodded to him. "You can't be everywhere. You can't un-maul or un-kill somepony that's wandered into the woods and run across a Manticore or something like that."

Steelhoof: "True enough, human. And.. if we were to be controlled or subverted, we could be used against ponykind.." He blinked again. "Your world has many dangers.. we seem to share them." He nodded to the side. "We were simply blind to their existence."

K: "Exactly. Now, let's get to practice." I nodded firmly.

[End of Part 1]

Part 2: The Hunter and the Teacher


DATE: 9 Septimus, 1001 C.S.


Training Steelhoof on the Sherman wasn't an issue. He took to it well enough. By the end of the first day, he could engage the targets at the practice range I'd set up, out to 150 meters, or, the expected engagement range of the Sherman. That's about 500 feet, or, 164 yards - about one and two thirds of the length of a football field.

The German Army in World War II discovered that the average engagement range of rifle infantry in combat rarely exceeded 300 meters. This, along with an earlier study dating back to 1918, led to the development of the STG-44. I took into account a few more things learned in the interim - that urban or suburban combat would be more likely than open field combat, that in open field combat the individual riflepony would/should have access to Close Air Support or some other form of off-battlefield supporting fire (I was starting to design some light artillery pieces and mortars when I had time), and in urban combat, ranges would be significantly less.

I also took into account the size of the soldiers in my future army - ponies are somewhere around 3/4ths of Human scale. Thus, engagement ranges and everything else would be effectively reduced by that amount. Going by the original 1918 study, I should expect rifle engagement ranges to no more than 600 meters maximum, and 225 or less to be most common. I preferred the idea that Marksponies be the ones to precisely engage targets at that range, since the average person - pony, human, whatever - isn't going to be able to precisely hit a pony-sized target with simple iron sights at that range with any surety. So, I designed the weapon to fit a range envelope of 150 meters for combat shooting, perhaps 200 from a solid brace, with simple non-adjustable iron sights.

Now, we moved from shooting static targets.. to the nuts and bolts of infantry warfare.

K: "Okay, Steelhoof.. you can shoot. Now, I'm going to teach you how to move like Infantry." I nodded slowly. "I know you received some kind of field training as a Royal Guard.."

Steelhoof: "..which mainly consisted of physical conditioning and fitness. Marching dozens of kilometers in disciplined order, making camp, breaking camp, assembling in ordered rows, and charging enemy troops." He shrugged. "We DO have archers, but those are mainly Pegasi, and they just.." He raised a hoof overhead. "..fly around and pick off targets."

K: "Ah, so you DO have some kind of military function." I nodded.

Steelhoof: "To a degree. We haven't been used in a very, very long time, human." He nodded slowly. "Then, of course, we rely on Unicorn mages to break the enemy formation, charge in, and take them prisoner if we can."

K: "Strange." I shrugged. "Well, I'm going to teach you how to advance in cover, assault an enemy position, and KILL the enemy." I pointed to him. "If you're going to function as a true military force, your objective should be to neutralize your opponent. There's no more effective way to do that, than to shoot them until they stop moving. You MUST go in with the mentality that you're going to KILL them." I was adamant about this.

Steelhoof: "I.." He lowered his head. "..I'm not sure I'm ready for that."

K: "I thought as much. And I'm not upset. This is a world where conflict is rare, where violence is almost unheard-of. Where the sanctity of life is respected by all who live in it, at least to some degree." I shook my head. "You were never meant to be ready for true violence."

Steelhoof: "Then, I must ask.. why?" He shrugged.

K: "Me." I pointed to myself. "Nothing has come down from On High to send me back to where I came from. Discord claims he brought me here. I very nearly killed him - he did not lift a finger to send me BACK to where I came from, even then. And he could have. My capacity for violence is as much a part of me as my fingers and my toes. If I'm still here, there's some kind of cosmic reason for it. And I and Celestia are convinced that violence in some manner is on the horizon. We don't know what it is. So, we must be ready for anything. What if it's some kind of ghoulish creatures? Or.. I don't know.. monsters. Creatures about your size factor, up to or larger than mine, that want to harm or kill all ponies?"

Steelhoof: "I see what you mean.." He nodded, pondering.

K: "Mm..! And if this is to happen, I alone can't stop an army. Neither could the Elements. Only an army can stop an army - and every army starts with one soldier, with one rifle. I'm here, my knowledge is here, and it would be idiocy to think that the cosmic beings that exist wouldn't yank me out of here to preserve the innocence of this place.. unless I was here for the specific reason to prepare this world with the knowledge that I have." I gestured as I spoke.

Steelhoof: "The knowledge to create weapons. And train an army to use them." He nodded back. "The mere existence of Celestia and her sister and their powers are proof enough that great powers exist.. and.. you are right, it seems foolish of them to allow you to exist here if there wasn't a specific reason.." He hefted his Sherman. "..these."

K: "Exactly. Now, let's go. I've planned some instructional exercises." I led him away from the weapons table.

The next two days were spent going over infantry tactics. I simulated assaults on enemy positions, bypassing stronger enemy forces, sneaking, engaging dynamic targets using balloons, sweeping and clearing enemy fortifications using some old sections of wall, breaching and clearing rooms using the old Guard Stables, and so on.

I made it clear that I wasn't concerned with physical discipline - he already had that. I was simply building on it. Along the way, Steelhoof gave me feedback on how the military saddlebags I'd designed had shortcomings, and how equipment could be improved. Step by step, we worked through both von Steuben's manual, and what other materials I had.

Then, two days more repeating all of those same exercises, with the experience gained from the first two. Six days of training and live fire exercise for two.

Then, the seventh day..

DATE: 13 Septimus, 1001 C.S.

K: "Okay, Steelhoof. You and I are going to simulate a two-person assault on an enemy position." I nodded to him.

Steelhoof: "Ahh.. another exercise?" He was game, I could tell - this was FUN, to him.

K: "The last. It ends with the killing of a simulated enemy field commander." I pointed to the pig pen.. there was one missing. "You will take a life, today. That of an animal, yes, but a life none the less." I nodded to him.

Steelhoof: "..ah.." He lowered then raised his head. "I see."

K: "You have to have a taste of what it means. You have to know. That way, if violence does come to us, you will be ready, you will know what it feels like to kill something - not out of hunger or survival, but intentionally." I nodded slowly.

Steelhoof: "I.. understand." He nodded to me.

Together, we loaded up. I determined a standard combat load would be, for now, 50 rounds. One 10-round magazine in the gun, 4 spare. I designed the Sherman with 10-round magazines out of concern for the bulk that a larger magazine would represent for Ponies - Steelhoof proved that 10-rounders might actually be TOO small, and I would have to design a proper 20-rounder.

Once we were loaded, we set out, moving carefully, from position to position, with him in the lead, and me covering him. To be honest, I was learning as much as he was - I had theories, I had knowledge, but I had no chance to put any of that into practice until I actually started working with someone, so I could adjust and adapt.

We came upon the fake Enemy Position, which, for this test, I configured to look like an entrenched area, with some large boulders for cover, and a small area at the back under some netting, representing the HQ. The "enemy commander" was grunting and squealing.

His "soldiers" - a mixture of Watermelons, Cantaloupe, Balloons, and some "puff targets" (tightly bound bags of red chalk dust) - were dispersed through the area. I knew where they were, and while I would simulate giving him cover fire, I would not engage these targets.

K: "Alright.. there's the enemy position. Start when you're ready." I nodded to him.

Steelhoof: "Y.. yes." He steeled himself, then rose to a tactical crouch on two legs, and advanced slowly.. "RIGHT FRONT!" He engaged an enemy Watermelon and decimated it with two rounds.

K: "Targets flanking from the right! Press the advance! COVERING FIRE!" I said, and started randomly shooting at a few trees and bushes.. careful, practiced, fire, challenging myself to hit specific targets.

Steelhoof: "ENGAGING!" He got up, and fired three rounds into a Cantaloupe, blowing it to pieces, before vaulting over the first obstacle. He advanced a bit more, and took a knee. "MOVE UP!"

I let him direct me, and moved over to him, engaging a hanging pinecone of particularly poor disposition while crab-walking, with my laast round, and managed to at least wing it - it fell from the tree, to the ground.

K: "RELOADING!" I called out, taking a knee, and challenging myself to reload as fast as possible. Magazine ejected with an extended finger, new magazine from the pouch with the offhand, and even though the bolt locked back on an empty magazine, I grabbed the bolt handle with my offhand and yanked it all the way back, letting it fly home. "COVERING!" I announced.

Steelhoof: "ADVANCING!" He called out, moving up to cover behind a log, and firing three more times at a pair of balloons, pivoting on one knee, and firing twice at a puff target, making an impressive burst of chalk dust. "RELOADING!"

K: "DOWN!" I pushed him to the ground, simulating incoming fire, and fired three times into a tree knot, scoring two hits near the center, and one along the trunk.

Beneath me, Steelhoof managed to eject his empty mag, fish out a new one, and get it in the magazine well and locked. He grabbed the bolt with his teeth (as intended), and racked it back. He then rolled to the side.

Steelhoof: "TWO MORE!" He engaged a balloon and a watermelon, defeating both hostiles with one round each. "READY TO ADVANCE!"

I got up, and pretended to cover him, firing three times into a stacked pine block inside the entrenchment, hitting it twice, but missing once.

K: "COVERING! GO-GO-GO!" I pushed him a bit.

Steelhoof: "ADVANCING!" He rushed the entrenchment, threw himself over the lip, and came up firing, all eight remaining rounds, into six targets. "RELOADING!"

I got up on the lip of the entrenchment, and fired into the pine block again, twice.

He reloaded again, faster this time, and came up ready.

K: "Entrenchment clear! Go for the Enemy Commander!" I ordered.

He rushed forwards towards the pig.. and I was right behind him. He stopped a moment, having locked eyes with the pig.

I had a feeling he'd falter.

I came up almost next to him.

K: "GUN! WATCH OUT!" I shoved him aside, as my dear Applejack popped up from the side and pegged me square in the ass with an acorn fired from a slingshot. *TH-WHACK!* "MAN DOWN! AHH!" That.. that actually hurt.

Steelhoof was.. VERY into the roleplay. He thought the Pig shot me..

Steelhoof: "NOOO!" He raised his rifle.. and fired three times.

The pig squealed and fell over dead.

Steelhoof moved over to my side, and rolled me over.

Steelhoof: "HUMAN! Ehh.. K! Are you okay!?" He shook me.

Applejack: "Aw, shucks.. that wasn't nothin' but a lil' ol' acorn!" She came out from the far side of the range. "Yew okay, shugah?"

K: "I'm fine." I patted Steelhoof on the shoulder. "Now, do you see?"

Steelhoof: "I.." He blushed. "I thought you'd.. actually been shot." He lowered his head, then raised it to look at Applejack. "Miss Apple.." He nodded to her.

Applejack: "Mah huneybun thought you'd chicken out at th' last second. So.." She shrugged. "..a lil' encouragement."

Steelhoof: "..K, I.. I understand, now." He helped me up.

K: "Good. Warfare isn't for everyone. Neither is killing. But, you're a Guard, and whatever may come? We need you to be ready to kill. To protect those you care about." I patted him on the shoulder.

Steelhoof: "Indeed." He nodded a bit, then safetied his weapon. "I think.. I need to think about this for a few days before I start training the rest of the Guard. You've taught me things I didn't think I needed to know, and now.." He shook his head. "..I have much to consider."

K: "Understandable. Send me a message if you need anything." I safetied my weapon as well, and rested it against the HQ table. "Another shipment of completed Shermans will be here tomorrow. Put them to good use when you're ready." I motioned to Applejack. "Shall we go, my dear?"

With that, Steelhoof was as trained as I could get him in about a week. I could refine the training process even further, now, thanks to his help. He started training the rest of the Guards a couple days later.
