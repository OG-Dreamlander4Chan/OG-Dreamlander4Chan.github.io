	<TD width=1250 colspan=4>Who am I? I'm a very old man. I've been a fan of MLP since I first watched it in 1986. I was enthralled by the early, darker stories of G1. I did like some of the more relatable things from G2 (defined specifically as "My Little Pony Tales"), but G3 (everything after MLP:T to MLP:FiM) just felt like a total cash grab to me. When G4 came around, my wife and I were both IMMEDIATELY sold on it. We watched every episode from Season 1 and 2 together. That was a happy time in my life.<BR>
	<BR>
	I started writing the main story around this time, after a VERY bad bout of flu, and being hopped up on what was likely a slight overdose of NyQuil, Tylenol, and other OTC cold meds caused me to have an INCREDIBLY vivid dream about myself in Equestria. I mean, so vivid, that to this day, I can remember how the air smelled and how.. certain things.. felt. Read the main story and you'll understand.<BR>
	<BR>
	My life took a turn for the worse after a few months, and I was homeless for a bit, more or less, couch-surfing with a few friends. My wife stayed by me. We didn't really get permanent housing until we moved to Oklahoma in 2018. At that point, several years had passed since I was last able to log in to my original DeviantArt account, and I'd lost the passwords. So, I didn't really continue the story until the move. By then, the Series had ended, and I'd missed it. For better or for worse, the Main Story would not be adapted to whatever else had happened in that time.<BR>
	<BR>
	Oh, I did write several others around this time, though! You'll see them in the Stories Page.<BR>
	<BR>
	Around 2022, my life improved agin, when my mother decided to move down to Oklahoma to be with me in her twilight years. I spent almost a full year helping her - and that's a story in itself. By the time she got down here, and bought a house and everything, she was not long for this world, and died soon after. While a sad event, it left me with property, and a chance to do everything for my wife that I'd always wanted to.<BR>
	<BR>
	My wife, "WolfWarrior001," died two weeks later, at the age of 41, after a long battle with a heart virus that attacked the muscles in her heart, and finally, pneumonia. I never got a chance to do the things for and with her, that we always wanted to.<BR>
	<BR>
	The Main Story, though? She was a major contributor. Like me, she'd been a fan since childhood, and loved the G1 "Big Brother" ponies especially - "Tex" was her favorite. She, with few exceptions, was a Real Life, human version of Applejack. She even told me, after I told her about my initial dream, that I'd BETTER wind up with Applejack - as that was as close to her as I could get on four legs.<BR>
	<BR>
	I decided to finish the story in her memory. I am determined to raise effigies to her name wherever I can, for however long I can. She was my soul mate. She was everything to me. I won't find another like her. And let me say, folks, if you EVER find someone like that, spend EVERY MINUTE with them that you can - you never know how many of those minutes you have left.</TD>
