Part 1: Embarking

TIME: 09:00 ERST
DATE: War Day 179/3 Decemus, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Sweet Apple Acres

It had been over a month since Ponyville was attacked.

Almost 15% of the force of 1700 ponies - 253 - died. Celestia didn't blame me. She didn't really know how to handle a mass casualty event like that, though. There was now a newspaper clipping in the barn by my cot - it's a photo of Celestia visiting the MEDIVAC'ed wounded that were sent to Canterlot Royal Hospital - it was the largest in Equestria, and had enough bed space to handle the casualties.

The headline is "PRINCESS VISITS WAR WOUNDED" - you can see my boot in the upper-left of the image. The reason I saved it, was because of her face. The look of despair she had, at seeing all those young ponies, lying injured, because of an enemy we didn't fully understand. It was a reminder to me - not to make mistakes, and to try everthing I could to prevent another massive blood bath like that again.

It's not to say we failed at Large Force Tactics (as we fielded almost 5 Regiments) - we actually did very well, considering we were facing an opponent that didn't react to bullets like normal creatures did. If it had been an equal force of Raptorians instead, well.. I guessed our casualty rate would have been less. One in five, perhaps. Or one in six, if we got lucky. Raptorians armed with firearms, even - they react to bullets the same way any other living creature does, and they are precisely what the Army is trained to fight, so, that in mind, we would have done much better.

What shocked me was how quickly the losses were replaced. By War Day 150, 700 new recruits signed up for military service in the Royal Army, Marines, Air Force or Navy, another 400 signed up for Government service in non-military roles like nursing, logistics, manufacturing and so on - from all across the kingdom. Ponyville replaced its Militia losses in a week. Bell Perrin was promoted to command 3rd Company, having been Noteworthy's XO before that.

But, in the intervening month, other things came to mind. For one thing, Norfy tried to design me an integrated helmet. It was great! But it weighed a ton. It would have kept my precious bean pot completely protected from small arms fire, AND given me on-the-spot radio access. But the batteries for the radio, and the radio unit itself, inflated the size of the helmet.. that and it was vaguely shaped on the outside like a horse head - honestly, I thought that looked cool.

It was hanging on one of my racks, right now. I had the ear piece and mouth piece pulled out so I could use the Radio part without having to put it on.

It's not his fault - the technology for circuitry simply wasn't advanced enough to make a tactical helmet like that. Oh, well.

Next was new weapons. The 6.5mm ammo I'd been working on, hadn't really advanced any, but I went ahead with the issuance of the new Patton assault rifle to 1st Battalion of the Royal Army, and I had some extras sent to some Ranger units for testing and evaluation. I figured, the design is sound, I can just issue new ammo later. By War Day 200, I should have enough Pattons to arm the entire re-formed 1st Royal Army Battalion and all the priority units - Paratroopers, Rangers, and Marines.

That and I took about two weeks off to look after Starlight Mint some. It was.. touching and almost painful to the heart that she treated Luna and I like we were her parents. Two weeks at the palace, looking after her, my little born Ranger. One night, she had a horrible nightmare of her parents being killed, and came and curled up with me. Not because she was scared, but because she wanted to protect me from those nightmares.

Oh, well - if I'm going to have a life in Equestria, I may as well have a family as well. And Starlight was the best 'daughter' anyone could ask for.

Today, though, was the beginning of a change. I was taking some ponies with me, out on an expedition. We'd be hitting all the classics - Hydia's tower, Dream Castle, and anything else we could come up with.

We needed information. Badly. Those places should have it.

Coming with me, of course, were the Girls - they refused to be left out of this - as well as six Rangers. The problem was picking the Rangers.. well, actually, the problem was more, who do I pick from all the volunteers? I decided on Sunshine Smiles, Nurse Redheart, Octavia, Vy, Lyra and Ambrosia. Doctor Allcome was going to come with as well - he had an interest in archaeology. More of a hobby, but I trusted his judgement. Lyra had a long-standing interest in ancient things, and the most impressive collection of tomes dedicated to the subject.

At the moment, we were getting everythng together. We started preparing at 08:00, right after breakfast.

Applejack: "Now, Mac, you make sure Apple Bloom does her homework every afternoon after school. And GITS ta school every mornin', y'hear?" She wagged her hoof at him.

Mac: "Eeyup." He nodded.

Applejack: "And y'all make sure you get them new saplin's in th' ground b'fore th' end of th' month, y'hear?" She nodded to the Orchards.

Mac: "Eeyup." He, again, nodded.

Applejack: "And make sure Granny ain't th' only one doin' th' dishes after dinner!" She leaned into him.

Mac: "Eeyup." He, once more, nodded.

Applejack: "And help Cheerilee with the Rangers, too!" She puffed up a bit.

Mac: "Eeyup." He, once again, just nodded.

K: "..does she do this every time she takes a trip, or something?" I nodded to Mac.

Mac: *Chuckle* "Eeeyup!" He leaned against the barn door, smiling and shaking his head at Applejack as she packed her saddle bags.

Applejack: "Hm.. Sagebrush.. Chaffee.. Patton.. or Knox?" She considered her four weapons - all of them had her cutie mark on the stock.

K: "Rarity's taking a Scoped Sherman, Fluttershy and Dash are taking Mitchells, Pinkie's taking a Knox already, and Twilight's taking a Patton." I shrugged. "And so am I. So, Chaffee."

Applejack: "Mmm.. yeah, but 'm faster with the Sagebrush." She shrugged.

K: "Sagebrush then. And you can wear your chaps and trench coat with your uniform shirt." I pointed to her.

Applejack: "See, now ah c'n respect a man that knows how'ta accessorize!" She happily loaded up her Sagebrush Shotgun and her brace of two Custer Revolvers into her saddlebags.

Rarity had taken a liking to a special long-barrel Custer I'd made her. I carved the grips myself, burning her Cutie Mark into both sides, and her name stenciled along the back of the grip.

My Patton had one of Rarity's scopes on it. Same model used on the Scoped Shermans, actually, I made sure the mounting points were identical. Good shots under 300 meters, though all the ammo we were making was of such low velocity at this point, there were issues with it arcing. Still, the full production gem scopes had magic in them - THIS was one advantage the real world didn't have. Our Scopes could act like close range red dot sights, or adjust themselves to act like magnified sights, automatically adjusting for range and bullet drop - but the drawback was, you needed to be adept at magic to make them perform to their fullest, thus, Unicorns made better snipers. The one Rarity made for me, was pretty much close range only since I had no magic what so ever.

I packed olive drabs for this. All of them, made by Rarity. OD cargo pants, OD shirt, the works, with a field jacket AND my trench coat (the tan one), just in case. And a hat. Rarity made me something resembling a baseball cap to wear. Resembling. Her grasp of human styles wasn't perfect, yet, so the baseball cap came out with an elongated front end, like a peaked cap.

Once we got packed, Applejack and I made our way to the assembly area - town square. Everyone was arriving there, and several people came to see us off. Derpy was among them. She looked so upset that she couldn't join us..

Derpy: "Applejack! You take care of my General, you hear me?" She nodded, with a bit of a pout to her face.

Applejack: "Yer General, mah Stallion." She smirked back at her.

Dr. Allcome: "Well, I'm packed and ready." He looked at Applejack and myself, nodding a little. "This should be an interesting expedition."

K: "I'm not even sure where we're going. Hydia's, yes, after Dream Castle, but after that, I have no idea. It'll depend on where the intelligence takes us." I shrugged.

The good Doctor elected to carry a Mark I Sherman, but without a scope. Seems he prefers Irons. There was a Lee on his hip.

Sunshine Smiles arrived next. He was dressed almost like a hobo - but I could tell the difference between "Hobo" and "Operator." All the clothes were comfortable, easy to move in, loose without being baggy, and easily removed or added should the weather change. This was a pony that knew his shit.

Sunshine: "General. You put me in charge of the Ranger squad..?" He asked, setting his saddle bags down.

Sunshine was lugging a scoped Patton and a Lee. Standard Ranger weapons. He also had a machete-like implement - well, for me, it would be closer to a large knife than a machete, but he's a pony, not a human.

K: "That I did, and I can see I made the right choice. Let me guess.. your family actually hunted, camped and fished?" I shrugged.

Sunshine Smile: "My mother did. It's how she kept us fed.." He seemed a little put off on discussing this, so I dropped the subject.

Next to arrive was Lyra - trailed by Gaze and Bon-Bon.

Lyra: "Ahm ginn'ae be fein, I sez!" She was arguing with Gaze about her safety.

Gaze: "OH! General!" He trotted up to me. "Goot' to see you."

Bon-Bon: "Yes, but you know how I worry.." She fussed over Lyra's uniform.

K: "Gaze. Looking good. How's the rib?" When Gorosbif had stabbed him, he'd managed to break a rib and nearly collapse Gaze's lung.

Gaze: "Aye, it's fine. Still hurts to cough, some." He frowned.

Dr. Allcome: "It's nothing to worry about. It was a very bad break. Just stay off normal duty for another month, and you should be fully recovered." He shrugged.

Gaze: "Reight, reight.." He shrugged. "..be careful, K. I werry 'boot'cha.." And, he looked at Lyra.

K: "Oh, Gaze. Don't worry. I'll make sure Lyra makes it back." I gave him a hug.

Lyra: "Ahm ready t'go." She presented herself in uniform - beret turned with the red side in - sporting a Scoped Sherman and her Lee.

K: "Good. We'll leave once everyone gets here."

Nurse Redheart arrived next, with, of all people, Forest Spirit. He still had a patch over his injured eye. I watched them from a distance - he nuzzled her neck, she blushed, then came over and joined us. Forest Spirit declined to make his presence known publicly - I understood, to an extent. A scarred warrior in a land of perfect ponies. Redheart was carrying a Zhukov, her saddle bags loaded with medical supplies to back up Dr. Allcome.

Ambrosia pulled up next. Casual dress - cargo chaps, a blue-and-yellow checkered shirt, green vest, and her construction helmet with camo paint on it. She came over without much fuss, and started talking to Applejack right away. She was carrying a Chaffee and her Lee.

Last to arrive was Octavia and Scratch. They came waltzing in, talking with each other. Both were carrying scoped Pattons. Octavia was a good shot, but Scratch was one hell of a sniper. The girls would be arriving soon, we'd meet them at Militia Headquarters. And once they did, we'd be on our way. Hydia's castle was going to be our second stop - Dream Castle was much closer, and 2nd Battalion had an entire company in place, to hold it, just in case Trixie came back and decided she wanted a piece of it.

I wondered what we'd find?


TIME: 10:00 ERST
LOCATION: Ponyville Militia Headquarters

We were all sitting around piles of old maps - everything that anyone could find regarding the Gloom Mountain Region and the Everfree Forest. Harv brought us all tea and a snack. Watercress sandwich for me, with greens and a shot of mustard. I was getting more vegetables in my diet than I ever did before, and I was getting used to it. Perhaps the world was changing me, as much as I was changing it.

Sunshine Smiles: "..see, I've been to the forests south of Ponyville a few times. Before the military, I mean." He shrugged. "My mother used to tell me stories of some ruins out there, and at first, I thought it was Dream Castle. Now, I know different."

K: "Really? Well.." I scratched my chin. "..maybe it has something to do with the Rainbow of Light."

Twilight: "That's our ultimate goal?" She looked to me.

K: "Ultimately. Apparently, we need it to defeat Tirek." I shrugged. "If that's the case, then we need to be extra careful. Trixie was talking about how the Castle wasn't what they were looking for, so, it's entirely possible the enemy has forces in the area - small bands - looking for the same clues we are."

Fluttershy: "I hope we find it. I've heard stories about the Rainbow.. it's supposed to be beautiful!" She squee'd a little at the thought.

K: "If we find it, great. If not, we need military intelligence. Anything we can get on Tirek's operation - let's not forget, we have a factory facility to find, too." I reminded them.

Rarity: "Of course. The navy IS out looking, but there are so many islands to check." She shrugged.

K: "Exactly. Now, then, any questions?"

Pinkie: "OOH! OOH! Are there going to be any cakes!?" She beamed, bouncing in the back.

K: "..why would you ask that, Pinkie?" I blinked.

Pinkie: "Because I see a dessert on the map!" She pointed at the desert far out west, by the mountains.

K: "That's a desert, Pinkie, not dessert." I smirked. I knew she was joking. "Alright, final equipment check, then we head out."

I went over the things in my backpack, making sure I had everything I needed, as I finished my sandwich. I saw Scoots and Harv back by the house.. Scoots, of course, was worried about us. I gave her a reassuring grin, and that seemed to satisfy her. I wondered, though - with our track record of the worst possible things going on at the worst times, what sort of crap was waiting for us in Dream Castle? Was it going to be another Acid Monster? Hidden pitfalls? Stuff Trixie left behind? Or that Grogar did?

We'd have to wait and see.

{End of Part 1}

Part 2: Castle Investigation

TIME: 13:00 ERST
DATE: War Day 179
LOCATION: Ruins of Dream Castle

The ponies of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Regiment, 15th Infantry Company were well dispersed around the ruins. We packed light for this first leg of the trip - I figured we might be here for three days, and the Army troops here would have food and water. Just the same, I made sure everyone brought at least some food with them, just in case we got stuck in the basements or something.

Rations were one thing we didn't really bother to develop. Ponies were like the damned VietCong - the VC could live off a smattering of rice and a few fish heads for a couple weeks. Ponies? Oats. Dried oats. And in an emergency, grass. Everyone had a canister of oats on them, along with some other things. I know Applejack had a bunch of dried apples, and I think Rarity was packing some cranberries and nuts. Pinkie.. shockingly.. had a rather low-key yoghurt-coated trail mix. Ambrosia had some "hard muffins" - something she used to pack when she worked construction.

I was the only one that needed anything seriosuly well-rounded for sustained operations. I could make do with vegetarian - nuts helped - though AJ had packed me some smoked turkey jerky. I had dried rice and beans in addition to that. Really, I wasn't that concerned. Having been rather dirt-eating poor at one stage of my life, I was used to making do with very little, if necessary. The only thing I really "needed" (now that I had access to it) was coffee. I had a quarter pound of it, and a coffee pot.

Applejack: "So, what're we gonna do in the castle, K?" She asked as she hopped over the remains of part of the wall.

K: "Look around. There must be clues somewhere. Anything. Trixie left in a big hurry, so, there's no telling what she left behind. Or what the Jewel Wizard was originally after, besides that ceremony he was trying to do." I followed, carefully covering her as I did.

Twilight: "Should we split up?" She asked, as we entered what used to be the main courtyard.

K: "Well, of course. One of you girls pick someone else." I pointed.

Twilight (and Spike) went with Ambrosia, Pinkie went with Lyra, Rarity went with Octavia, Dash went with Scratch, Fluttershy went with Nurse Redheart, and AJ and I went together. Dr. Allcome ended up with Sunshine. We each picked different areas of the ruins to check for clues. Applejack and I ended up in the basement. Not the same area where Norfy went Sub-Zero on Bray, but a different section.

Applejack: "Y'know, I never asked.." She trailed off.

K: "What's that?" I responded, shifting the nine pound stamped steel assault rifle on my shoulder.

Applejack: "Do they have.. uh.. nawty magazines in yer world?" She blushed a little.

K: "Odd question, but, yes. They have up-scale ones like Playboy and its slightly more demented cousin Penthouse, then they have just plain nudie and graphic sex ones that only exist to get you aroused." I said, as we reached our area.

The area we were inspecting had multiple rooms attached to a main hallway. I certainly didn't remember this from Generation 1, though, as I was learning, not everything is as it seems in Equestria - my memories were merely guideposts, the details often differed significantly.

Applejack: "See, ah thought so.." she started, rifling through a pile of wooden crates. "..you read many of 'em?"

K: "No, actually. I used to get my jollies on the internet. Any unusual sex act that I wanted to see - legal ones - were but a few keystrokes away. All free. Any reason you're asking about my self-service habits, honey?" I asked as I went through.. well, it might've been a book shelf at one time.

Applejack: "Oh, no reason. Jes' came t'mind since I caught Big Mac lookin' at one a few weeks ago. Been meanin' to ask ya' - I mean, you don't exactly sit down and tell those kind'a stories about Earth that often." She said, shoving some of the boxes to the center of the room, getting them out of the way.

K: "You're right, you know? Besides some basic history and stuff that I told Twilight, I really haven't said much about Earth customs, have I? I guess I've been too busy to really think about it." I realized that.. and that I'd really been too focused on the war or the defense of the kingdom to really stop and think much outside of my job. "Is that typical?"

Applejack: "Iz whut typ-a-cul?" She asked, her mouth full of old rags that she was setting aside, in case they were important.

K: "Not really having time to think - just, you know, doing your job." I shrugged. "Come to think of it, I really haven't had much time to sit down and think of anything besides the war... or you." And Luna, but that was different.

Applejack: "Aww.. flirtin' at a time like this?" She smirked, but she was blushing.

K: "If we didn't have a war to fight, I'd probably be helping out at the farm, or making pizza all day, and coming home, sleeping with you, getting up, and repeating the act." I shrugged, finding a few pieces of paper with writing on them I couldn't decipher. I set that aside. "There.. really, you guys don't have a lot of liesure time, do you? I mean, you're always finding something to do. Some zany adventure."

Applejack: "Y'know, yer right? I never stopped to think about that." She made a *hm!* sound as she continued going through the boxes.

K: "I think that's something else.. on Earth, we have automation to such a high degree, there's all kinds of liesure time to be had. Here, the labor is almost totally manual, and even when there's no work to be done, there's always something else to do. You don't have time to.. contemplate your navel." I shrugged. "That's an old Earth term for sitting around and just thinking for the sake of thinking."

Applejack: "Wuz 'bout to say.." She pulled a torch stick off the wall, and examined it. Some kind of specially treated wood.

K: "Maybe that's why things get ignored..?" I was thinking about Scoots. How could I not? Such a sweet kid - er, pony - and no one realised she was all alone. "You're all too busy.. to notice." I stopped. "Applejack.. what if that's part of it?" I turned to her.

She had some old clothes she was sizing over herself - checking to see if any of them looked good on her. She hid them as soon as I turned to face her.

Applejack: "Whut ya mean, Honeybun?" She gave an embarrassed grin.

K: "Celestia.. remember? How she had that whole tyrant thing going, banished Luna.. all of it.." I ignored her fashion show.

Applejack: "Yeah..?" She tilted her head, and let the clothes drop out of sight behind her.

K: "Well, she never did go into detail about how she forced peace on the land. What if part of it, was making sure ponies were constantly distracted? So the little problems would be ignored? And big ones, she'd handle herself?" I trailed off. It sounded crazy.

Applejack: "You mean, like a spell..?" She tilted her head. My paranoia had gotten to her, I could see it in her eyes. "Somethin' like.. mass hypnosis?"

K: "Maybe. Maybe something as simple as a Spell of Carefree? You know, that ponies would not care about their lot in life and just accept who they are with a smile, or.. some kind of happiness threshhold?" I shrugged. "It sounds crazy-"

Applejack: "Muh parents." She lowered her head. "I just thought about it.. after.. th' accident.. 'n we buried 'em.. I wuz back to doin' my thing in a few days. Heck, ah didn't even think 'bout 'em when I went to Manehattan!" She lifted her head. "I.."

K: "Something we need to talk to her about." I frowned. "What DID happen to them, honey?"

Applejack: "Uh.." She swallowed hard. "..ah put it outta my mind, I guess.." She was tearing up.

I went over and hugged her.

K: "Tell me."

Applejack: "It was.. raht after Apple Bloom was born.. raht after a big storm.. they were out at the back buildin'.. Ma was gettin' some apples from th' feed silo fer th' pigs.. Pa was.." She shook her head. "It's so.. foggy.. lahk.."

K: "You can remember. Scoots remembered how her mother died." Though, it came to mind, did this world 'wash away' bad memories after a certain time?

Applejack: "It was Zap Apple Harvest Day.. I r'member that.." She lowered her head into my shoulder. "It's no good.. every time I try to.." *AH* At the short scream, she squeezed me tightly. "Blood.. so much blood.." She started sobbing. "..an' Timberwolves.. an'.. an' I was out in th' forest, an'.. an'.." She was shaking, holding on to me so tightly, I swore she was going to break a rib. "..it't'was all my fault.."

Applejack finally let go of me, and slunk to the floor. Tears poured from her eyes like rivers. She started slamming her hoof against the ground. Hard.

Applejack: "Stuipd.. stupid.. stupid.." She whirled around and punched the wall, hard enough to crack it. "STUPID!" She turned to face me. "THAT'S WHY AH LEFT PONYVILLE! IT'S MAH FAULT MA AND PA ARE DEAD!!" She wobbled and fell over on her side, curling up, and crying.

All I could do, was curl up by her, and hold her, and gently stroke her mane.

Applejack: "Ah didn't deserve th' farm! Ah wuzun't cut out fer apple buckin'! AH KILL'T MAH PARENTS!" She started rubbing her face with her hooves. Hard. I had to hold them to keep her from hurting herself. "MAH FAULT! MAH FAULT!" She said, over and over.

K: "Calm down, honey.. I know, it's hard.." I stroked her neck, one arm barely able to hold her forelegs away from her face.

Applejack: "Ah went to th' woods.. ah wuz so dumb, they'd done told me NOT to.." She quivered in my grasp. "..ah got attacked bah Timberwolves.. they'd tree'd me.." She stammered. "Ah-ah.. Ma.. she.. she heard me cryin'.. she come'd runnin'.. they.. she shrieked.. an'.. then they got Pa, when he come ta help Ma.." She was hiccuping now, from all the crying. "..an' they.. ate 'em.." She held her eyes closed. "Granny came runnin' with the pots.. she chased 'em off.. but.."

K: "That explains what happened to your folks." I said, still holding her. "And why you left. You felt guilty. But something kept you from remembering why. So you wanted to find what you thought would be your rightful place in the world. So, you went to Manehattan.. but then.."

Applejack: "Dash happened." She reminded me.

K: "Right. And that, for whatever reason, showed you that society wasn't for you, either. So you came home." I pet her mane.

Applejack: "Yeah.." She squirmed in my grasp so she was facing me. "Thank ya.. naw, I mean it." She hugged on me again. A warm, loving hug. But, after a moment... "Y'know, I can't remember anyone else ever talkin' about painful stuff like this. Ever." She lifted her head, her eyes gazing into mine. "Part'a me sez this here's real special.." She said softly. "Feels like mah heart's.. jes' wellin' up with emotion.."

We stayed there like that for a bit longer, before we finally got up again.

K: "Feel better, honey?" I asked, softly.

Applejack: "Like.. some kinda'a weight's been lifted off'a me." She shrugged. "Like, a weight ah didn't know ah had." She smiled. "How'd a lil' hayseed lahk me, ever git with a fine monkey stallion lahk you?" She smirked.

K: "Just lucky, I guess." I shrugged, as I set back to my work. I went for one of the doors, opening, it, looking at her with a grin as I did...

..I didn't see what was behind the door.

Applejack: *Quivering fear* "H-Honeybu-un?!"

K: "Yes, my dear?" I asked, hand on my hip.

I saw her reach for her Sagebrush shotgun...

Applejack: "GET DAYOWN!"

*Shotgun fire*

I managed to duck right as she pulled the trigger. I could still feel the whoosh of shot flying over my head, though. It hit whatever was behind me, I was close enough that I could hear the pellets hit the flesh of whatever it was. I dove forwards, letting myself sprawl out on the ground. Freeing my Patton Assault Rifle from the shoulder strap, I rolled back around to look at what she'd just done.

A Raptorian - a very dead one. No, no, I mean it was dead before she shot it. And it had.. HAD been moving.

K: "ZOMBIE RAPTORIANS!" I shouted. The doors started opening all at once, I could hear Applejack reloading her shotgun as I got up. "Ah, shit.."

Zombie Raptorians. Nothing like the revenants that Hydia had plagued us with, no, this was more crass... more.. plebian. Amateurish, almost. Like Grogar wasn't half the necromancer that Hydia was. Then again, Hydia was a Lich, not mortal, and exceedingly old. And she had Necrooze backing her up, increasing her power.

K: "I gotta test something." I said, sighting in on a Raptorian that looked like it had been shot a few times already (likely what killed it).

I flipped my Fire Selector to full automatic, and let loose with a string of five rounds. They went right where I aimed them, stitching across his chest. Green blood poured out.. GREEN blood. Darker than the Necrooze. I watched it fall over, and tapped Applejack on the shoulder.

K: "Fall back to the stairs." I instructed as I sighted in on another one. Another five rounds was fired, and that one fell dead, too. "They're dead, but not THAT dead!"

Applejack: "Got yer six, honeybun!" She fired her Sagebrush into a Raptorian's face.

Whatever animated these things, it left them in a state truly between life and death. Their bodies were killable just like a mortal, but they were dead on the inside. Husks of whatever they once were. They advanced on us, slowly..

K: "Right.. and the bird brain.."

I sighted on a head as best I could and tapped the trigger, firing a single round. No brain, no zombie. Not bad. We fell back towards the stairs, and as soon as I got to them, I could hear more shooting. It seemed we triggered whatever trap was here, and let loose who-knows-how-many undead. Once we got to the stairs, Applejack held the rear while I took the front.

Applejack: "Well, at least this ain't like Treants!" She said - I heard her shotgun bark loudly. Another kill, most likely.

K: "At least these are polite enough to DIE on command.." I said, firing the last four rounds in my magazine into two close-together Zombie Raptorians.

I reloaded, tilting my way around the corner.

K: "We need to meet up with the others and get the buck outt'a here!" I leaned into the rifle and fired five rounds into a target. It fell nice and dead.

Applejack: "Right!"

K: "Library's closest." I nodded. "Come on."

The zombies weren't coming from everywhere - thankfully - but they were pretty dense in the areas they WERE in. We arrived at what remained of the Library, just in time to see a Zombie Raptorian blown through the door.

K: "BLUE! BLUE! CHECK YOUR FIRE!" I called in.

Ambrosia: "Well, get the BUCK in here, then!" I could hear her reloading her Chaffee.

We dashed inside, and I caught Spike as he was reloading his Lee.

K: "Situation?" I up-nodded to them.

Twilight: "They came from that bookshelf stack over there. Just.. all of a sudden, they were everywhere!" She waved her arms.

Spike: "MORE!" He pointed.

K: "Twilight, can you teleport yourself and Spike out to the courtyard?" I leaned in to her.

Twilight: "Uhm.. myself, yes, maybe.." She nodded.

K: "Do it! We need reinforcements! Tell the Officer in Charge to sweep and clear the ruins." I nodded. "I'll look after Spike."

Spike: "Hey! I'm fine a-" He whipped around, looking at Twilight. "T-T-Twiiiliiiight!"

K: "GO!"

*Magic Poof*

*Machine Gunfire*

The second she dematerialized, I had to fire. A zombified Raptorian with two heads (really?) had been about to grab her. Ten rounds. I reloaded again, now working with my 30-round magazines.

K: "Ambrosia! Point! We're pushing towards the Living Quarters!" I nodded.

Ambrosia: "BUCKIN' ZOMBIES!" *Shotgun fire* "GOTCHA, K!" Under the crushing fire of her Chaffee, we advanced.

Applejack: "Ah hope Pinkie's okay..." She said, with a note of fear.

K: "Her? No. She's fine. It's the zombies I'm more worried about. These poor souls need to be put down.." *Gunfire* "..with kindness!" *Gunfire* "With understanding!" *Gunfire.* I relaoded. "And most of all!" One grabbed me, only for me to kick it in the hip, and repeatedly shank it with the sword. "COMPASSION!" I decapitated it. "Pinkie will torture the poor things."

Ambrosia: "..oh, really?" *Snerk*

She ejected the Chaffee magazine into the face of the next Zombie Raptorian, and after reloading a new tube, fired into its skull without looking. We made it to the Living Quarters... and the place was plastered with party streamers and balloons.

K: "See!? Torture!" I feigned shock.

There were several zombies already bound up in Party Streamers. A single shot in each head.

K: "BLUE!" I called out. "BLUE! LYRA?! PINKIE! WHERE ARE YOU!?"

Lyra: *Distant* "Back hea'h!"

Moving around to the back of the Living Quarters, we passed through masses of dead.. well, zombies. Tied up in party streamers, splattered on the wall.. a pile of them decapitated with what looked like expert blade work.. headshots, headshots everywhere.. it was a mess. I didn't see any moving ones.

K: "Coming back there! Check your fire!" I called out.

Pinkie: "Oh, it's okay!" She was hanging from the ceiling, next to me. "We're okay here! Really!"

Looking up, I could see she was suspended by a party streamer that was embedded into the ceiling, through cracks in the stone. She had a knife in one hand, her Lee in the other.

Applejack: "Git dayown frum thar!" She snorted.

K: "You okay, Lyra?" I called back.

Lyra: "Jest fein!" She came trotting out, her bayonet fixed to her scoped Sherman, and a bloodied mess.

Spike: "What happened here?" He looked around, amazed.

Pinkie: "We handled the meanie-butts!" She plopped down, and gave Spike a hug. "See? Nothing to fear!"

Lyra: "She laughed at 'em.."

Pinkie: "A little Party.."

Lyra: "..an' made jokes at 'em.."

Pinkie: "..some party favors.."

Lyra: "..an' humiliated 'em.."

Pinkie: "..and a whole lot of laughter!"

Lyra: "She used a cannon! Whar'd she git th' cannon!?"

Pinkie: "Right here!" She whipped out her Party Cannon, aimed it at the wall, and.. "BREACHING!"

*KABOOOOOM*

She knocked a hole clean through it. Though, as if by magic (imagine that), the hole she opened allowed Fluttershy and Nurse Redheart to stumble through, walking backwards, firing at more zombies.

K: "GET TO COVER! FLUTTERSHY! REDHEART! BACK THIS WAY!" I called, taking a knee behind a destroyed wall.

Fluttershy: "Right!" *Whine!* "They're everywhere!" She said, freaking a little, but holding it together as she and Nurse Redheart got to cover near Ambrosia.

K: "LIGHT 'EM UP!"

We fired into the hole, which opened into a hallway - fantastic choke point - and gunned down zombie after zombie. Brass spraying all over the floors as we picked headshots or sprayed a few rounds into multiple targets. Ambrosia and Applejack wasted them in twos and threes if any of them got too close, while the rest of us got the ones farther up the hall. Soon, the hall was choked with corpses. Then, it was nearly filled.. a stack of undead almost five feet high, in a hallway that was just over six foot.

K: "Alright, cease fire. Ammo count." I checked my stock.

Ambrosia: "Three mags, full on pistol."

Nurse Redheart: "Four magazines. But if you give me a minute, I can load my pistol magazines into my empties."

K: "Do it." That there is ONE advantage of sharing calibers between your primary and secondary.

Pinkie: "Uhm.. twenty three big boom grenades, fifteen shrapnel, a dozen fire, a dozen flash, six smoke, and twenty party grenades. Oh, and five pistol magazines." She said, looking through her saddlebags.

Applejack: "Twenty-eight shells. Full on pistol."

Spike: "Five magazines. I've been saving my empties!"

K: "Good, Spike."

Fluttershy: "Four magazines.. uh.. did I do okay?"

Lyra: "Eight." She handed Fluttershy two of hers. "Make it six fer each'a us." And there's an advantage of sharing calibers and magazines across forces.

I decided I was going to have to make a better 6.5mm round... if I could just get better powder and better velocity...

K: "Alright, we need to get to the kitchens. Dash and Scratch are there. It's the closest. Then, the Ballroom Area where you fought Nightmare Moon. Rarity and Octavia ought to be there. The front area, we shouldn't have to worry about. Dr. Allcome and Sunshine should be picked up by Twilight and the reinforcements I asked her to get."

It still tickled me pink that Octavia had been so dedicated to her job, that she'd risked so much for her friends, even after being so severely wounded that no one thought she'd be Ranger material ever again, that she'd come along. Even if they weren't her bestest-best friends, like the girls were.

K: "Let's move. Applejack, you and Ambrosia up front. Ambrosia, once you're down to your last tube, fall back behind me. Save that last tube for an emergency." I nodded to her.

Ambrosia: "Yeah, gotcha." She frowned.

We stacked up and advacned up the hall we'd just come from. Kitchens were to the left. We got to them, and found the Kitchens quiet..

K: "Dash! Scratch! You're both okay." I nodded.

Dash: "Yeah, why wouldn't we be?"

Scratch: "Something wrong, K?"

Spike: "There's Z-Z-Zombies everywhere!" He stammered, looking around.

Scratch gave him a silly look, lowering her shades.

K: "No, he's serious. There really are zombies all over the place. Now, on us, let's move, you two in the rear. We're about halfway through our ammo here." I shrugged.

No time to waste - and I didn't want to give whatever was in the Kitchen, time to get at us - we moved up in file towards the main Ballroom area. Breaching the doors, Applejack and Ambrosia moved into the room's corners, while Pinkie and I moved up along side them.

Ambrosia: "Clear."

K: "Clear."

Applejack: "Clear."

Pinkie: "Clear as a bell!"

K: "Rarity! Octavia!"

Rarity: "Up here, K!"

She and Octavia were both grasping for dear life on to a large tapestry. The bottom part of it was shredded. I could see their primary weapons on the ground, not far from where they were.

Octavia: "Watch out! It's still around here!" She warned us as she moved herself around to help Rarity hang on better.

K: "What is?" I said, moving over and retrieving their weapons.

I felt the presence behind me, off towards the back hallway that led towards the other basement area - the one we'd fought Trixie, Brey and Grogar in.

I spun, a Patton in each hand, but saw nothing.

K: "Eyes and ears, people. something's out here, I can feel it." I motioned for Ambrosia. "Ambrosia, Dash, Fluttershy, help them get down. Pinkie, Applejack, Lyra, get to covering positions. Spike, Redhart, Scratch cover the door we just came in."

The ponies moved to their jobs. I sort of stood there, in the middle of the room - I didn't say it, but I was bait. I had Octavia's Patton in one hand, my own in the other, and I was constantly rotating around the shadow-filled room. Despite it being daytime, the roof and walls blown out from the bombing run back during Royal Oak, and the shattered windows, only one part of the room caught any light at all.

My eyes twitched around.. that primal human instinct of knowing something is there, something predatory, and something that CAN kill you, easily.. it was punching my Fight-or-Flight response in the nuts. I wanted to run, just from the feeling this thing was putting off.. but I couldn't. I wouldn't. I swallowed hard, waiting... casting glances as Dash and Fluttershy helped Rarity, then Octavia down.. once they were on the ground, I tossed Octavia her weapon, and one-hand unslung Rarity's rifle and passed it to her, walking a bit closer to them.

Applejack: "Nothin's comin' out.." She said, hopefully.

K: "It's here. I can feel it." I said, an edge of pure terror in my voice, despite my attempts to hold it in. "We humans have a very strong survival instinct. We just KNOW when there's a predator out there, tougher than us, that can EAT us.. it's how we stayed alive long enough to evolve.." I trailed off. "Okay, we rescued our people. Everyone fall back, slowly.. weapons ready. Fire only if you have a confirmed target."

We started backing off. Slow. Careful. Making for the door. I was NOT going to stay in that room..

Twilight: *Up the hall* "K!"

K: "In here!" I called, not daring to turn my back to look towards where her voice was coming from. "Alright, cover positions, left of the door, in the light patch." I pointed.

*Groaning gurgle*

K: "...fuck." I couldn't pinpoint the sound. "TWILIGHT! HURRY UP!" I yelled. I could hear her and the reinforcements dealing with zombies.

When it stepped out of the shadows, I was about to drop a ten-ton brick in my pants. It was ten feet tall, had four arms, six legs, and a mutated horse-like face. It was some kind of undead construct.. to me, it looked like a zombified Slepnir.. the horse of Odin.

K: *Croak* "Open fire!" I was barely able to squeak it out.

Part 4: Festival of Servants

TIME: 13:44 ERST
DATE: War Day 179
LOCATION: Main hall/Ballroom, Dream Castle
SITUATION: Brix are being shat, NOPE is being had, and IT'S HAPPENING

The average pony is a bit under five foot, from my perspective, on her hind legs (four foot, eight to ten inches, or thereabouts - 142-147cm). Celestia is right about my height (six foot, two inches - about 185-188cm). Luna, a bit less so (about five foot, eight inches - 172cm). This.. Zombie Slepnir was easily over ten feet on all fours (over three meters). It wore armor over its chest, flanks, back, and forelegs. It had a helmet as well, with a unicorn-like horn on it. Oh, and it looked very sharp.

Did I mention the ten limbs? I think I forgot that part.

Its mouth was covered in broken, razor-sharp teeth. Its skin pulled taut over its muscles and bones. The skin was pallid, the color of diseased flesh. And it wanted us dead.

It scared me. Somewhere deep in my primal human instincts, it stirred a special kind of fear. Terror. Horror. I was fighting to move properly. I'd ordered the others to open fire on the creature, but I had no idea if bullets would even work. I hip-fired into the beast, letting the entire 30-round magazine run dry as it staggered into the center of the room.

Blood. BLACK blood. It oozed from the wounds. I could see it.

We could hurt it.

K: "SCATTER!" I screamed, forcing my legs to pump across the large room as I fumbled to reload.

Gone was the confident General of Equestria's Armed Forces. I was just a lowly human with a stick that went boom.

But, I called it. the unicorn horn of the helmet fired a beam - purple, I noted, in my near-panic - that impacted just above where Rarity had been a moment before. Her marshmallow-fluffy hide rolled across the ground with the grace of a ballerina, and she came up firing.

I hid behind a broken pillar.

K: "PINKIE! GRENADE THAT THING!" I screamed as I struggled to get the magazine in the magazine well, my hands shaking uncontrollably.

Pinkie: *HA-HA!*

*Grenade 'bloop'*

*Firecracker noise*

Oh, great, she used a Party Grenade.

I forced myself from behind concealment, just as the Slepnir took a swing at Ambrosia. Ambrosia ducked the first leg, and jumped on the second. She back-flipped off of it, and fired her shotgun in its leg joint.

I got the magazine in, and ran the charging handle. Shouldering the Patton, I fired at its face, hoping to poke out an eye. All I managed to do was dent the armor.

Its head turned to face me. A purple beam emitted from its horn, and all I could do was flatten myself against the ground, and roll, roll, roll away from there. I felt the handle of my sword jab me in the side, but I ignored it.

Applejack: "IT AIN'T HURTIN' MUCH!" I could hear her yell, as her Sagebrush fired.

No kidding. I didn't think anything short of an air strike or an artillery barrage could really hurt this thing. That or the Combined Elements..

K: "KEEP IT BUSY!" I yelled. Idea time.

Scrambling across the ground, I made for the door, my legs agreeing with my brain in that it was time to GTFO. I ran down the hallway, towards the sounds of more gun fire. I needed Twilight..

K: "TWILIGHT!" I yelled at the top of my lungs. "TWILIGHT!"

I found her, at the front-center of two squads from 15th Company. Dr. Allcome and Sunshine were towards the back of the formation - they were surrounded by zombies, and mowing them down in droves.

K: "TWILGIHT!" I screamed, in a panic. "TIARA TIME, -NOW-!" I pointed next to me.

Twilight: "Alright! Cover me!" She said to the pony troops.

15th Co. Officer: "Cover the Element! Ready? Volley fire!" The hazelnut stallion called, and the two squads opened up all at once instead of firing on their own time.

Twilight Teleported next to me, digging in her saddlebag for her Tiara as we took off running back towards the Main Hall.

Twilight: "Is it really that important..?"

K: "YES!" I was frantic. I was actually outpacing her.

We got to the Main Hallway, and there was Slepnir - Nurse Redheart was dragging a semi-conscious Lyra towards the door.

Nurse Redheart: "She's okay!"

K: "GIRLS! ASSEMBLE! IT'S MAGIC TIME! EVERYONE ELSE, DISTRACT THAT THING! PINKIE! THROW ME YOUR KNOX AND SOME SHELLS!" I ran past Twilight, who was setting up in the doorway.

Past Ambrosia, to whom I handed my Patton and its Bandolier.

I passed Pinkie, who just handed me her whole saddle bag ensemble, and her Knox. I dug through the bag and came up with shells. I pulled the chamber open, and the loaded shell - an unfired Flash-Bang - flew out and landed in the open saddle bag. I put in a Fire shell.

K: "TAVI! ON THE LEFT!" I called, just in time for her to back-flip away from the monster's tentacle-like tail.

I wasn't even paying attention to the girls, just making sure I was between the Monster and them. I shouldered the Knox, aimed at its face, and fired the shell.

*Thoook!*

*BLAWOOM!* Went the shell as the incendiary mixture exploded on the creature's neck.

The creature roared in pain and annoyance - I could hear the girls getting ready behind me - and all of a sudden, the monster's horn glowed. I expected a single bolt of purple energy in my direction. What I got was a shower of bolts striking all over the room, randomly.

Twilight: "NOW!"

I could feel the rush of the wind as the magical power of the Elements of Harmony cascaded from the jewels, formed their energy well, and fired forth. At the same instant, as I looked up, I could see a bolt of purple headed right for my face.

The rainbow light of the Elements...

..the purple of the incoming dark magic bolt..

..they impacted right in front of me.

The sonic boom from the collision, and the blinding flash of the magical overload, I could feel the energy reverborate through my own body. I was acutely aware of each individual cell in my body, for one brief moment. The white light filled my vision, filled my mind.. my soul..

..then, I felt absolutely nothing.





TIME: UNKNOWN
DATE: UNKNOWN
LOCATION: UNKNOWN
STATUS: UNKNOWN

K: "Twi.. Twilight.." I called, as I sat up.

Twilight: "Yes?" Her voice was different.. where was she?

I looked around, and shook my head. Rubbing my eyes, I felt a nuzzle at my face. A horse's nuzzle.

..wait, that's a real horse's nose.

K: "Where am I?" I asked, laying on the ground, my vision a blur.

I wasn't able to feel my legs.. or anything else. My body was like rubber.

Twilight: "You're in Dream Castle! Are you friends of Megan and Danny?"

K: "Wh-what..?" I blinked several times. My vision cleared. I saw a pastel pink pony, with white hair and a dark streak in it.

I suddenly realised where I was....

*AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH*

...and freaked out, just a bit.

That made me sit up. MADE me. Oh, yes. I was back -THERE-! I was in the PAST.. I was..

Twilight: "Are you alright?" She asked in a concerned voice.

K: "I'm fine. Now, I am, anyway." I fixed my shirt down a bit.

Spike: "What's the trouble, Twilight?" His voice was gruffer. Less.. less mature.

I forced myself to stand, and checked myslef over. I had everything I'd had the moment it all happened, except Pinkie's Knox. I must've dropped it. That's fine. I still had my uniform, my assault pack, my PA-63, sword, and knife.

Spike: "Ohh! Another human!" He waddled over to me, and extended a little, pink, scaly hand. "I'm-"

K: "Spike, the baby Dragon." I shook hands with him.

Spike: "How'd you know dat?" He blinked.

K: "I come from the future.." My mouth twitched. "Do you know who the Flutter Ponies are?" I looked at Twilight.

Twilight: "Yes! In fact, Firefly is out on a date with one of them right now!" She said, happily.

My heart fell into my intestines somewhere. I wanted to cry. I knew who that was.. I knew what was going to happen.

K: "Where's Megan?" I asked, flatly.

Twilight: "Out in the glade! She's with the SeaPonies." She said, cheerfully.

I nodded, and walked out there.. how would Megan react to me? She was born around 1974, that made her, techncially, a few years older than me. However, as I took note of my surroundings, I deduced she'd be 12, still. I'm.. not nearly that young. I found her playing with the SeaPonies alright..

K: "Megan Williams?" I nodded to her as I came up.

Megan: "Yes? Oh! Who are you?" She stood up right away, but her body language was open and accepting.

K: "My name is K{REDACTED} {REDACTED}. I.." I pulled out my wallet, and showed her my {REDACTED} state Driver's License. "I'm from the future. If you're half the girl I think you are, you'll see my Licence is very much real.. just.. it won't be issued for about twenty years."

Megan looked at my ID.. then to me.. then back at the ID card. I additionally handed her my {REDACTED} Library Card, which was just issued that year, from her perspective.. and how terribly worn out it was. Then, my {REDACTED} State ID card, one of my old, long-cancelled credit cards...

Megan: "Wow.." she was stunned.

K: "If you need further proof.." I dug in my pack.. hey, I packed my Cell Phone for some reason.. and the charger. "..this is a Cell Phone. This model won't be available until 2009, an-"

Megan: "Are the Russians still around?" She asked, with a little fear in her voice.

I remembered how I felt in 1985 through 1991. I knew what Nuclear Weapons were. My dad explained them. He also explained the Soviet Union to me, and we watched Red Dawn together, on HBO one night.

K: "We win the Cold War, Megan, in about six years. The Soviet Union collapses from internal economic problems." I shrugged. "I probably shouldn't have told you, but.. when I was.. when I was in the 1980's, as a little kid, I was scared of them, too." I knelt down, and offered my hand to her. "You don't have to be afraid of them. When I'm from - 2012 - the Soviet Union doesn't exist any more. No nukes." I smiled.

She took my hand.. she reminded me of my nephew, the way her eyes lit up, seeing a wise, older person, willing to share what they know. My nephew is very intelligent. Seems Megan is, too.

Megan: "That's amazing. And no one dies?" She asked with a light of pure hope in her voice.

K: "A few Germans get killed in some of the initial riots, but it's mainly a very peaceful thing. It fills a lot of people with hope for the future. I can't tell you any more, though. I don't want to change our history. You're old enough that, you might change it, by accident, if I told you any more." I shrugged to her.

Megan: "I-I understand. My Dad likes Star Trek.. it's like that episode where they go back to the 1970's and meet that alien who saved Earth from a catastrophe.. or, like.. uh.. the one where Doctor McCoy goes back to the 1920's.."

K: "City on the Edge of Forever. My favourite episode." I smirked. Ohhh.. I was RELISHING this Human Contact. "Megan, can you go freely between this world and Earth?"

Megan: "Yeah! I just have to ride the rainbow." She smiled.

K: "Okay. Can you do me two huge favors? The future of this world might depend on it." I didn't bother to do that condescending adult thing where they lower themselves to a child's height, I looked her in the eye from straight on, with respect.

Megan: "I can try!" She beamed.

K: "First, take my Cell Phone and plug it into an outlet in your room. Hide it, so your parents don't find it. The actual phone part won't work, since cellular towers don't exist, but I have information stored on there that I was going to give to a friend, that I need. The battery died long ago, so, it needs charged so I can get access to it." I handed these to her.

Any computer she'd have, wouldn't hold a candle to the processing power of my cell phone. I couldn't risk, of course, anyone doing a Terminator on me, and reverse-engineering it. But I needed the data on the phone. Reams and reams of weapon schematics and user manuals.. I was going to give them to my bestest bro, M{REDACTED}, so he had them for a Devil May Cry thing he was doing.

Megan: "I can do that. What's the second thing?" She tilted her head a bit.

K: *Small whimper* "Please bring me a hamburger! In the future, all the Ponies are pretty much hard-core vegetarians. I haven't had a hamburger since I arrived there, over two years ago." Well, except the dead cows I'd eaten.. I'd mostly had steaks or the livers and organs.

Megan: "OH! Goodness! That's terrible! I'll do it right away. How long will it take for your phone to charge the battery?" She looked it over.

K: "Uhm.." I thought.. hard. How long did it usually take? "About an hour. Give it ninety minutes, though. And hide it good, it might make a sound when it gets some juice. Once you get back, though, I need to talk to you about something very important."

Megan: "You got it." And off she went, stuffing my cell phone and charger in her pockets.

I re-sorted my wallet.

Twilight Sparkle: "Are things really that bad in the future?" She asked, worried.

K: "Twilight.. what I'm dealing with, won't happen for thousands of years, from your perspective. You'll have a very happy, carefree life. Don't worry about anything, okay?" I said, turning to her. "I promise you, I'll protect everything. No matter what the cost." I smiled to her.

Twilight: "I.. trust you." She said, standing tall and nodding to me.

In the past.. I had so many things I could find out.. clues I could get.. Answers. And I knew how to get back, too. It wouldn't be easy, but I knew exactly how I could get it to work.

Now, I had an advantage.. I had technology again.

Smirking to myself as I saw the Rainbow Bridge activate, I nodded. Yes, Tirek, you may be defeated here already.. but in the future? Science would fuck you.

Harder.

{End of Part 4}

Part 5: Fare thee Well

TIME: 12:33PM (K's Cell Time)
DATE: 24 July 1986 (Megan's Earth Date)
LOCATION: Dream Castle, Thousands of Years in Equestria's Past

While I waited for Megan to get back, I paced around Dream Castle, meeting The Old Ones, as I took to calling them in my head. There were ponies here that I didn't remember being part of Generation 1, that were in a later series. More cases of history not being what I saw on TV. For that matter, Megan wasn't even technically real, if I was right. She would come from a parallel Earth, she had to, in order for me to watch her on TV.

At least this proved the theory of multiple parallel Earths.. shame I couldn't have some theoretical scientists around to rub this in their smug faces. Hopefully, the history I told her, was accurate. And that her parallel Earth didn't have an alternate ending to the Cold War. THAT would depress me. I decided not to think about it as Sugarheart and I had tea.

She was Nurse Redheart's spiritual ancestor. Not a nurse, here, but a nursemaid to the baby ponies, apparently.

Sugarheart: "I'm so glad you like the Tea. I-I was afraid it wouldn't be sweet enough." She blinked a few times.

She reminded me of Fluttershy and Redheart combined.

K: "No, no, it's fine. Actually, it's delicious. I've never had this flavor before." It was true. This particular tea plant must be extinct in the future.

Sugarheart: "So, the future.. is full of war?" She asked, pensively.

K: "I'm afraid it is. But don't let it worry you. There's nothing you can really do to stop it." I reassured her.

Sugarheart: "A-are you sure? I mean.." She trailed off.

I waved one hand, and pet her hoof.

K: "Sugarheart, it happens thousands of years from now. Don't worry about it. Just enjoy your life." I spoke in reassuring tones.

Right before I got a face full of fur.

I sprawled on the ground, being knocked out of my toddler-height seat that I was barely sitting in as it was, and felt warm, canine tongue licking my face.

K: "Not the face! Not the face!!" *BLARGLFARBL!*

Sugarheart: "Havoc!"

Havoc: "Ohhh! Sowwy, Sugarheart!" It sat on my chest.

Alternate history indeed. I didn't remember a cute, fluffy blue wolf pup from Generation 1.

K: "Hi! I'm K!" I said, laying flat, raising one arm up. "Nice to meet you."

Havoc: "I'm Havoc!"

K: "So I gathered." I started scratching him behind the ears as I accepted a cloth from Sugarheart to wipe my face off.

Tex: "Where're'ya, little guy?!" Tex came trotting out from one of the side halls.

K: "Well!" I sat up. "This is certianly a fine day." I hugged and pet on Havoc - hey, just because I'm a jaded human, doesn't mean I don't like cute things. "You must be Tex."

Tex: "Must be!" He nodded firmly.

K: "Haha.. you're my wife's favourite." I smirked. I didn't say it, but, now, looking at him, he was like a cross between Braeburn and Big Mac.

Spiritual ancestry, much?

Danny: "Hey, Tex!" He came running in right then. "Oh! Hey, who're you?"

K: "I'm {YOU KNOW THE DRILL, REDACTED}. I introduced myself to Megan earlier. She went back to your place to do me a couple favors." I shrugged. "I'm from the distant future of Ponyland. We're in the middle of a war, and I got sent back here on accident. I'm trying to take advantage of it, to give us the best possible advantage, so we can win."

Danny: "Oh.. wow.." He came in and sat down on one of the little chairs. "Can I help?"

K: *Chuckle* "Danny, unless you can produce an Armored Division from your backpack, Meagan's giving me all the help you guys can." I shrugged.

Danny: "Uh.. my dad's a lieutenant colonel in the Marines. We live in Washington." He smirked. "It's not in my pocket, but I could-"

K: "I'm also from your future. If you really did ask your dad for help, it could change the future. Your future. In ways you can't imagine. I don't want to be responsible for that." I wagged a finger at him.

Danny: "Oh. Right, right." He nodded, seeming to understand. "Still.." He shrugged. "..how bad is it?"

K: "We're fighting Tirek. He has an army, a country, and more. We've already had over a thousand casualties. It's.. pretty bad." I looked at the company we were keeping. "I don't want to depress anyone.." I shrugged.

Danny: "Come on, we'll go in the kitchen - I'm hungry anyway." He smiled, and led me.

Tex: "Right. Come on, Havoc!" He had to drag Havoc out, the poor pup wanted to play.

In the Kitchen, I learned more about the Williams family. Apparently, Lt. Col. Williams was some kind of high muckity-muck in the Corps. Stuff he couldn't talk about...

Twilight: "Uh... K!" Twilight sounded upset. Ah, shit, now what?

Walking outside, I found Megan alright.. standing next to her father. I immeidately put my hands up.

K: "Colonel.. I'm guessing you saw something you shouldn't have." Oh, great.. now I'm going to fuck up another-

Col. Williams: "Let's talk over here, son." What is it with Marine colonels and calling people 'son'?

Colonel Williams escorted me over to an empty glade. As we walked, I immediately handed over the PA-63. I wasn't dumb, I knew he'd expect me to hand it over in the first place. He examined it. Of course, it didn't look good. The FEG PA-63 was a Warsaw Pact weapon, not NATO..

K: "Colonel, let me begin by thanking you for your service to our country."

Col. Williams: "OUR country?" He looked at me incredulously.

K: "Let's cut the bullshit, Colonel. Seriously. I'm not a Red spy, this isn't a Commie plot, and this world has things in it that are completely pure and innocent. In its future, I'm fighting with everything I have, to keep it that way." I opened my uniform and showed him my scars. All of them. "I think you can appreciate how untouched this world is by our problems, sir. I want it to stay that way."

Col. Williams: "..okay." He shrugged. "When I saw the.. device.. I thought it was.. I don't know. But Megan said someone gave it to her, from beyond.." *Chuckle* "..beyond the rainbow."

K: "Well, Colonel.." I sat down on a rock. "..where do I start? This is a long story. Eh.." I shrugged. "..I've been in the future for a long time. Their future."

I explained everything. Princess Celestia, Luna, the war, Tirek, the technology I had on hand, what I'd created - I showed him a grenade shell from Pinkie's saddle bag - and the exact details of each battle, using rocks as sand tables. He listened with an amazed look on his face.

Col. Williams: "Where'd you train, son?" He asked, honestly shocked.

K: "I didn't. I was rejected for military service." I shrugged. "I'm actually ashamed of it. My grandfather and father both served. So did my stepdad." I lowered my head.

Col. Williams: "Son, if I didn't know better, I'd say you knew more than half the numb-nuts I work with." He smirked.

K: "That means a lot, Colonel." I shrugged again.

Col. Williams: "Now, I know what you're thinkin' - I'm gonna confiscate the device and have the boys in Langley take it apart and see what makes it tick." He gave me an assure dnod.

K: "It would be on my mind, if I was in your shoes, sir." I nodded back to him.

Col. Williams: "City on the Edge of Forever, son." He shrugged a bit.

K: "Pardon?" I blinked.

Col. Williams: "Star Trek?" He leaned in a bit.

K: "OH! Right.. yeah, my favourite episode." I was taken a bit aback.

Col. Williams: "If I get 'hold of this device, and have it reverse engineered, there's a chance a Commie spy could, too. Then where'd we be?" He.. handed me the cell phone and charger. And my PA-63.

K: "You're serious...?" I cocked a brow at him.

Col. Williams: "Only if you are." He nodded to me.

K: "One hundred percent, Colonel." I nodded to him.

Col. Williams: "Good. That means Megan was right - you are trustworthy. I brought you some things I thought you might be able to use. She told me everything she knew." He stood, shrugged, and started walking back.

K: "Colonel.."

Col. Williams: "Son, if you're in half the danger your stories make you out to be, you need all the help you can get." He shrugged. "This place is special to my kids.. I'm a parent, too, not just a Marine. If it means helping save lives, I'll do whatever I can. Well, within the limits of what I'm able to do."

K: "Alright.. then I feel it only important to warn you of a couple of things." I said, my tone serious again.

Col. Williams: "Alright."

K: "Don't fly out of Scotland in two years, don't be in Oklahoma City in nineteen ninety four, don't be in New York City in two-thousand-and-one, and it's fifteen thousand Rontgen, not three-point-six." I said flatly.

Col. Williams: "Considering you're still alive, I'm guessing these aren't world-ending events, but bad enough you don't want me to be anywhere near 'em. And that last one.." He looked down, then up. "I think I get it."

K: "Damn straight, sir. And, I'm glad." I nodded gently at him.

Col. Williams: "Alright, then." He gestured in the distance. "Let's get you back to the.. uh.."

K: "Dream Castle, Colonel." I nodded. "This way."

When we came back to Dream Castle, Megan and Danny were there, next to a large duffel bag. Colonel Williams dug in it and showed me the things he'd bright along to help me. A couple military field manuals, user manuals for every U.S. military issue small arm and guides to Warsaw Pact weapons, a solar powered calculator, two pounds of different kinds of gun powder, a reloading manual complete with information on every caliber around at that time, a Marine Corps Ka-Bar, some basic tools, and a revolver. A Smith & Wesson Model 19, with a nice leather shoulder rig, and some extra ammo.

K: "Really, Colonel?" I hefted the revolver.

Col. Williams: "I figure you'll put this stuff to use." He shrugged.

K: "The gunpowder alone will be a huge advance. If I can have it reverse-engineered, it'll improve the quality of our weapons.. immensely. And a Model 19?" I grinned at it.

Col. Williams: "Eh, the kids get to shoot it sometimes.." He smirked.

Danny: "I don't mind." He nodded, with a broad grin.

K: "I'll put it to good use, Colonel. Trust me." I put my extra things and Pinkie's saddle bags in the duffel bag. "If for some reason it turns out we're actually from the same Earth, and I end up being able to get back to where I came from, I'll be sure to return this."

Col. Williams: "If you can't, don't worry about it." He nodded. "Alright, Megan, take me home." *Chuckle* "Before my OD's get painted pastel pink or somethin'."

Megan: "Okay, Daddy." She started walking towards where the Rainbow Bridge activated at.

K: "Oh, Megan?"

Megan: "Yes?"

K: "You'll need the Rainbow of Light in the future, but do me a favor and leave some clues to where you end up putting it, would you? I'm going to need it in OUR future." I shrugged.

Megan: "No problem."

Col. Williams: "Take care.. General K---." He stood and saluted me.

I saluted him back as he and Megan walked away.

Saluted by a Marine. My wife would rape me for this.


TIME: 18:33 (K's Cell Time)

I was in Dream Castle, borrowing a few things to sketch out - a map of the area was a big one. Some notes on history I thought were important, was another.

Twilight: "Are you really going to try and get back to.. where you came from?" She tilted her head at me.

K: "Oh, yes. I already know how I'm going to do it, too." I said, putting the book up.

I'd taken pictures of several things during the time here, and I was going to take full advantage of every bit of information I could get. I strapped on Colonel Williams' Model 19, and made myself ready.

K: "Remember, Twilight. Don't worry about this. Have fun. Enjoy your life." I hugged her, and as I started to leave Dream Castle, I ended up hugging all of the new friends I'd made during my short few hours here. I deliberately avoided contact with Ancient Norfy and Firefly.

Havoc: "Are you sure I can't come with?" He yipped.

K: "I'm sure, Havoc. I wish you could, but it's for the best that you stay here. But, remember, we're friends, okay?" I said, as I exited the castle.

Havoc: "BE SAFE, K!" He called after me.

I started walking.. and walking.. and walking. I knew the route, but I couldn't let anyone follow me. Not for any reason. Where I was going, they couldn't know about.


TIME: 23:37 (K's Cell Time)
LOCATION: Future site of Canterlot (supposedly)

Just as I suspected, there was something here. A small building made of fine stone, right where the castle should be, or so I thought. I stood there and brushed off my coat.

K: "GALACTICA SPARK, GET YOUR FLANK OUT HERE!" I called.

And a very tall horse, absolutely exhuding magical energy stepped out from the side of the building, with two little foals - anicent Luna and Celestia.

Galactica: "Who dares address me in such a manner?" She eyed me up, then looked at her elder daughter's flank. "..oh, crabapples."

K: "We need to talk." I said, firmly.

She paced up to me, and gave me the once-over, visually and magically scanning me for.. I wasn't sure what.

Galactica: "I don't think we have any-"

K: "Firefly and Norpheus." Norfy's ancient name. Like Morpheus, with an N.

Galactica: *Thuncer clap* "How dare-"

K: "I'll go to the ponies and tell them what you're planning. Everything. I know it. You know I'm from the future. I could go out and change that future, and kill all of the future's enemies right this second, all by myself. Then have the ponies rebel against you.. overthrow your Godhood." I leaned in, with narrowed eyes.

Galactica: *Tersely* "Or..?"

K: "You send me back to the future. And I don't mean my Earth." I crossed my arms. "I may be vulnerable to magic, but I could easily take you right now, with what I have at my disposal. I'm human, I'm a creature of science, and right now, Science could Fuck You."

Galactica: *Annoyed* "But..?"

K: "But I want to go back to the future of this land, where I belong, and help my friends.. to stop the war there." I shrugged my shoulders, just a bit.

Galactica: *Frustrated* "Do you have any idea what you're asking!? It would be as if you asked me to cast a pebble over a cliff and land it on a butterfly's flank!" She snorted.

K: "You're a Goddess. Improvise." I said, flatly.

Galactica: *Defeated Sigh* "It.. would take me some time to calculate. I may be able to do it, though." She shook her head.

K: "Come get me when you're ready. I'll be waiting." I nodded to her.

I nodded, and walked over to the edge of a cliff. I sat down, hugging Colonel Williams' duffel bag, and forcing myself to try and sleep.. when I felt something cover me.

Filly Celestia: "Woona an' I di'int want you to be cowld." She said, sliding the blanket over me with her teeth.

K: "Thank you, Celestia." I smiled.

Filly Celestia: "How d'you know my nayme?" She had the mentality of a five-year-old.

K: "Because you and I become really good friends in the future, after you're all grown up and learn to raise the sun all by yourself." I nodded. She wouldn't remember this anyway.

Filly 'Woona': "You'za okay, mista?" She blinked her big ol' eyes at me.

K: "I sure am, little one. I'm going to go to the future and help you two fight a big, bad monster." I smiled. "It'll be okay, though. We will win, because we become really good friends later. And friendship, is a magic all its own."

Filly Celestia: "I twust you." She nuzzled me. "Come on, Woona, befow Mommy catches us!"

They didn't notice, but I snapped a quick pic of them on my cell phone. Time enough for vanity. They ran off as fast as their cute little legs would carry them.


TIME: 04:43 (K's Cell Time)
DATE: 25 July 1986 (Megan's Earth Date)

I woke up to Galactica standing over me. She seemed upset, but calm.

Galactica: "It seems my daughters trust you." She said, somewhat terse.

K: "We become friends in the future." I said, sitting up and putting my glasses on. "Are you ready?"

Galactica: "More than ready." She trailed off. "..my daughters would not stop talking about you last night. They.. made me realise that you're not a threat. So, instead of tricking you and sending you to Limbo, I contacted someone to pick you up." She looked away, frustrated. "My daughters would never forgive me if I hurt you."

K: "Works." I shrugged. "I didn't set out to cause problems. I just want to fix them."

Dr. Whooves: "K!" He ran over from out behind the building. "Ohhh.. you are in SO much trouble!"

K: "DOC!" I practically tackled him to the ground, hugging him. "Oh, Sweet Celestia, I'm so happy to see you!"

Dr. Whooves: *Grk!* "Air! Air! Not immortal Time Lord anymore.. need air!" He patted my arm.

K: "OH! Sorry." I stood up, picking up my duffel bag. "What, did you-"

Dr. Whooves: "Let's just say I'm breaking a lot of rules again. But Derpy would kill me if I didn't help." He handed me a handkerchief. "Blindfold, please."

K: "I understand." Blindfolding myself, I stuck my glasses in my pocket. He led me somewhere, I was sat down, there was a lot of timey-wimey stuff, and..


TIME: 17:30 ERST
DATE: War Day 179
LOCATION: Dream Castle

I heard my duffel bag hit the ground, and then I was deposited on my ass from a short height.

Dr. Whooves: "And from now on, please, K. NO MORE TIMEY-WIMEY STUFF!" I heard.. a noise, and once I heard nothing again, I took off the blindfold.

I stood, and realised I was right outside the Main Hall. Right by the broken window. Putting my glasses back on, I called out..

K: "APPLEJACK?! TWILIGHT!? ANYONE?!"

15th Company Sergeant: *GASP!* "GENERAL K!" He ran over. "General!" And hugged me. A pony I'd never met before. "Oh! Celestia be Praised! You're alright!"

K: "I'm fine, where are the Elements of Harmony?"

15th Company Sergeant: "Right this way, General." He said, leading me back around to the front.

All I could think of, as I stared at the forest surrounding Dream Castle was...

..it was great to be home.
