Part 1: Vines of Fate

TIME: 09:17 Central European Time
DATE: War Day 1009, 7 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Marenaco Grand Prix Racegrounds, Principality of Marenaco

Vines were coming out of the ground in several places, now. Ponies were being grabbed seemingly at random, and turned into plant monster mutations. I felt this had to be Tirek's doing, but a nagging feeling - the Sword of Rainbow's Light pulling at the back of my mind - was trying to say differently.

K: "Weapons Check!" I called out, as Forest Spirit, Norfy, Applejack, and Steela unslung their bags, and started passing out long arms and bandoliers.

Forest Spirit: "We brought party favors." He nodded.

I had Norfy, Gaze, Cosmic, Forest Spirit, Redheart, Applejack, Dusty, Steela, Dusk, Rarity, Sunset, Trixie, Rainbow Dash, Gilda, Rainbow McSherbet, Fluttershy, Golden, and Broken all with me.

Sacquet had himself, Julienne, and La Boche.

My team had been thoughtful enough to bring extra party favors. We were passing out what we had with us.

Timber Spruce: "Give me one." He saluted. "Staff Sergeant Timber Spruce, Coltorado Militia Rangers, reporting."

Rainbow Shine: "Better give me one, too, Spirit." She held her hoof out.

Forest Spirit: "Alright." He handed both of them stockless Ridgway SMG's. "We'll have to get some more rifles from the Marenicans."

K: "This'll do." I hefted my Grant Carbine and loaded it, running the bolt.

Sacquet: "Ze Marenicans use Prench weapons, of course, Mon Ami." He nodded, chamber-checking his pistol. "You would think I would learn." He smirked, holding it up. "But, last time? I was fine, non?"

K: "Yeah." I nodded. "Let's go. Staging area." I pointed.

We evacuated the announcer's cabin, and sent the ponies in there running for cover as we moved down the stands towards the Staging Area.

We had a little excitement when several of the vines saw us as potential prey. We also figured out right quick that intense gunfire and grenades will kill them off temporarily. Fire (Sunset) was by far the most effective.

Sacquet: "The last time I engaged with only this?" He reloaded his pistol expertly. "We fought Tirek's brigands." And smirked. "It is nice to have some field duty once more."

K: "Don't push it - if I kick, you'n Forest have to take over for me." I nodded.

Forest Spirit: "No kidding!" He stomped one of the vines HARD, and shot it off with his stockless Ridgway.

Julienne: "Oui! AND YOU MUST come back to a Lady, me amore." She slithered past him, reloading her own Ridgway. "You will have foals to raise soon enough." And smirked.

Sacquet: "OUI!?" He beamed a grin a thousand miles wide.

K: "Julienne, that means you're staying out of trouble as soon as we get somewhere safe." I wagged a finger at her.

Julienne: "Oui, mon ami." She flicked her tail.

Most of the civilians made it off the race grounds just fine, jumping fences and climbing over walls to get away. We managed to get to the staging area without further incident.

The Gendarmes Battalion of Marenaco was assembling. They had 1 Armored Company with 1 Platoon of Citroen P4's (6 P4/37's, 2 P4 Cargos), and two Platoons of Somua S-3's (16 tanks). The rest were all Hoof Infantry or Mechanized Infantry with Citroen P4 APC Half Tracks.

Colonel Marche Forte: "Général K!" He saluted. "Général Sacquet. Commandant Spirit." And nodded to his rapidly assembling forces. "Marenaco's Gendarmes stand ready for orders! At your command, sirs!"

Sacquet: "We start by evacuating. Two APC's, covered by a quatre trente-sept ("four/thirty seven" referencing the P4/37 armored cars) and a squad of rifles. Make that a team, advance to the spectator areas, evacuate civilians." He nodded.

K: "The vines are spreading all over the track - the cameras are still in operation. I want some of your S-3's and infantry to cover the Camera Booth. I need that intel." I nodded to him.

Forest Spirit: "As usual, K's team'll advance and find out what's going on in there, and kick its ass." He smirked.

K: "Get me naval support, as well - I don't care who's. And I want Tac Air." I nodded. "Sacquet, you stay here and coordinate. Julienne, La Boche? Keep him out of trouble."

Sacquet: "OUI! Mon ami! You shall have it." He nodded firmly.

K: "Colonel, give me one of your APC's. I'll need the mobility." I nodded.

Col. Forte: "You may take my own! And whatever arms we have to spare!" He gestured to his HQ APC. "Bonne chance, Mon Ami!"

Gaze: "Awright, lads, been a bit - we best not be rusty, aye?" He passed out some of the Prench Md.1002M rifles, while Dusk, Rarity, and Sunset took FP-2 precision rifles. Applejack traded her stockless Ridgway for a FC-1 Shotgun.

Norfy: "I think we'll do." He smirked a bit.

Dusk: "You three are supposed to be among the best we have." He grinned. "I'm eager to see what you can really do."

Cosmic: "Ahh.." He shrugged. "It's just that we've known K a long time."

Forest Spirit: "Yeah. Don't worry, we'll show you the ropes." He nudged Dusk.

Dusk: "Says the former Forest Ranger." He nudged back. "I'll let you know if I need help finding a lost hiker." And smirked.

Male Bonding does not change much, even between Equine and Human.

So, we piled into the half-track. I drove. I was not too well versed on manual transmission vehicles, but I made it work.

About half way back to where we started, the vines started firing from the ground in larger numbers.. and larger sizes. They seemed to be.. hunting.. for something. Like, they were FEELERS, not grabbers.

Gaze: "Izzit me imagina'shun, or is they lookin' fer sumthin'?!" He shouted.

K: "It looks like it!" I nodded, skidding past one. "SomeTHING.. or SOMEONE!?" I shot a look back at the others.

Applejack: "If'n that's the case, why ain't we gettin' more trouble?!" She replied, keeping her shotgun aimed, but being careful and not firing, as they hadn't decided to come after us. "If it's Tirek, wouldn't he take a shot at US?!"

Forest Spirit: "Then it's not Tirek!" He yelled, hanging on, and almost flying out of the side, before lowering himself a bit in the troop compartment.

Broken: "NOT Tirek!? Then WHO?!" He asked, ducking a vine that slithered overhead.

There was a pause.

Timber: "I-I.. I think I know what this is!" He sounded pained, saddened, by his realization. "We have to find Stinger!" He leaned in next to me. "They say you listen when someone's offering an alternatitve idea - well, I'm offering! Sir!"

I paused, then heaved the wheel over.

K: "Fifth turn! I saw him last, over there!" I called out.

Trixie: "This is CRAZY!" She sneered, as she charged a bolt of energy, and let it fly at a vine coming a bit close. "Alright, Miss Prissy - let's see your Combat Magic!"

Rarity: "..indeed, Darling." She smirked, and raised a hoof to her side, suddenly summoning quartz from the ground like a Claymore Mine. She used this to form a partial hard shield around us.

Dusk: "Hey, not bad." He smirked, and used his own magic to reinforce the shield with a magical backing. "Trixie, keep the vines off us."

Trixie: "As IF.." She fired a trio of bolts. "..that would be a problem." And smirked at Rarity. "DAR-LING."

Applejack: "OVER THAR!" She slapped my shoulder, and pointed.

Indeed, I could see Sky Stinger on the ground, knocked out. There were vines encroaching on his position.

Dusk: "Shift the shield!" He pointed.

K: "Hang on!" I skidded us to a stop (and in a half-track this heavy, it wasn't much of a skid, even in the soft ground). "Grab him up!"

I stood in the driver's seat, hefting my weapon.

Timber was the first one out, Rainbow Shine the second. They ran over to him, just in time for one of the Vines to grab him around the belly and lift him into the air, mere inches ahead of Rarity and Dusk's shield.

Not to transform him, though..

..I jumped down, and wagged my arm for my team to spread out.

Forest Spirit: "..what's going on here, K?" He leaned over a bit and said that in low tones.

K: "Not sure." I nodded for him to keep his eyes peeled.

Timber Spruce: "GLORY! NO!" He yelled out. "GLORY, STOP THIS! STOP THIS RIGHT NOW! SKY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT! AND YOU KNOW IT!" He yelled out, letting his weapon go slack on its sling, as he advanced, arms out, on his hind legs. "COME ON, SIS! DON'T DO THIS!"

Cosmic: "..sis?!" He looked over to me.

K: "Let it play." I nodded.

Timber Spruce: "SIS!" He paused, paced a bit, and looked between the vines and the nearby trees. "COME ON, WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS!"

Voice: "TALK!? THAT'S WHAT GOT US INTO THIS MESS! I have the power to END this! To take REVENGE! And DAMN you, I absolutely WILL!"

The voice echoed from the trees all around us, as though the leaves themselves had a voice.

Timber Spruce: "GLORY! This isn't the way! THIS ISN'T HOW WE SETTLE PROBLEMS! THIS IS NOT.. NOT OUR WAY!" He looked all around him, not sure where to talk to.

Glory's Voice: "IT WAS OUR WAY ONCE! A THOUSAND YEARS PAST! AND IT SHOULD BE AGAIN! I have the power, now.. our power. Our race's power. AND I INTEND TO USE IT! I'm going to.. going to make sure everyone knows we can't be pushed around! NEVER AGAIN! EVER.. AGAIN!"

K: "Come out!" I demanded, having enough of her bull shit. "COME OUT! AND LEAVE SKY ALONE!" I stepped forwards. "YOU GUTLESS COWARD!"

Ahead of me, a tree suddenly.. morphed a face.. with a cruel smirk. A crown of flowers and vines drooped over its forehead.

Glory: "I am Gloriosa Daisy.. and I am the TERRAN PONY GODDESS OF NATURE'S REVENGE!"

Part 2: Nature's Revenge

TIME: 09:37 Central European Time
DATE: War Day 1009, 7 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Marenaco Grand Prix Racegrounds, Principality of Marenaco

Trixie: "Oh, yeah?! I AM THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXIE! I HAVE MASTERED DEATH ITSELF! YOU ARE -NOTHING- TO US!" She shrilly screeched at the face-tree.

Only to get thwacked by a vine across the midsection and sent flying into Dusk like a bowling ball, butt first.

Dusk: "Man! At least that was a soft landing!" He levitated her off, and at my hand signal, scattered to avoid incoming fire.

Trixie: "Only for you, -ALPHA-!" She flirted, as she was moved off of him.

K: "SPREAD OUT!" I pointed to Stinger, ignoring the passionate combat comment. "RARITY! SHRED THAT VINE!"

Applejack: "NAOW, RARES!" She raised her shotgun, and I noted that her magazine tube had a RED cap on it - the (supposed to be NEIGHTO universal) symbol for a shotshell tube preloaded with Flare Shells.

Rarity: "RELEASE HIM!" She swirled the quartz into a torrent, and fired them at the vine holding Sky Stinger, as Applejack unloaded the whole tube - flare shells flying and intermixing with the quartz shards.

I moved far, far right with Redheart and covered her as she, Norfy, and Forest Spirit moved in to recover Stinger. Norfy froze vines solid. I just shot them.. before realizing that my Md1002 wasn't as effective as I'd like. So, I drew the Sword of Rainbow's Light.

Time to hack-n-slash.

Timber Spruce: "GLORY! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?" He was still trying to talk to her - and for her part, she wasn't attacking him.

Glory's Voice: "I HAVE FOUND THE POWER! THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE! POWER LONG LOST BY OUR PONY RACE! THE POWER OF GAEA!"

Her form melted out from the tree itself. Her pinkish pony body was partially taken over by green vines and leaves. The sides of her eyes were darkened into a rose color in a leaf-like mask. Her sclera were black, eyes glowing yellow.

And around her neck? A cluster of glowing rocks.

Sunset: "OH! That's.. NOT what I think it is, is it?!" She yelled out, sending a firebolt to cover Trixie.

Trixie: "If your guess was Gaea's Geodes, you're right, hotshot!" She tucked and rolled under the vine as the firebolt hit it, and fired four purple-pink lasers to intercept more incomings.

Timber Spruce: "HOW do we STOP her, then?!" He asked, desperately.

Gloriosa Daisy: "YOU DON'T!" She.. her voice echoed when she spoke. "WE ARE THE SPIRIT OF THE TERRAN PONY RACE!"

Forest Spirit and Redheart grabbed Sky Stinger and we pulled him back from the tendrils of vines being shot out at us fromt he ground.

It figured, to me - if there were Unicorn Supremacists, there'd be something on each other side that would have similar feelings, right? And Celestia's works 1,000 years ago.. while they mended bridges, each component race wouldn't dare give up any special power items they had to protect themselves.. just in case things went wrong.

This was very bad.

K: "..FALL BACK! WE NEED TOOLA ROOLA!" I had a plan.

I didn't think bullets would work well, here.

Instead of running for the APC, we ran PAST it - I knew she'd disable it. And we kept running. Rarity erected another shield of quartz behind us. Trixie and Dusk both reinforced it. Sunset gave extra cover with a flame mantle over us, and Norfy had an ice mist inside that.

We were a turtle shell, running back to the assembly area.

K: "We need the Elements. Guns aren't going to work well, here." I announced.

Timber Spruce: "You mean.. we.." He looked at me while running.

Sunset: "He's SAYING he doesn't WANT to HAVE to kill your SISTER!" She nudged his flank with her snout. "Now, keep running, Ranger!"

She was right. My other solution was to kill her. I'd rather not do that. I hated the idea of killing someone that was very likely emotionally distraught, misunderstood, and being taken advantage of, by powers beyond their control.

Timber Spruce: "She was NEVER like this before!" He called out, as we got back to the assembly area.

The rest of the team was here, including Toola.

K: "TOOLA! MAGIC TIME!" I called out, pointing to her.

Toola Roola: "Alright." She nodded, getting her Elemental Jewelry on.

The rest of the girls quickly did the same. The rest of the civilians had all been evacuated here, as well, and were being herded on Troop Carriers and 2-ton trucks to points out of the danger zone.

A flight of Prench MS.401's screeched overhead.

I held my hand out for the mic, and Elsie and Cosmic both offered. I grabbed Cosmic's.

K: C> "Alpha Actual to aircraft. ID with call sign."

Rouge One: C> "Rouge Flight. Rouge One through Six. Reporting in, Général. Armament is machine guns only. Prepared for ground support."

K: C> "Roger, Rouge One. Stay on station, prepare to respond." I nodded to Col. Forte. "ETA on some real ordnance?"

Col. Forte: "Oui. Ten minutes and you will have fighter-bombers vith high explosive bombs." He nodded.

Sacquet: "Three Prench destroyers are headed this way at top speed. ETA is twenty minutes. Ze Roamans send two Citta-class Corvettes. ETA ten minutes." He shrugged. "Heavier units will take some time. Ze Roaman 15th Infantry Regiment is on zee way and will be here in 25 minutes with infantry and light mortar. Ze Nice Militia Battalion is mobilized and will arrive soon with tanks and artillery. Ten, fifteen minutes." He shrugged.

K: "Good, we have alternatives, if this doesn't work." I nodded. "If what I'm about to try doesn't work, plaster this whole area with artillery fire for about 200 total rounds out, follow up with infantry and tanks. You'll be shooting at a pony with a pinkish coat and black eyes." I wagged my fingers at my eyes a bit. "If we can't stop her, you have to kill her." I nodded. "Elements, and Timber, on me. The rest of you.." I pointed right at Dusk and Forest Spirit. "..STAY HERE!"

Sherby: "Are you serious?" He frowned.

K: "Yes, Rainbow, I am." I nodded to him. "Ask Spirit." I looked at Forest Spirit.

Forest Spirit: "He means it." He patted McSherbet on the shoulder. "This is something for the Elements of Harmony, first. We get our crack at it if they fail."

K: "Exactly." I nodded, and motioned for the girls to follow me.

Toola Roola: "Catch me up." She nodded.

Sunset: "I'm interested in Timber, here, but his sister is being a bitch." She smirked as she sauntered on to the battlefield.

Rarity: *AHEM!* "More that, darling, Timber's sister has acquired the ancient Power of Gaea and intends to use it to purge non-Earth Ponies or subjugate them. I am not certain which, though.." She fluffed her mane out. "..I have no intention of going quietly into that good night, darling."

K: "Exactly." I nodded. "She's possessed by Gaea's spirit, I think. And if that's the case, we need to divide it from her mortal body." I gestured. "Hence.."

Applejack: "We's need'n the combined Elements." She whinnied a bit.

Timber: "She.. was never like this before.." He frowned, a bit depressed. "I don't really know what happened. When we left Coltorado to start racing, I mean.. the camp was okay.."

K: "Well, we'll fix it. Somehow. I promise." I patted his shoulder.

Sunset: "Should work." She nodded. "Once the Spirit of Gaea is out of her, we'll probably have to seal it." She frowned.

K: "We'll need the Power of Love, then the Power of either Light or Darkness." I shrugged. "Your call Sunset - Celestia or Sombra?"

Sunset: "Sombra." She nodded firmly. "Celestia would empower her. She's Earth - Earth needs Sun to flourish."

K: "Got it." I drew the Sword of Rainbow's Light, and hefted it, slinging my Md.1002 rifle.

We had a plan, now. We just needed the strength to carry it out. If this didn't work, we'd have to demolish a tenth of Marenaco to make sure we killed her. I'd rather not do that.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Avenging Nature

TIME: 10:01 Central European Time
DATE: War Day 1009, 7 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Marenaco Grand Prix Racegrounds, Principality of Marenaco


Just in case we met more monsters, the girls rearmed for the task ahead. Applejack had the FC-1 Shotgun. Sunset and Rarity both were carring FP-2 sniper's rifles. Toola had a MAT-4/9. Rainbow Dash had an AA-1. Fluttershy, Timber and I had Md-1002M's.

We headed back for the half-track we abandoned. Seemed to be the right place to find her. And, indeed, she left us a trail away from it. Big pools of darkness with shimmering gems, in a pattern like hoofprints. They led away from the raceway and towards a large hotel building.

K: C> "Alpha to Marenaco-One."

Col. Forte: C> "Go, Alpha."

K: C> "We've tracked her to a hotel on the east-northeast side of the raceway. Has that area been evacuated?"

Col. Forte: C> "Non, Alpha."

K: C> "Any forces sent over there?"

Col. Forte: C> "Zee Roaman 15th was to enter zat area from the East and evacuate when they arrived."

K: C> "Roger that - call them off. Have them enter from another direction. She's there. Alpha, out."

Col. Forte: C> "Oui, Alpha. Marenaco-One, acknowledged."

Sunset: "This isn't good. I think her power is growing." She frowned.

Timber: "Just like the legends." He huffed. "That camp we were talking about saving - the spirit of Gaea supposedly lives there." He looked back at us, a bit ashamed. "I have a feeling I know where Glory got her powers from. I think.. somehow.. she managed to find whatever there is for Gaea's powers."

Sunset: "That.. I think that tracks with the legends." She looked over to Rarity and Fluttershy.

Fluttershy: "I'm not sure." She frowned.

Rarity: "That's as good of a guess as any, darlings." She shrugged.

K: "Alright. Let's move - stagger column. Watch for plant monsters." I said, taking the lead, as usual.


TIME: 10:09 Central European Time
LOCATION: Summers Grand Hotel, Principality of Marenaco


"Gaea" - or, whatever was possessing Glory - had pulled her defenses in towards the hotel itself. Once we got there, we found the front entrance encased in vines. A few "plant zombi-ponies" were milling around out front.

K: "Mmm.. gonna err on the side of caution - take them out." I nodded to Rarity.

Rarity: "Oh, of course, darling." She set up on a bench, and quickly picked off the plane revenants with her FP-2 Rifle.

Timber: "This is crazy." He hefted an axe from his gear. "Let's see if we can cut our way in."

We advanced to the vine-blocked door. Timber started chopping with all of his might, but to no avail. Every damage he inflicted to the vines, was healed almost instantly.

Timber: "Satchel Charge the wall, General?" He looked to me.

K: "..just K, Sergeant." I nodded. "You're in CAG, now." I patted his shoulder. "Let me try something."

I gently pressed the Sword of Rainbow's Light to the vines.. and I thought back to Granny.. Applejack.. my link with her. I didn't realize it, but I started to glow. The vines obeyed me when I bid them to retreat..

..I was mastering the Earth Power of the Sword. I had the ability to - locally - keep these vines at bay.

Sunset: "Whoa.. amazing!" She paced up next to me. "How did you do that?"

K: "Granny Smith. She showed me the power of Earth Magic." I hefted the sword, and looked at it.

Applejack: "Mmm. Mah honeybun's got some magic hisself now." She slinked up next to me and gave me a side-of-head nudge. "Naew come on, everypony. We got ponies to save."

K: "Let's go." I nodded, and led the way in.

As we made our way in, I could see that not all of the ponies and other races here, had been turned into zombies. Many were simply encased in vines.

Sunset: "..don't quote me on this, but I think the vines are draining whatever latent mana they have." She nudged one of the cocoons with the tip of her rifle.

Rainbow Dash: "This is KILLER creepy." She frowned.

Fluttershy: "If you think that's bad, Dash, there's no animals in here. I can't hear any of them." She sighed, almost sad, but with an edge of determination.

Rarity: "What is she AFTER, then, darlings?" She shrugged a bit.

Toola Roola: "I dunno - what makes this hotel so special?" She shrugged.

Timber: "..Sky's dad is here." He blinked. "Yeah, no, I'm sure of it. The Summers Grand Hotel? He's mentioned staying here a few times." And lowered his head a bit. "K." He looked up at me, falling in pacce to be at my side. "If we can't.." He looked down and away. "..she's my sister."

K: "I won't ask you to take the shot, Timber." I shrugged. "Ranger or not, that's a step too far-"

Timber: "No, that's exactly why I want to be the one to do it." He nodded firmly, looking me right in the eye. "She's my sister. This is her doing. I should be the one to set this right."

Sunset: "Oh, Timber!" She slid up next to him. "No, no.. come on. We've all killed before. We know the pain.. I.. I know a lot of pain." She nuzzled him, horse-like. "I can't ask you to do that. K said HE can't.."

Timber: "Thanks." He blushed a bit. "For years, it's just been me and her. I wanted to leave at one point, and move to Coltorado Springs, but.." He shrugged a bit. "The camp was important to our family."

Sunset: "Look, you." She stopped, and put her foreleg around his neck. "I get that kind of pain. If it comes down to it, let one of us do it, if we have a clear shot at her. Let.. let me do it." She lowered her head a bit. "If last night meant ANYthing.. then you have to let me take some of your pain, too." She raised her head, looking him in the eyes.. and he met her gaze. "That's what a relationship's about. We share the pain. Same as we share the joy."

Timber: "..okay, Sunset." He smiled, blushing.

Applejack smirked at me, and, wiggling her eyebrows, crossed both sets of her legs over each other, and leaned a bit into me. Like.. she'd somehow set all this up.

Had she?

My little match maker.

Part 4: Green Envy

TIME: 10:12 Central European Time
DATE: War Day 1009, 7 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Summers Grand Hotel, Principality of Marenaco


We advanced up the stairs. The air was dead still, and the further up we got, the darker it got, with vines blocking the windows. We switched to flashlights. There was almost no sound.

Timber: "He'll be in the executive suite." He nodded, as we ascended to the top floor.

K: "We need to try and rescue him if possible." I nodded.

I was at the head of the stack. Timber was behind me. Sunset was behind him, and AJ behind her. Fluttershy and Dash were on the wing, floating by us. Toola and Rarity brought up the rear.

Tension. Like every other monster we'd faced, there was tension. I was also committing a major hero mistake: I was about to hold back. Majorly. We could absolutely demolish her with a concentrated Napalm strike. We were going to engage her on her level, instead.

That's a major hero mistake. Never engage the enemy fairly. Always overpower them. Don't let them monologue. Kill them immediately. I was breaking all these rules - the girls knew it, but they were backing my play anyway.

We got to the top floor, and all the hallways had been overgrown with those vines. It was almost perfectly still up here, with just a trickle of light coming down from above, from the skylights. The path to the Executive Suite seemed to be stretching perfectly before us.

The girls had their Elemental Jewelry on already. As we got to the midpoint of the hall, I just discarded my rifle. Close quarters - I'd be better off with a handgun. My hand went to the Sword of Rainbow's Light, and I drew it out. Its normally comforting weight was.. no comfort. I knew.. I just knew, I was making a mistake.

We got to the door to the Executive Suite, and I bid the vines to retreat. Opening the door, we entered.

K: "GAEA!" I called out.

Timber: "GLORY! SIS!" He screamed, desperately.

The girls fanned out, watching their sectors.

Glory/Gaea: "YOU COME!" She hissed, slithering into the light on a long, thick vine that held her up.

Stinger's father was next to her, held tightly in a wrapping of vines.

Sky Wind: "G-General..!" He wheezed out.

Glory/Gaea: "SILENCE!" She squeezed his vines tighter... tighter.. I could hear bones cracking.

K: "Let. Him. Go." I stated, plainly.

She responded by doing so.. but the body she tossed to our feet had been crushed beyond recognition.

K: "..so much for that.." I frowned.

Timber: "GLORY! Glory.. sis.. PLEASE! Come BACK to me! It's ME, TIMBER! YOUR BROTHER! I.." He paced a bit forwards. "..I love you sis!" He was starting to cry. "You mean everything to me. Yeah, the.. the camp is.. it's so important.. but it's nothing without you! Please, sis. Please."

There WAS a pause.

I gripped the sword a bit tighter.

Glory: "T-Tim..ber?" She said, her sclera fading whiter for a moment.

Her head shook, and the dark sclera came back.

Gaea: "NO! WE WILL NOT BE-"

K: "FULL POWER, NOW! CADENCE, GIVE ME STRENGTH!"

Sunset: "FULL POWER!"

The Elements of Harmony struck the sword with a force strong enough to make the floor shudder and creak. We'd all gotten stronger. We hit Gaea straight in the chest. The energy flowed through her and over her. I reached out and grabbed Timber's shoulder.

I needed -his- love for his sister.

Gaea screamed. I watched as, after a struggle, Glory's body was ejected at high velocity from the center, and hit the wall hard.

Gaea was freed.

The elemental beam subsided.. we stepped back, panting hard.

Gaea: "YOUR POWER IS MEANINGLESS. I HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED!" She reached her arms out, and started firing energy beams at us.

Glory: "Th-the.. GEODES! AIM FOR THE GEODES!" She yelled, desperately, painfully.

K: "Right!" I nodded. "SOMBRA, GIVE ME STRENGTH! CORE OF DARKNESS!"

Instead of doing a second Element of Harmony blast, I elected to fire Sombra's power from the sword. A massive ball of inky blackness, surrounded by a dark purple aura, launched itself like a cannon ball at her. I aimed right at the Geode Cluster. It impacted, and the Darkness squeezed around it.

Gaea: "THE DARKNESS!? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!" She screamed, and all the vines all around us started to CONTRACT.. and CRUSH the building.

Sunset: C> "ALPHA TO ANY CALLSIGN, WE HAVE HOSTAGES IN THE FIRST FLOOR! THEY NEED IMMEDIATE EVAC!"

Havoc: C> "This is Hunter and Ares Actual! We're breaching now!"

Rapid Bearing: C> "Actual, this is Alpha Three Seven! The building is coming apart! GET OUTTA THERE!"

I couldn't let go.

K: "TIMBER! GET YOUR SISTER AND GET OUT OF HERE!" I called to him.

He ran over to Glory, and grabbed her up.

Timber: "What about you!?"

K: "GO, RANGER! GO!" I was straining.. sweating.. fighting her energy..

He obeyed, but he didn't like it. He carried her out over his shoulders.

I felt all the girls press themselves to me, and push their own personal energy into my power.

Gaea: "YOU CA.. CANNOT... YOU HAVE NO.. IDEA.. WHAT YOU'RE DOING!!"

K: "YES WE DO - DEFEATING YOU!"

The energy explosion that hit us, blew out the back wall, and detonated the vines in the room. We had the feeling of being knocked back by them - but, this time, I was not knocked cold. I felt my wife around me.. my friends.. cushioned.. protected.

As the air cleared, Gaea was gone. The seven Geodes floated there. Each one a different color.

They then floated over to us. One by one, the Geodes found an owner. Yellow to Fluttershy. Sky Blue to Dash. Orange to Applejack. Red to Sunset. Green to Toola Roola. White to Rarity.

And to me.. a swirling, rainbow hued Geode.

We reached out and touched them. In an instant, they bound themselves to us. Each of the Geodes formed a pendant of the respective girls' Cutie Marks. But, for me? A rainbow heart.

I could hear Galactica's voice..

"YOU unite them.. YOU bring them together.."

Everything was still for a moment. And I realized we were floating. The energy dissepated, and we gently landed on the ground.

Everything was still.

Then, the vines quickly withered away.. and the shaking of the building intensified.

Rarity: "NOT TO ALARM ANYONE, DARLINGS, BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN GET BACK TO THE FIRST FLOOR!" She screeched, measuredly.

I heard the roar of an engine, right then - and the blown out section of the wall was soon filled with a sight I never thought I'd see - a HELICOPTER! With Equestrian markings!

Bright Eyes: "EVERYONE IN, QUICK!!" She yelled.

We all ran, jumped, and climbed into the cabin - there was just enough room for all of us.

Bright Eyes: "HANG ON!" She wheeled the control stick over, and got us away from the building.

The hotel collapsed behind us.

But, we were safe.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Daisy Glory

TIME: 10:54 Central European Time
DATE: War Day 1009, 7 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Marenaco Gendarmes Headquarters, Principality of Marenaco


We were seated in the Gendarmes HQ's ready room. Doc Allcome was looking at Gloriosa. Everyone was a bit stunned.

Sky Stinger finally came into the room, and just plopped to his haunches.

Aria: "Sky..?" She slid over to him, and put her wing around him. "You okay?"

Sky Stinger: "My dad's dead. I-I mean.. we weren't close.. but.." He frowned.. scowled.. then started sobbing again.

Aria cuddled him clcose to her, and used her Siren magic to gently sing into his ear to relax him. He slid into her forelegs, and just hugged her.

Dusk: "You didn't get a chance to make it right with him." He paced over and put a hoof on his shoulder. "Believe me, I understand."

Brindle Spindle came into the room right afterwards. He looked to Dusk, and nodded to him. Trixie was at Bridle's side.

K: "I'm guessing you knew Sky's father?" I said, softly.

Brindle: "I did. Most of us wealthy ponies kinda know each other to some extent - you could say, we graze the same fields.. K." He paused before just addressing me by name. "Sky. If you or Lightly need anything, you don't hesitate to tell me, okay?" He lowered himself next to Sky.

Dusk: "Dad." He nodded. "I was just telling Sky that.." He ducked his head. "..he wasn't as lucky as us."

Brindle: "Yeah." He nodded, clearing his throat. "Every day that goes by in this war, I realize how foolish I was." He looked up to his son. "I'm glad we made peace."

Dusk: "So am I." He nodded back.

Trixie: "Your dad knows you proposed, by the way." She was haughty, but very quiet about it - she was sensitive enough to know that Sky needed comfort, not out of place bitchiness.

Sky: "Thank you, Mister Spindle." He nodded a bit, still hugging into Aria.

Aria: "I'm Aria." She nodded to Brindle. "I'm.. Sky's marefriend." She had to think about the right word to use. "I love him.. I love him so very much." She held him close to her. "I just want to eat up all his pain and leave him with only joy."

Brindle: "Hmm! True love, then." He smiled.

Sacquet came in, about then, and nodded to me.

Sacquet: "Mon ami?" He said softly. "She asks for her brother." He shrugged a tiny bit. "Zee prince, he is.. very unhappy. She must answer for this."

K: "Right." I nodded. "Come on, honey."

Timber: "Is.. is she okay?" He blinked at Sacquet.

Sacquet: "Oui. Yes. She will phyiscally recover, says Doctor Allcome." He nodded, and led the way.

We made our way to the Gendarmes Medical Room. The entire Headquarters was part of the Palace grounds, and attached to the Royal Palace itself. The Prince was here, with his Guards. The Prince was wearing his combat uniform - while highly embellished and colorful, I noted that he had both a sword and a Châtellerault P1 pistol in a combat holster.

Prince Vouz-Tire le Levier: "Général." He nodded curtly to me.

K: "Prince Levier." I nodded back.

Dr. Allcome: "K." He stepped up to me. "She's recovered physically from the magical contamination left over by Gaea, when she transformed." He shrugged a bit.

Prince Levier: "So, she is healthy enough to be put in prison before trial?" He asked, very direct.

Dr. Allcome: "I suppose so. I would far rather she simply be detained in a hospital, in case there are complications." He looked right at me, as if to say 'Do we really need to do this?'

K: "What charges do you want to level at her, Prince Levier?" I asked, looking down.

Prince Levier: "33 counts of murder, a count of terrorism, and at least 14 counts of destruction of propertie." He scowled. "Were she not an Equestrian citizen, I would ask she face ze Guillotine!"

Timber: "YOU CAN'T DO THAT!" He shouted, and Applejack had to hold him back.

Applejack: "TIMBER! HALT THAT WAGON TRAIN!" She jerked him back.

Prince Levier: "What would you have me do!?" He shouted back at Timber. "She murdered 33 people! She destroyed our race track and many buildings, ruining the lives of many of my ponies! She ATTACKED my COUNTRY!" He leaned in. "AM I to stand BY and let ZIS HAPPEN wis'out SOME KIND OF ANSWER!?" He waved his foreleg. "The families of my citizens and others, zey will demand JUSTICE!"

Timber: "She's a victim, too." He stated. "Whatever happened here, this was Gaea's doing. YES.. my.. sister.. she.. she somehow found the Gaea Geodes, but.." He shook his head. "I can't imagine she'd ever want to do anything like this willingly. MY SISTER. Sir. Your Highness." He waved a foreleg.

K: "..since this wasn't Tirek's doing, as far as we can tell, then this isn't a NEIGHTO matter." I looked at Timber. "I'll talk with Celestia." And back to Prince Levier. "You're essentially asking that Equestria imprison her for life." I shrugged. "As Commander in Chief of Equestria's military - which includes the Gendarmes that run the prisons - I may not have a voice in the justice itself, but I have a voice in her punishment."

Prince Levier: "Oui." He nodded a tiny bit.

Chemical Lens: "Prince Levier." She paced in behind me. "I have heard the conversation, and analyzed the battle itself." She stepped up to him. "Sheriff Chemical Lens, Your Highness. Special Marshal of the Royal Court."

Prince Levier: "Sher-eeve." He nodded to her.

Chemical Lens: "What we are attemting to determine is Gloriosa's level of culpability. As the Gaea Geodes have transformed and changed into something else, I am unable to analyze them. However, from the witness reports - including the Elements of Harmony - I can and will testify that she was not in control of her faculties and her own body during the entire attack." She shrugged a bit, and handed over a very thick folder. "I am an expert in Criminology and Forensics - your own pre-war Gendarmes retained me twice for critical investigations, and will attest to my credibility." She was in Full Analyst Mode. "I believe my testimony would be humiliating to your prosecution. And would depict these charges as retaliatory and vengeful in nature - not in the interests of Justice for Justice's sake, but using Justice as a sword for revenge. Prince." Her delivery was emotionless, robotic, and disassociated.

Prince Levier: "..which would lead to scandal." He frowned and looked down at the ground. "Général. What would you have me do?"

K: "She has to be punished for initiating the chain of events, but the exact crimes done to your people was done by the Spirit of Gaea. Not Gloriosa Daisy. She was a puppet. After Gaea was done avenging herself on Sky Stinger's father, she was going to start a Race War between the Earth, Pegasi, and Unicorn ponies. THAT.. that cannot become public knowledge. We JUST dealt with some of the Unicorn Supremacists in Ambleon. We can't have more of this coming out." I shrugged. "Charge her with Misuse of Magic and Defilement of Magical Artifacts. That carries a sentence of 5 years each, or removal of one's magical power. In addition, legally expel her from Marenaco and forbid her from re-entry. As Marenaco is in Dynastic Union with Prance, this would extend to Prance and Quirtbeck, and any Prench possessions." I shrugged.

Prince Levier: "...mm.." He lowered his head in thought. "I will agree to these terms." He nodded. "What punishment will Equestria keep her under?"

K: "Simple. Ten years of community service." I smiled just a bit, lowering my head, and looking at Timber. "Imprisonment is pointless - she knows what she did was wrong, correct, Doctor?" I looked at Cody.

Dr. Allcome: "Yes, very much so." He shrugged.

K: "Then confinement is inappropriate." I shrugged. "Confinement is for unrepentant sinners. She has repented. Instead of loss of freedom, she should spend the next ten years teaching the younger generations the values of Friendship. Service to repay for her crimes. And probation for life." I nodded. "After this war is over, should her brother survive, I'm certain he would agree to look after her and keep her on the straight and narrow." I nodded to Timber. "Right, Ranger?"

He relaxed in Applejack's grip, then brushed himself off and stood to attention, saluting me and Prince Levier.

Timber: "My loyalty to Equestria and the Princesses, until my death in their service." He nodded firmly.

Prince Levier saluted him.

Prince Levier: "Then it is settled." He nodded. "The trial will be held as soon as she is fully recovered."

Timber: "Thank you, Prince Levier." He bowed slightly to him, as he dropped his salute.

Prince Levier: "Truly, if it were Escargot in this same situation, I cannot say I would not react the same. We may not be as close as you two surely are, but my love for her is absolute." He nodded, and finally, smiled.

Justice would be served. Properly.
