Part 1: Resolution

LOCATION: Everfree Forest
DATE: War Day 2/6 Quartus 1002 C.S.
TIME: 17:27 ERST

I was on my back, on a stretcher. Mac was carrying the front, and Applejack on the rear. The Wonderbolts had airlifted Twilight out just a few moments before. I was in and out of consciousness.. it was the magic. I'd fade into blue-white light, and back into reality. Alongside my stretcher was Spitfire (who's ribs were now hurting her too much to fly), Pinkamena (not Pinkie right now), Rarity, Soarin and Cherry Coke. Applejack was worried about me..

AJ: "..take these silly risks, yer-yer not gonna come back one of these days!"

K: *Ngh* "I'll always come back.." I poked her with my right foot, in the snout.

AJ: *Desperate whisper* "Twilight.."

K: "I know.." I lowered my head. "I-I don't know how bad it is.. I could't stop her.."

PDP: *Darkly* "..she should have been more careful." She said as she walked by me.

Spike: *Sobbing* "This is my fault!" He said, being led towards Headquarters by Fluttershy.

K: "SPIKE! No! Come here." I bid the baby dragon to me, and hugged him, picking him up and holding him close. "No, Spike.. this isn't your fault. Never, ever blame yourself for what happens on the battlefield.. this shouldn't be happening anyway, and you shouldn't even BE here.."

Spike: *Sobbing* "She's all I've ever had!" He buried his snout in my chest. All I could do was stroke the back of his head.

Fluttershy: "Uh.. K.. how's your hip..?" She nodded gently to me.

K: "Hurts like hades.. I've never felt pain like this before. I'm just glad, as a mammal, my internal organs are pretty much the same as yours. I'd be boned hard if you were all lizards or something." I grunted.

Rarity: "What do we do, now?" She didn't seem to care that there was mud in her hair.

K: "We get ready for whatever comes next. One thing we must absolutely not do is let this war disrupt our lives. If we jump at every shadow and act like shut-ins, Tirek's won one hell of a victory - over our Morale, over our lives. We can't give him that. Ever." I shook my head.

Dash: "He's right! We can't let Tirek think he's got us whipped!" She went over to Pinkamena, and grabbed her. Pinkamena looked ready to stab her for it. "PINKIE! I wanna throw a victory party!" Applejack, Spitfire, and.. just about everyone looked at her like she'd just descended from Mars.

PDP: "...what's the point?" She hung her head. From Murderous Pinkamena to Sad Pinkamena.

K: "Because we won?" I shrugged.

PDP: "But.. Twilight.. the others.." She just held her head low.

K: "I know the ponies we lost today.. they're good ponies. They would want a party. Death isn't.. it's not something you grieve over. It shouldn't be, even though it is. No.. the time of a person's death is when you celebrate the life of the person that's fallen. Death is what makes life worth living. Have any of you stopped to think what it must be like for Celestia?" They looked at me like I'm stupid. No, they hadn't. "She's.. from what I can tell.. basically nearly immortal, or at the very least, she's just now hitting her prime. And think about it - she sentenced her sister to imprisonment on the moon a thousand years ago. What's life like for her? She's been around.. how long?"

They looked at me like a blasphemer. I wasn't surprised.

K: *sigh* "Our lives are but a speck in her life. She'll remember what happened here, but over time, the memories will fade. Two thousand years from now, she might remember us if she has photographs of us still around. Five thousand? Who's to say? Death is what gives all lives closure, and because we're mortal, we have the advantage that our short lives are filled with memories, and if we're really lucky, we don't lose those memories as we get older, and when our time comes, we have all of them, that we remember, in that split second before life leaves us." I rolled over on my back. "That's what we celebrate. The memories. The fun we had with them. How good their friendship was in our lives. Death isn't something to chase after, but when it comes, it should be a celebration of life. Grieving saved for the day of their burial." *Sigh* I petted Spike. "Remember the good times. That's what you should do. Party hard - our dead friends would want it that way." I leaned up a little, using my back muscles, not my hip ones. "Applejack?"

AJ: "Yes, Honeybun?" She put a hoof gently on my shoulder.

K: "Promise me that.. if I -don't- make it back from this war, that you throw the biggest party Equestria has ever seen, for me. I know I want to be remembered for all the happy times we've all had together. Not the bad ones. I made my wife promise me the same thing. I want cider flowing like rivers, dozens of cakes and every sweet tasty treat the two of you-" I looked at Pinkamina.. there was a spark there, I was talking about a party. "-can make. I want everyone there. I want laughter, dancing, fireworks, stories of awesome. Got me?"

AJ: "A-Alright.." She was very saddened by this idea.

K: "Pinkie?" She didn't answer. Her lip was quivering. "Pinkieee..?" I teasingly called. "I want to throw a party, too."

PDP: *Mrf!* Her eye twitched.

K: "I want cake.. delicious cake.. and your favourite cupcakes.. and balloons.. and streamers.. and confetti.."

PDP: *MRF!* Both eyes twitched.

Dash: "And music.. and dancing.. and friends!"

Spike: "And MORE cake!"

Pinkie: *POP* "AAAAAAAAHHH! OKAY! OKAY! You're so twisting my LEG here!" She giggled and started hopping off. "VICTORY PARTY!!"

We got back to Headquarters - I knew Berry Punch had been killed, and I suspected a couple others. The Butcher's Bill was hefty alright. Four dead in the battle - Berry Punch, Icy Drop, Streaks, and Felix. I saw their bodies lined up outside the Barn. I'd never really.. been too serious about my own faith, but I prayed right then.. I prayed for them, not myself. I didn't know who to pray TO, though.. MY God? Celestia? Luna? I just prayed 'to whom it may concern.' I think that was universal enough. I prayed for their families, their souls, their friends.. that this war could end soon, so I wouldn't have to bury any more friends. It's true what they say - there are no Atheists in foxholes. You look for guidance.. any kind of guidance.. anything from someone On High, to tell you what you're doing is right. I wondered.. did Generals pray more than Privates?

Then we got the news about Twilight.

Doctor Well Wishes came out of the barn with a couple of nurses I'd not seen before, taking in the wounded. He walked right up to me.. his voice reminded me of a cynical Alan Alda - I think I deserved that, Karmically (I hate Alan Alda when he's preachy).

Dr. Well Wishes: "Well, she got messed up really good.." He said, with barely a moment for me to register that he was talking to me.

K: "Uh.. yes. How bad?" I looked to him.

Dr. Well Wishes: "The blade penetrated her neck. She got lucky, though, it went in one of maybe three angles where it wouldn't sever her spine, her trachea, or any of the major blood vessels. Damaged her muscles, though. She's going to need time to recover." He stared at me like he expected me to poof into a cloud of dust or something, and just.. go away.

Everyone sighed in relief. I felt like I was going to have a heart attack from it.

K: "Oh, thank God.. and Celestia.. and Luna.. and Buddha.. and.. everyone.." I couldn't think of any others offhand.

Dr. Well Wishes: "Now, let's have a look at you! My best customer, over here." He didn't like me, I could see that. His very attitude - cavalier to my presence, and suffering - told me he hated the very concept of this war, and probably thought that if I went away, it would all go away.

K: "Careful, Doc." I said, in an even tone.

Dr. Well Wishes: "I'll be careful! I have an -oath- to uphold."
He spat that out with disgust.

I was pissed. I grabbed his little white coat and pulled him close to me, narrowing my eyes at him.

K: "Get Dr. Allcome. I don't want you working on me. I don't trust you." I saw Applejack glare at him.

Dr. Well Wishes: "Fine!" *Huff-whinny* He stomped off.

K: "I don't care if I'm dying, I never want that man working on me." I laid back.

Spike: "What's HIS problem?"

K: "I think.. he thinks that if I was dead or crippled or something, this war would just go away. It doesn't work like that, and sadly, a lot of people think that if you remove a single object from the equation, you can end the problem. You can't. Conflict can't be solved by ending one cause. And in conflict like this, you can't just end it by killing one person. No, if I died right now, Tirek would probably win."

Dr. Allcome came over.. he was very different from Well Wishes. He was nervous, kindly, with a good bedside manner. He patted my head gently.

K: "Good to see you, Doctor." I nodded to him.

Dr. Allcome: "Of-of course, K. It's.. it's always nice to see you."

The days Gilda was laid up, I was over at the hospital in Manehattan constantly. I ended up learning how to play poker from Dr. Allcome, of all things, while Gilda was sleeping.

K: "I seem to have taken a knife to the hip." I looked down at it. It was quite decorative. My face went to one of concern. "Do me a favour, Doc.. have someone versed in checking such things, see if Trixie put some kind of a curse or something on this, before you just up and pull it out, alright?"

Dr. Allcome: "O-Oh, of course, K. I-I was thinking the same thing. That Trixie is-"

K: "-was-"

Dr. Allcome: "-a mean ol' filly."

I had no idea just how close a friend he'd be.


LOCATION: Ponyville Hospital
TIME: 22:39 ERST

Several hours of poking and prodding later, the knife was out. It hadn't gone very deep. Economies of Scale worked in my favour here, the blade was only about three inches/76mm long. The angle it went in at, though, is what got me. If it had gone much deeper, I would have been walking with a limp for the rest of my life. I was right about the curse, though - Trixie had the blade filled with some dark energy. Most likely shadow magic. Something for her to use on Twilight Sparkle, I assumed. They couldn't identify it properly, but there was something about soul stealing in there - VERY restricted dark magic. How she'd learned it, I could only guess - Tirek. For her little revenge plot.

I was laying in the Ponyville Hospital, still, while they finished up examining the knife, to make absolutely sure it didn't leave something behind in me. Dr. Allcome still recommended that Celestia herself check me out. That's when we got word - she'd be okay. Applejack came in to see me.

AJ: "Honeybun?" She paced into the room.

K: "Right here, my dear." I stretched a bit.

AJ: "Y'all had me worried!" She came over and hugged on me.

K: "Yeah.. Doc says no Horsey Fun Times for a week." I smirked.

AJ: *Giggle* "Is that all you can think of?" She blushed, though.

K: "With such a pretty lady in my corner, can you blame me?" I shrugged.

AJ: *GIGGLE!!* "Aww.. shucks.." She turned beet red.

K: "How's the party planning coming?" I shrugged, changing subjects.

AJ: "Pinkie's back to her old self again, alright. She's going all out for this. We're gonna start it as soon as yer outta here!" I could see the gleam in her eye.

K: "Oh, don't hold it up for my sake." I smirked.

AJ: "Uh.. Mac and I went back to the farm.. and we made you this." She batted her eyes a bit at me.

She pulled out a long box with a ribbon on it. I recognised Applebloom's handwriting on it - "GET WELL SOON" with hearts and apples all over it. I took the box and opened it.. it was a gorgeous black walking stick with a globe held in an Eagle's claw on the top.

K: "All this in a few hours?" I cocked a brow.

AJ: "Well.. uhm.. actually.. the head o' it was bein' made for somethin' else.. fer yer birthday.." She blushed again.

K: "My birthday..?" Oh, what's this?

AJ: "You said it's in the fall, right?" She tilted her head.

K: "Yeah.. before.. uh.. Nightmare Night. About a month before." I didn't realize I was actually way off - I was going by the idea that Nightmare Night was exactly equal to Halloween in calendar placement, which it most certainly was not.

AJ: "Well, we kinda missed it last year, didn't we?" She nudged me a bit.

K: "Oh, God.. we did, didn't we?" Since I hadn't brought it up, or even thought about it, it just slipped by in all the training and preparations..

AJ: "May as well have it now, hon. And yes, I told Pinkie." She beamed a grin.

K: "You're terrible!" I smirked.

AJ: "Yeah, ah know!" She kissed me on the lips. Her soft, soft lips..

K: "So.. what was this for?" I looked at the cane.

AJ: "Uh.. we was gonna make it into a statue for ya." She indicated the claw-head.

K: "Oh! Where'd the cane come from?" I caressed the fine.. wood?

AJ: "We got it outta Trixie's stuff, from her wagon." She grinned.

K: "Did you get any Intel from it, too?" Thinking like a leader, as I was, it was on my mind.

AJ: "Yeah - and you were right, that was all she had. All the flyin' Raptorians skeedaddled back to Tirek's territory." Or, so it seemed.

K: "Well! At least I have something-"

AJ: "There's somethin' special about it!" Her voice was sing-songy.

K: "Oh?" I cocked a brow at her.

AJ: "Try pressin' that there knob on the shaft, there, partner."

I did, and the head popped out as if spring-loaded. Pulling the head free of the shaft of the cane revealed a rapier-like blade. Sharp as a razor, and with a thick spine, giving it a vaguely cruciform profile. I gave it a few swings, grasping the 'arm' of the Eagle Claw, letting the globe act as the pommel. A Cane Sword! I'd always wanted one of these.

K: "I LOVE IT!" I hugged her. Tightly. She was always thinking of me..

Dr. Allcome came in right after that. He looked happy enough.

Dr. Allcome: "Uh, you're free to go. Everything turned up negative. Just be careful, alright?" He was peeking over the top of a chart.. kinda cutely, really, with his shyness.

He offered me a pony-sized crutch.

K: "Thanks, Doc." I showed him the walking stick. "Got it covered." With that, we were off to Twilight's room.

Her injuries, while pretty serious, weren't life-threatening. We came in, me favoring the walking stick, Applejack next to me. Twilight's eye lit up like bonfires seeing us.

Twilight: "Applejack! K!" She winced. Talking hurt, of course, she just got a knife in the neck.

K: "Twi. Feeling better?" She nodded. "Princess Celestia is going to be alright. I asked that your brother oversee her protection for the time being." Again, a nod, with a smile. "We're having a party, you know." She nodded once more. "Think you can come?" She shrugged. "I'll ask."

And I went to find Dr. Allcome. He was in the main area - they didn't have Nurse's Stations like on Earth, but more of a central office for all the medical staff.

K: "Doc, can I spring Twilight for a few hours?" I said, leaning on the cane.

Dr. Allcome: "Uh.. well.. okay, but she should have proper medical care." He shrugged.

K: "Okay, it's settled. You're coming with." I nodded firmly.

Dr. Allcome: "M-Me!?" He was stunned, even blushed a bit.

K: "Yup. Pinkie's throwing a party." I beamed a grin of my own.

Dr. Allcome: "O-Oh, I don't know a-"

K: "No arguments, this is a Pinkie Pie Party." I cut him off.

Dr. Allcome: "Alright.. let me get a few things, and I'll be right with you." He seemed resigned to his fate.

Back to Twilight's room I went. I was getting used to the cane, it felt right in my hands.

K: "Doc says you can go for a few hours. Come on, out of bed, you." I nodded to her.

Twilight: *Croakingly* "Thanks!"

I kissed her horn. Just.. because it seemed right. She blushed.

K: "It's a Pinkie Pie Party. I'm really excited!" I beamed, cheerfully.


LOCATION: Sweet Apple Acres Barn
TIME: 23:04 ERST

The old barn.. the workshop stuff had been packed away, and everyone was inside already. A little late for a party, but it was a Pinkie Pie Party. Dr. Allcome was nervous as anything - I don't think he'd ever felt the magic of a happy party before. Not like this. And when we opened the door, everyone cheered. It wasn't just for me, it was for Twi, too. And it filled my heart with warmth. Everyone came over and greeted us - the Milita and Rangers were all in uniform, so were the Wonderbolts. Everyone else was.. well, as naked as they ever are. Not that it bugged me anymore.

Pinkie: "ALRIGHT! EVERYONE'S HERE! HIT IT, LADIES!"

Octavia: "One-a, two-a, three!" *Band plays*

ALL: "HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY! TODAY'S YOUR SPECIAL DAY! IT'S YOUR HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY, THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TO PLAY!"

Pinkie: *HAY!*

ALL: "IT'S YOUR HAPPY BIRTHDAY, TODAY'S A SPECIAL DAY! FOR YOUR HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY, AND WE'RE ALL HERE TO SAY-"

Pinkie: *HAY!*

ALL: "ALL YOUR SPECIAL WISHES, YOU WILL HAVE TODAY! HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE TODAY!"

Pinkie: *HAY!*

Cheering and applause followed. I was grinning ten miles wide. I just.. sat down on a barrel, and let the tears flow. I'd never been so happy.. it was special. Very, very special. But at the same time, I was sad. My wife wasn't here.. my brother.. my mother.. Pinkie saw this, and came over after everyone was done cheering. Instead of some silly Pinkie Prank, she hugged me.

Pinkie: "I know you're a long way from home.. but.." She nudged me a bit.

K: "No, Pinkie.. no.. I think, I am home. In a very messed up way that.. probably only makes sense to you." I pet her mane.

Pinkie: "Then, why are you crying?" She looked concerned.

K: "Tears of joy, you little pink puff. Come here!" I embraced her and squeezed.

She squealed like a piggy. We both laughed, and I set about enjoying my special day. Or, what was left of it.

Far from my mind was the thought that the last two days had been nothing but hell. That over a hundred ponies died. That I'd lost four friends this day. No, what was on my mind was our victory. We'd won a major victory today, and deprived Tirek of his most intelligent field commander, as well as a significant amount of arms and materiel. We'd killed over a hundred of his Raptorians, and not only avenged Canterlot, we'd shown him that he couldn't take us lightly. That these ponies weren't the pushovers he thought we'd be. After a while, I called for attention..

K: *AHEM!* "CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE!"

Everyone hushed.

K: "I'd like to propose a toast - no, offer my resolution. This war isn't a war we sought, but we will finish it. We will finish it as ourselves - we will not falter, we will not fail, and we will not lose sight of who we are. We're friends, and our friendship is the greatest force in this world - it's true magic. We'll show Tirek that kindness and love, not hatred and fear, are the way of this world. Together. As one."

They cheered me. But I knew, I wasn't the star of the show.. the real stars were all of them. I was just a facilitator. I would be the one to show them how to wage war, they would be the ones to win it. When it came time to blow out my birthday candles, my only wish was for a speedy end to this war..

{End Part 1}


Part 2: Renown

LOCATION: Manehattan Memorial Polo Field
TIME: 13:22 ERST
DATE: War Day 15/19 Quartus, 1002 C.S.

I was sitting in a chair on the edge of the field. Next to me was Steadholder Ironhide of the Royal Guard. Steelhoof was his cousin, and Ironhide had been the first soldier he trained. We weren't here to watch Polo, though. I was training the Manehattan Volunteer Cavalry, commanded by Applejack's uncle, Clement Orange. His wife, Cara Cara Orange, became the unit's Quartermaster Sergeant. She was seeing to inventory at the moment. They'd had some highfalootin' fashion designer make their uniforms - royal blue shirts with vibrant red sashes. It didn't sit well with me, so I already had Rarity drawing up something more.. camouflaged for them. The girls were with me as well - I was making sure they had basic training, beyond just the ability to fire a Sherman.

Derpy was the instructor - much to Clement's dismay.

But, it was Celestia's Will that this be done, so he didn't grumble TOO much. And I deliberately selected polo players - they already had the skills to move quickly on the hoof, and deviousness, to defy their opponents and score goals - they were also all people of great social renown, which added a certain legitemacy to the Militia, that they were made up of all the people of Equestria, not just the common folk. That this army was everyone's army. I was creating a Cavalry unit, not an Infantry unit like the Ponyville Milita. The Manehattan Cavalry would be used in open ground, to close the distance with the enemy, and engage them rapidly or break their ranks, so trailing infantry forces could get in position. It amazed me how I was having to blend Napoleonic tactics with late 19th Century and World War II stuff. It was crazy, but it worked.

Clement's son, Valencio Orange, was currently at the Rifle Marksmanship bench with a few of his classmates, boasting about how they'd all be heroes. The enthuseasim, while I wish it was placed elsewhere on a less destructive activity, was welcome. It meant he was willing to listen, so he could have his chance to BE a hero. I just hoped his desire for recognition wasn't going to lead him to do stupid shit, sniffing for medals. I noticed there was a higher concentration of Stallions here than Ponyville. At least Ironhide was in good spirits - Steelhoof's body had still not been found, but he wasn't concerned about it. Instead, he was focused on the events at hand.

K: "Alright, First Troop!" I called, getting up and walking over. Time for a quick tactics lesson.

I was wearing the "nice" uniform that Rarity made for me - a black cotton duck shirt with two breast pockets (one with loops), black cargo pants mimicing the ones I'd arrived in, a black tie, and a black leather belt, with a new pair of black leather boots that came up past my ankles (it turns out, she got.. uh.. less pure requests for leather use - boots were something she could do in her sleep). That and my new cane sword. To look "official" I was wearing a pin that Twilight had gotten from Celestia some time ago, on my collar. It was a silver-and-gold sun about an inch (25mm) across. Of course, my PA-63 and my hunting knife were on my belt.

K: "Time to teach you how to be Cavalry, not Infantry. Clement?" I nodded to him.

Clement: "Yes, sir?" Though I had no official rank, I was technically the 'leader.'

K: "See those hay bales we have set up at the far end of the polo field?" I pointed to them.

Clement: "Of course." He nodded, surely.

K: "You're going to charge them. Under fire." I smirked.

Clement: "Under... FIRE?!" His eyes went wide, probably expecting live ammo.

K: "CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS!" I called out with a laugh in my voice.

Scoots: "YES!" She popped up from behind a hay bale with a rotten apple in one hoof, and a mischevious smile.

Clement: *GASP!* "Bu-but our uniforms!" He blubbered.

K: "This is why I said, they must be practical. Not parade quality. You'll just have to get them hand-laundered if you get 'killed.'" I smirked, snarikly.

Clement: "I think I'd rather be shot at!" And his tone suggested it.

K: "No, you don't." *Chortle*

AJ: "Uncle Orange! Knock it off, or I'm'a tell Granny on you!" She hissed from the sidelines.

Clement: "HEAVENS no! I'm sorry, I'll behave." He lowered his head.

K: "You better. Now, then, the key component to a cavalry charge is shock value. You have to get there FAST, and hit them HARD. I've done some research, using your niece as a test subject, and I've come up with this.." I trailed off as the gear was brought up.

I fixed the dull wooden training bayonet on his Sherman as Applejack brought over the Cavalry Rig. She placed it over her Uncle's shoulders as I secured his rifle to it.

K: "On Earth, Cavalry used Lances, up until the last active combat cavalry unit about forty years before I was born." The Polish cavalry from World War II.

K: "Instead of lances, you'll be using your Shermans. This hitch is designed to push the force of the impact back and towards your flanks. The Bayonet itself is just ahead of your jaw, so you can look and see where the blade is going to go. Once you impale something, you can use your forelegs to remove it, or trample it." I nodded.

Clement: "I just got a hooficure!" He protested, meekly.

K: "Tough. You might want to put on the Cavalry Hoofshoes.." I suggested.

Clement: "But, my Hooficure!" He whinged.

K: "PUT. ON. THE SHOES." I glared at him.

Clement: *Defeated* "Oh, alright.." He slipped on the gleaming steel hoofshoes. They came up just a bit past the fetlocks, providing some protection. "I'm ready, now what?"

K: "You and First Troop will charge the hay bales, while dodging incoming apple cores - I mean, incoming fire. You'll learn for yourselves how best to avoid it - there's no special trick to it, other than experience. I can only give you general ideas - that and tell you that human cavalry relied  mainly on speed to close the distance in a hurry, though they didn't charge straight into the best fields of fire the enemy offered, so you'll have to feel things out as you go along." I pointed, and indicated with my hand.

Clement: "How barbaric!" He winced.

K: "THAT part, I'll agree with you on, sir. But that's what warfare is - controlled barbarism. Humans are experts on it." I shrugged with one arm.

Clement: "You poor lad." He seemed genuinely sorry to hear this.. despite his upper crust attitude, he was still a Pony, and he still cared.

K: "I know that's you trying to be nice. Yes. Humanity can be filled with some nasty stuff. But there's beautiful stuff in there, too. Someone once called it 'Savage Beauty' and 'Cruel Kindness' or something like that. Now, then, First Troop Ready?" I nodded to them all.

First Troop: "READY!"

K: "On your orders, Captain Orange." I smirked, knowing the first run would be a disaster no matter what.

Clement: *Gulp* "CHAAAAAAAAAAAARGE!" There was no confidence in his order.

The First Troop was off like a shot out of a cannon. The Crusaders started heaving rotten apples and apple cores at them at a blinding pace, the apples impacting all around them as they closed the distance. One pony down.. two.. then three.. four.. five.. and Clement went down last. So much for that.

K: "Captain Clement." I addressed him as I walked over - cursed hip was still hurting me. "Your Troop has been eliminated."

Clement: "This is IMPOSSIBLE!" He sulked.

Valencio: "Father! Pish-tosh, this is child's play! Let me have a go at it, there, old top!" He pranced up, beaming with confidence.

K: *Flatly* "Okey dokey, lokey." I cocked a brow at him.

I gave him this 'is this guy serious' look as he assembled his troop. But I winced, hearing me repeat Pinkie's line like that. The pink fluff was invading my brain.

K: *AH-hem* "I mean, give it a shot, Sergeant." I nodded.

Valencio: "Let's go, lads! CHAAAAAAAAAARGE!" He cheered, gracefully.

I had to hand it to him, he did better than his father did. He managed to get his troop halfway across the field before they were all down - his father barely got out of the starting gate. After getting up, and shaking off his head, he paced over to me.

Valencio: "FANTASTIC training concept, there, my dear sir!" *Ha-HA!* "What a lark! Come on, lads! Let's give it another shot! We can do this!" He encouraged his friends.

And right then, I appreciated his enthuseasim. I gave a nod to Corporal Cheerilee.

K: "Keep them going. I haven't had lunch yet, I'll be back." My tummy was rumbling.

I put on that leather jacket Rarity had made for me - the one styled like a European motorcycle jacket - and departed. Out on the town I went, observing the sights and sounds of Manehattan. It reminded me, of course, of New York City, but a New York from the end of the 19th century. Maybe around World War I, or so. I paid my two bits for a newspaper and read it on and off as I walked in search of a cafe that fed predator species, like Griffons. And who did I end up bumping into?

*URhf!*

Gilda: "HEY! WATCH-Oh, K! Sorry." She stepped back, blushing a bit.

K: "Gilda! Good to see you, you're looking well. New feather style?" I nodded to her.

It was a bit more filled out at the back, giving her a slightly puffier looking head. It was still boyish, but more tomboyish than it was before.

Gilda: "It's been a while, K." She said warmly.

She looked like she wanted to give me a hug, so, I took the initiative (DARN PONIES MESSING WITH MY CONCEPT OF PERSONAL SPACE FOR HUGGING REASONS!). She squeaked.

Gilda: "Ihh! In public! Really!?" She wasn't actually upset, though.

K: "Yes, Gilda, in public. Problems?" I tilted my head.

Gilda: "Ah.. no. Uh.. how's Twilight?" She shuffled her forelegs, looking to change the subject.

K: "Doing better." I nodded.

Gilda: "I'm sorry about.." She trailed off.

K: "..it's okay." Then, an idea hit me! Like a ton of bricks, it hit me. "GILDA! COME WITH ME! I have an IDEA!" Screw hunger, INSPIRATION STRIKES!

A few minutes later, I was back at the Polo Field, with Gilda. Just seeing her caused Clement to recoil a little bit, but I was determined. I had an idea that might just make a difference..

K: "VALENCIO!" I waved him and Second Troop over. "Sergeant Valencio, Corporal Back Shot, Golden Slam, Ride Off, Turtle Dove, Rani? This.. is Gilda." I looked Gilda over, carefully, the idea forming in my head. "Address her as Sergeant." I said finally.

Valencio: "Sergeant?" He was confuse.

Gilda: "SERGEANT!?" She was shocked.

K: "Yes! Yes, I have an idea, here, folks. RAINBOW DASH! FLUTTERSHY! DERPY! I NEED TO BORROW YOU!" I called towards the other end of the field. The girls flew over. "Alright, Val.. can I call you Val?" He got a look in his face like he had no way of objecting. "Here's what we're going to do. Derpy? Gilda here is going to be my prototype for professional battlefield reconnaisence. I'm going to use her to form an independent flying scout force." I ignored the severe look that Dash gave Gilda as she flew up.

Gilda: "Wh-what?" She was stammering.

K: "I'm serious. That's what this army lacks - an independent scouting force. Rangers are great for light infantry tactics, and some scouting on the ground, but flying.. I'm sorry, Pegasus Ponies.. have an advantage over their grounded cousins." Dash gave a bit of a haughty look. "And next to Dash or the Wonderbolts, Gilda here is one of the best and most skilled flyers I know. Plus, as a Griffon, she understands ground maneuverability, too. Instinct - looking for easy prey and all that."

Gilda: "I.. I guess so." She shrugged.

K: "This is what we're going to do - Gilda, you take the lead of the formation. Dash, Derpy, Fluttershy, you follow close behind her.." I pointed.

Dash: "I don't know about this..!" She started to object.

Gilda: "Dash.." Her head hung. "K? Can you give me a minute?"

K: "OH! Yeah, right, sure." I nodded to a stand of trees. "Take it over there in privacy." Dash and Gilda flapped over towards the stand of trees, to, I presumed, exchange apologies. Gilda had matured and calmed down quite a bit since they'd last met. "Now, Valencio, this is what your job is - get signals from the scouting unit, so you know where the enemy force is positioned, and where you're going to take fire from.. then take the enemy position using that knowledge to minimise incoming fire."

Valencio: "So.. I can form my own game plan, so long as we get there with a quickness, yes?" He nodded, making sure.

K: "Exactly. A good cavalry charge.. well, the cavalry actually gets there and makes a breakthrough. It doesn't necessarily require you to charge headlong into the enemy's best fields of fire." I pointed at the hay bales.

Dash: *From a distance* "WHAT!?"

K: "Oh, my.." I bit my lip. Did Gilda tell her, her true feelings, or was that Dash's sense of justice getting pissed about the whole exile thing?

After about ten more minutes, Dash and Gilda came back. Both were blushing, but I couldn't tell if it was out of anger or something else. Gilda, at least, seemed at ease about everything. What surprised me was that she publicly walked up to Fluttershy and bowed her head.

Gilda: "I'm sorry, Fluttershy, for making you cry all those months ago, back in Ponyville. I was dealing with a lot of stuff then, and I know that doesn't give me an excuse, I wanted to explain why I overreacted to everything, and that.. I-I'm sorry." She rubbed her arm nervously as she spoke.

Fluttershy: "It's alright.. I forgive you." She said, fluttering near her.

Gilda: "Thanks. We cool, now?" She nodded to her.

Fluttershy: "Of course." She just smiled warmly.

K: "Dash, are-"

Dash: "We're fine!" She grew redder as she cut me off.

K: "Alright. Now, Gilda.."

I explained my concept to her. That she was going to be the leader of an independent flying scout unit - her main job on the field was to find the enemy, and direct the Equestrian troops to them, and in such a way that would catch the enemy by surprise, or at least guide them towards the enemy's weakest points or thinnest fields of fire. When combined with Cavalry, it would be her job to guide them to the best place to make a cavalry charge - either one that allowed them to catch the enemy unawares, or gave them an absolute minimum time to react.

This also added impetus to my desire for two-way radio communication, but for now, hand signals would have to do.

I re-set the training scenario, and stacked the hay bales off in a stand of trees, mimicing a bunker. I set up a couple of fakes as well. The Crusaders were instructed to "fire" as soon as they saw the "enemy." And on the other side of things, I told Gilda and the girls to find the bunker and identify its blind spots, so the Cavalry could charge and take the bunker.

Combining eras of warfare indeed. If this worked, I would have a whole new sense of Combined Arms Tactics.

Valencio: "We're ready, SUH!" He clicked his hoof shoes.

Gilda: "Ready as I'll ever be." She shrugged.

K: "Now, remember, Gilda, you only shoot if you're being shot at. Other than that, your job is your eyes." I nodded to her.

Gilda: "Got it." She made a firm nod back.

K: "Make it happen!" I gestured to the field.

And off they went. Before the advent of aircraft, drones, and all those technological wonders, Cavalry was the premier scouting force of a Napoleonic-era army, followed closely by Rangers, especially in mountainous or hilly terrain where horse cavalry had problems with fast navigation.

Here, I was re-casting Cavalry as the main shock force (one of their other traditional duties), and making flying personnel the main scouts (similar to early World War I, before planes were armed). I sat back and observed through binoculars, with Clement and Cara.

K: "Now, watch, this is how it's done." I smirked, feeling the plan melding together like popcorn and butter.

Clement: "Of course.." He was still trying to get the apple stain out of his shirt.

We watched as Gilda and the girls spotted the correct bunker, and Gilda identified the shortest possible path from cover to where the bunker was. The Crusaders barely had time to react - Valencio's Second Troop was on them that fast. Only one horse got hit with an apple (Golden Slam), and only on the front shoulder. Probably not a fatal hit.. but, either way, it worked. Better than I expected. Satisfied with my new tactic, I sat back and enjoyed the cheers from Valencio's Second Troop in their little mock victory.

Did I mention before that Gilda played a larger role in the war than I'd first thought?

This was but one instance, one training. The Appleloosa Militia, and militia units all over Equestria were trained and instructed in the coming days and weeks. Gilda's scout team filled out quickly as she found talented flyers to accompany her. The break that Tirek gave us between his surprise attack and his next offensive, gave me the breathing room I needed to build a proper army. Citizen Soldiers, backed by a professional core.

But the respite would not last forever.

[End of Part 2]


Part 3: Grow and Spread

DATE: War Day 27/1 Quintillius, 1002 C.S.
Location: Detrot

With war now at our door, I had two new weapons in mass production. The Zhukov Sub-Machine Gun and the belt-fed Pershing General Purpose Machine Gun. As mentioned before, Zhukov SMG's were essentially Sten Sub-Machine Guns chambered for 9x18mm. They were cheap, easy to make from common pipe and tubing, and could be assembled in workshops. In fact, "Zhukov Kits" containing the rifled barrel and specific hard-to-make trigger pieces were distributed to local Militias with specifications for the other parts needed, and instructions on how to assemble the weapons, so they COULD be made locally. This alleviated some of the strain on Equestria's budding arms industry, and allowed new Militia units to at least have SOMETHING until new Shermans could be made and delivered.

Some were still manufactured at proper Arsenals, but "Militia Zhukovs," I expected, would likely have some local modifications depending on local parts availability and quality. With all the raw materials and some basic tools, a Zhukov could be hand-assembled in less than five hours by a skilled machinist (that is, someone with the correct Cutie Mark!), or about eight hours by an inexperienced one.

By doctrine, Zhukov's were given mainly to rear echelon personnel, but they were an option for Rangers, Medics, and other non-Infantry billets.

The Pershing fired the same 9x35mm round as the Sherman, so, it made sense to base the design off of the Sherman receiver. I didn't try making a disintegrating linked belt, I stuck with making a tough cloth belt instead, like other early machine guns. The riveted cloth belt used by the Pershing was designed to be cut quickly with the bayonet if the weapon jams. Or, some ponies could simply bite through it. The Mark I was water cooled, and resembled an up-scaled Sherman in some respects. Different stock, though, and the receiver opened to allow rounds to be fed into the tray.

Now, some of this was going to be fielded.

It's not often that I get to interact with some of my other soldiers - being based out of Ponyville has its disadvantages. I travelled to Detrot, which was raising its own Militia Companies and were in training from War Day 22 to War Day 30, to review the progress that was being made.

Applejack came with me. Derpy and Lyra were the ones overseeing the training force, along with 5th Squad from Ponyville and 2nd Troop from the Manehattan Cavalry.

Those ponies, I knew.

I arrived on the third day of their training, and was scheduled to remain to watch the FTX that would conclude the class.

The Detrot Militia was also going to be the first unit raised with an organic Machine Gun Squad as an integral part of the force. The Pershing was going into the field.

As I sat in the (cramped, for me) train car, I was studying some of the tomes Lyra had given me some time ago. My cane sat next to me, my fiancee across from me (in uniform). I was also thinking, at the same time, how I would organize and field a force larger than a company. I was still trying to perfect a field radio that could be used by ponies. It was weighing on me that I couldn't get this one down.

Of course, radio equipment was not one of my skills, so, the delays might be understandable.

AJ: "What'cha thinkin' 'bout, Honeybun?" She looked up to me, from looking out the window.

K: "Lots of things." I looked up. "Of course, every time I look up at you, I think of about ten more things."

AJ: "Ah-haw! Yer jus' sayin' that." She blushed.

K: "I mean it, and you know it." I winked at her.

She giggled in response.

The train ride took two days. The sleeping bunks were.. very cramped. I mean, beyond "snuggle space" cramped, I honestly couldn't sleep in one - the "box" was about five feet long. A bit less once the moulding and mattress size are taken into account. The height was what really got me, though. I was almost claustrophobic when I tried to lay down in my assigned bunk, so, I sat in the dining car instead, and simply folded the table down and set a folded blanket on it, giving me just enough room to curl up. Given who I was, the conductors didn't bother me.

When we arrived at the station, we were greeted by two members of the Detrot Militia - Captain Norfy Loconsole of the 1st Detrot Volunteer Militia Company (Infantry), and Captain Lidless Gaze of the 2nd Detrot Volunteer Militia Company (Cavalry). Granted, they'd been officers and gentlemen by act of Celestia for precisely three days, but they looked the part. They stood at attention for me.

Norfy: "K. Captain Norfy Loconsole." He stood to attention, his tone as crisp as a winter breeze.

Gaze: "Cap'tin Lidless Gaze, suh!" A Scots accent.. well, no stranger than Lyra's Irish one..

K: "Greetings. I'm K. I.. don't exactly have an official title right now, but as you know, I'm Celestia's agent for organizing the defense of the Kingdom. This is my fiancee, Applejack, Element of Honesty." I gestured to her.

AJ: "Jus' Applejack, fellas!" She gave them both a bright grin.

Gaze: "Ro'it, then! Come along. I suppose you'll be wantin' to see th' units in action." He nodded.

Norfy: "We are a bit rusty, still, sir. Forgive us-"

K: "No, no, no need for apologies. The whole concept of violence on this scale is something entirely foreign to you guys, so.. I don't expect instant experts." I cut him off, to spare any embarassment.

Gaze: "We took't over th' Stadium fer trainin', suh. Right good little spot, she are! Bleachers make a fine observation point fer callin' th' shots." They moved ahead, leading me towards the Stadium.

K: "Makes sense. In Manehattan, we used the Polo Field." I shrugged.

I was wearing a tan trenchcoat (another Rarity creation), as the weather was.. well, it was very lightly drizzling.

AJ: "Back'n Ponyville, we just used the fields outside'a town. An' the orchard.. an' we set up a lil' house.." She smirked.

K: "Ponyville is more or less Army Headquarters in as much as I live there for the time being, and Canterlot is in ruins." I shrugged.

Gaze: "Ohh, we'll get'um back fer'at one, suh!" He sneered a bit.

Norfy: "Rest assured, we will avenge those senseless deaths." Again, cold, but with an edge to it, like cutting ice.

K: "No doubt in my mind. What're your specialties?" I nodded to them both.

Gaze: "I wuz an archery teacher b'fore the war, suh." He puffed up a bit.

Norfy: "I was a magic student. I specialize in ice magic." He was plain.

K: "Interesting. Well, it takes people from all walks of life to make an army. Back where I'm from, you'd be liable to see just about anyone wearing a uniform - rich, poor, teacher, student, business owner, delivery-person, you name it." Granted, that was mostly the case in Conscript militaries more tha All Volunteer militaries, bu still..

AJ: "Relax, fellers! We ain't here ta buck yer chops." She trotted right next to me.

K: "Were you each able to fill out your rosters?" I nodded to them.

Gaze: "No issues, suh. Full roster - with more chompin' at da bit!" He chuckled a bit.

Norfy: "I was able to recruit a full compliment, as requested. And, like Captain Gaze, I have more willing to join." His delivery was the exact opposite, very professional.

K: "I may expand the Detrot Militia to four companies, if that's the case.." I said, thoughtfully considering the possibility. "But, let's focus on getting your units trained, first, then we'll see about expansion."

We arrived at the Stadium a short while later - and it was already converted into a training field. Derpy and Lyra were each working with a seperate company - Lyra with the Cavalry company, and Derpy with the infantry. The two officers took up their positions, and I watched as they ran their companies through their basic drills. Norfy's Machine Gun Squad was performing better than expected - three Machine Gunners (big, buff stallions), three Assistant Machine Gunners (unicorns, all). Norfy pointed out the advantage of using unicorn magic to quickly get the machine guns set up. Gaze's Cavalry Company was working just fine - they had the basic scout-and-assault tactic down.

For combined operations, there was Major Scarlet Heart in charge of the entire militia. She directed the two companies in a simple exercise to assault a fortified position. As I had used the Crusaders to act as opposition, she employed children to throw rotten fruit at the assaulters. She'd even rigged up satchel packs for the Machine Gunners so they could provide "volume fire." Interesting simulation, I watched it closely. Derpy finally came over to me to report progress.

K: "Derpy. How goes it?" I nodded to her, patting her on the neck.

Derpy: "Fantastic. They're really taking to this." She beamed.

K: "Good. Any word on constructing a proper Miltia facility here?" I looked around a bit.

Derpy: "We found an old, unused Ice House.. it's got a large brick wall around it, it should be perfect." She nodded firmly.

K: "Good. Make sure anyone that owns it, is properly compensated." I wagged a finger.

Derpy: "You bet!" She nodded.

K: "Hey, Derpy.." I tapped her gently on the side of the head.

Derpy: "What?" She blinked.

K: "You see what I see?"

I pointed at Gaze, as he was getting a lesson in coordinated cavalry advances from Lyra. He was fidgeting, blushing a little, and certainly a bit distracted by Lyra's... plot.

Derpy: "Oh, that? He's had a crush on her since he saw her! He's just too chicken to admit it." She giggled.

K: "Really, now?" I looked at AJ. "Honey?"

AJ: "Yeah?" She was looking through binoculars at the Machine Gun Squad as they practised on immobile targets - also looking out for good 'plots.'

K: "Would you keep an eye on the Infantry unit? Give me an eval of their cohesiveness, not just how tight those stallion asses look?" I poked her.

AJ: *BLUSH* "Aw, ya caught me lookin'!"

K: "Not that I care if you look." I smirked and went down to the field. I literally grabbed Gaze and dragged him away from his unit. "Captain, we need to have a talk.."

Gaze: "Oi! Whut?" He was stunned, like I'd caught Applebloom stealing cookies again.

Once we were well out of earshot of his unit and Lyra, at one of the two dugouts, I relaxed a little and dove right into the subject.

K: "There are no rules against fraternizing with other Militia members, you know." I nodded to him, giving him a bit of a grin.

Gaze: "WHAT-What the blazes are ye goin' on about, man!?" He turned beet red, however.

K: "You have a crush on Lyra. And I can tell you she's most definately single, and looking to some extent." I wouldn't explain HOW I knew this..

Gaze: "I has no idea whut ye mean, suh!" He *harumpf*ed.

K: "Don't play coy with me, Captain. I'm not stupid, and I'm not as gullible as ponies are. Your denials are horrible, too." I wagged a finger at him.

Gaze: *Sheepish* "Izzit really that obvious, suh?" His ears went back a little.

K: "I've had that look in my eye more than once, and I let the chances slip by me. You want to be smooth with her? Her interest is ancient Equestrian history." I pulled out a book I'd obtained from one of my materials contractors (a gift), and handed it to him. "Here, give her this. And ask her out on a damned date, man."

Gaze: "A.. date?" He looked like a deer in the headlights.

K: "You know Detrot better than I do - she's not into the fancy-pants stuff, she's a small town girl, like Applejack is. Take her to a cafe, compliment her mane, tell her she has pretty eyes, and get her to talk about herself. That's the basic way you go about getting a girl interested in you - most girls love talking about themselves and their interests. Then, when the time is right and you get on a subject you both like, put in your view on things. Be nice to her, that goes a long way, too." I nodded.

Gaze: "Ehh.. are ye shure?" He was timid about this, and it was cute!

K: "One hundred percent. Kindness of the heart is how I ended up with Applejack. Training's almost done for the day.. go on and make your move. Show confidence. Don't act like a bumbling kid and she'll probably jump at it." I shrugged.

Gaze: "I'll giv'er a go, suh. A-and, thank you." He coughed a bit.

He seemed.. more taken aback that I'd be so intimately personal about his personal life, than embarrassed about it. I watched as he made his move, from a distance, and smiled to myself as he seemed to score on that field - she hugged him in joy, at receiving the book, and seemed enthuseastic about the idea of a date. That settled, I went back over to where Applejack was.

K: "How's the infantry looking?" I sat next to her.

AJ: "Darn good! Almost as good as Ponyville's was on Day 3." She nodded.

K: "And their captain?" I looked over that way as best I could.

AJ: "Seems'a lil' stressed 'bout this. Wound tighter than a cider press.." She trailed off.

K: "Got it. Keep an eye on the Cavalry's last lesson of the day for me, would you?" I pecked her on the cheek. She blushed. "Afterwards, I'd like to take you out to dinner."

AJ: *Dreamily* "Deal, Honeybun." She beamed.

K: *Sigh* The things I do.." I smiled to myself as I went down where Norfy was, and pulled him aside this time, to the opposite dugout.

Norfy: "Something the matter, sir?" He addressed me as a superior.

K: "You look.. tightly wound, Captain." I nodded to him.

Norfy: "Permission to speak frankly, sir?" He kinda reminded me.. of Commander Data from Star Trek.

K: "Always." I shrugged. "I'm all about honest opinions, Captain."

Norfy: "I'm not sure I'm cut out for this, sir." He nodded to me.

K: "What make you say that?" I tilted my head.

Norfy: "I'm a mage, sir. An Ice Mage. I'd do better in an all-magic unit.. I think." He was unsure, but his delivery was analytical.

K: "Remember when I said an army takes all types?" I said, a softness in my voice.

Norfy: "Yes..?" He cocked a brow.

K: "Well, an army also needs to be worried about over-specializing itself. If you have one small unit for each seperate major skill, you'd have one hell of a logistical nightmare trying to organize it all. That's why Unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth Ponies are all combined into the same units. Even specialist units, like Derpy's Rangers. You're a Captain because Scarlet Heart saw something in you worthwhile, something that told her that you could lead. Let me guess, you have really good grades, and you're a logical thinker?" I pointed to him a bit.

Norfy: "Well, yes." He nodded.

K: "Good traits - good grades mean good discipline, and a logical mind gives you a clear-cut way to conceptualize tactics. You're worried about your leadership abilities, and I can understand that, but part of being in the army is having faith in those both above and below you. Your C.O. trusts you with company command - have faith in her decision, and have faith in your own ability to lead. Treat your troops right, and they'll follow you off a cliff if you lead them there. They'll have faith in you, by the decisions you make. You make the right ones and show them that you can get them home in one piece, they'll trust your judgement." I patted his shoulder.

Norfy: "But what if I can't bring them all home, sir?" He softened his tone just a bit.

K: "I never said 'all' of them. This is war. I might not even survive it. That's.. something you'll have to accept." I gestured that hand off his shoulder.

Norfy: "The unknown.. death." A short nod.

K: "Exactly. Dealing both with the possibility of your own and those under you. And not letting it affect your ability to win an engagement." I nodded to him.

Norfy: "I think I understand, sir. Thank you." He stood up straight.

K: "No problem. Now, get back to your troops, and show them what kind of a leader you are." I nodded affirmatively to him.

Norfy: "Yes, sir!" He puffed up to a formal stance.

Off he trotted to complete the last exercise of the day. I went over to where Applejack was, and sat next to her, my arm going around her powerful shoulders. Such soft fur.. such strong arms.. I kissed her forehead, as she was rather occupied looking through the binoculars.

K: "How do they look?" I asked.

AJ: "As good as Uncle Orange was, on his third day." She lowered the binoculars, and looked to me.

K: "So, pretty good, hm?" I shrugged.

AJ: "Eyup! An' I think Gaze over there's got himself a date ta'night!" She gave me a cheeky little grin.

K: "He isn't the only one." I cocked a brow at her.

AJ: "Aw, shucks." She blushed and giggled at the same time. "Dates? We're already goin' steady."

K: "I insist. I mean, we kinda jumped into this relationship without me getting a chance to properly court you." I caressed the back of her neck.

AJ: "I ain't the courtin' kinda gal, Sugarcube." She blushed hard and looked down.

K: "I know, but I want to treat you the way I think you ought to be treated - like a princess. A rodeo princess, but a princess none the less." I smirked.

AJ: *HARD BLUSH* "Ya'll're a romantic fool, ya know that?"

K: "My other wife told me the same thing." I kissed her cheek. "Now, I have you. Come on, let's get out of here."

We went to a restaurant that specialized in apple desserts. Rabbit food on the menu, save a Chicken Celestia (Ceasar) Salad, which I ordered. Applejack ordered the special - it was some kind of smorgasboard dish with a little of everything. I ordered applejuice, she ordered a cider.

AJ: "So.. you'n J-- ever go on dates like this?" She leaned in to the table a bit.

K: "Whenever I had money." I shrugged. "I usually just made dinner, or brought something home, when I was working, and we'd eat together at home."

AJ: "Ahh." She was.. going harder on the cider than I wanted to see, but I think it was partly due to her excitement.

K: "You've never really been on a date before, have you?" I asked, leaning in a bit myself.

AJ: "... naw, I ain't cut out fer-"

K: "You deserve more." I cut her off with a compliment.

AJ: "Whut?" She blinked.

K: "You deserve to be treated like this. Treated to a night out, a romantic dinner.. more. If I wasn't just drawing cash straight from the treasury, I'd buy you something, too. I'm guessing you're not big on jewelry..?" I shook my head.

AJ: "Naw! I ain't up fer that much fancy-pants stuff." She blushed again.

K: "Well, I'd still get you something. I got my wife a cowboy hat, once." I shrugged. "I'd figure out something, trust me."

AJ: "You do seem good at givin' a girl what she likes.. I-I mean.." Another blush.

K: "You're absolutely right.. in every way you were thinking." I smirked, wolfishly.

AJ: *BLUSH* "A'so..! Dessert.. I think I'll have this super apple pie.." She brought up the menu to avoid me seeing her face almost totally red.

K: "Why not order a whole one? We'll share." I said, softly, romantically.

AJ: *Mrf* "Yer jus' tryin' to push mah buttons.." She squirmed.

K: "What's so wrong about that?" I smirked.

AJ: "If'n you want it that bad, all you gotta do is tell me.." She looked at the ground.

K: "Where's the fun in that?" I smirked again.

AJ: *Mrr* "Y'all're gettin' me disturbed!" She shifted in her seat.

K: "Good." I had a big, wolfish grin again.

I ordered the pie, a la mode. And when it arrived, we both dug in. Considering we were sitting next to each other, I guess it came as a surprise to her that I took a spoonful and offered it to her.

AJ: "I ain't a baby, ya don't gotta spoon feed me.." She trailed off, but took the bite anyway.. licking the spoon.

K: "Yeah, but it's fun watching you eat out of my hand.." I said, stealing a bite from her spoon, and sucking on it.

AJ: *Giggle* "Yer terrible!"

K: "So I'm told. Come on, let's get to the hotel, I'm bushed." Yeahh.. not totally.

Of course, I hadn't slept much in the dining car on the way over. And when we got to the hotel room, of course, my romance paid off in a very thoroughly used bed. She wasn't letting me off the hook, just because I was tired. When we went back the next day to watch the Militia practice, I could see the beginnings of a budding romance between Lyra and Gaze.. I could guess his date went well. Detrot's Militia was used the next few days to properly test some combined arms ideas I'd had, and they took to it well. I could see that this world was full of talented and intelligent ponies.. and I was very thankful for that.

Tirek, after all, wasn't going to be an easy opponent to defeat, and if we didn't, these talented ponies' lives would be destroyed.

They weren't about to let that happen.

[End of Part 3]

Part 4: Night on the Town

TIME: 14:05 ERST
DATE: War Day 31/5 Quintillius 1002, C.S.
LOCATION: Manehattan

It was a beautiful, clear night as we were arriving back from Detrot. The train stopped in Manehattan before it went on to Ponyville.. and I timed this just right. Applejack was distracted, looking over some farm equipment in a catalogue, and wasn't paying attention to the fact that I was talking to All Aboard about our luggage.

That I arranged with him to have Pinkie pick it up once the train entered Ponyville.

Suddenly, I grabbed her fetlock and yanked her out of her seat!

Applejack: "WHUT tha--!"

K: "Come along, my dear! This is our stop.." I said, ushering her out of the cabin.

Appleajack: "But, this'us Manehattan, not Ponyville!" She protested.

K: "Who said anything about Ponyville..?" I replied, slyly.

Appleajack: "What'n'Tarnation're you doin'?!" She demanded as I got her off the platform.

K: "TAXIIIIII!" I called, waiting for a horse-drawn.. uhm.. buggy.. (you know when things get strange? This was one of them) to trot up. I hefted her into the seat, and slid in next to her. "The fashion district, please." I slipped the driver an extra couple Bits. "And take the shortcuts."

Applejack: "K, what's gotten in to you?!" She asked, barely having time to get the words out before I leaned into her.. real close.

K: "I'm about to do something I've wanted to do since I first got here." I said, softly. "I know you've always had little fleeting fantasies about what it would be like to.. just experience a taste of what your Aunt and Uncle get all the time. A real taste. On your terms, not theirs. To get the flashiest parts of the glitz, the fantasy of a truly romantic evening complete with high fashion, high culture, and.." I lifted her hoof into my hands. "..your very own Prince Charming. I may not be royalty, but.. I do love you."

Her eyes were watering.. she was smiling.. and then, we were kissing. A deep, passionate kiss.. this wasn't like the date in Detrot. No, this was her fantasy - all nine yards of it. I'd cleared this with Luna and Celestia ages ago - after all, I was marketing firearms now, as part of the push to ensure ponies could defend themselves. The extra funds from that would make up for one little date... especially since I was technically working without pay.

About five minutes later, we got to the Fashion District. I got out, and assisted her in getting out. I plunked a bag of bits next to the driver..

K: "Think we could hire you two for the night?" I asked him, and the.. well, the one actually doing the pulling.

Driver's Score: "Uhm.. well.." He examined the bag, hefting it.. looking inside.. his eyes went wide. "..Trotter?"

Trotter Score: "For a payoff like that? Yes, SIR! Just name your destination! We'll be waiting for you when you get done." He shrugged. "Really, bro? A night's hire for that? You'd be crazy to turn that down.."

Driver's Score: "Alright, we're hired!" He flipped his carriage sign to "PRIVATE HIRE - NO FARES."


Private Taxi for the Night: 500 Bits


I was going to make her the prettiest pony in all of Equestria. To that end, I took her to the finest dress store in Manehattan. One of the ones Rarity dreamed about either designing for, or out-selling one day, buying out and burying like trash. One of the two.

K: "Go nuts, honey." I said, taking a seat. "Anything you want - dress, stockings, shoes, handbag, the works." I gave her a dismissive hand wave.

The look on her face was absolutely priceless - her eyes were like dinner plates, her mouth agape, her hooves gently tapping the ground.. she looked ready to explode into stars and hearts... expectation.. joy.. she turned to me..

Applejack: "ANYTHING?" She asked with a bit of a squee in her voice.

K: "Anything. Anything at all. Money is no object." I smirked, and nodded.

*SQUEEEEEE!* She was about to dive into the dresses, but paused a moment.

Applejack: "You tell Rarity or anyone whut I done here, no sex fer a MONTH!" And with that warning, she was like a tornado..

Haute tu Trot: *French Accent* "You know, monseur, you have signed zee deaths warrant of your pocket book.." She mused, as she moved to help Applejack.

K: "Worth every penny and more." I leaned back as Haute's assistant brought me tea.


TIME: 15:30 ERST

Yes, she took 90 minutes to even get close to deciding. She narrowed it to five dresses - one red, one green, one dark blue, one cream, and one black. She was trying on the black one, with Haute helping her with her hair.. honestly, and I know women hate to hear this, she looked beautiful in anything - even naked. And.. well.. these are ponies, they're at least half naked most of the time.

Applejack: "So, whut'cha think?" She asked, excitedly.

K: "Definitely the black one." I nodded. "It brings out your natural hues."

Haute: "Mmm.. though green ees more her colour.." She rubbed her chin gently with her right fetlock.

K: "Yes, that and red, but I think black gives her a more classy look." I nodded, making a hand gesture to the green and red ones. "Those, while they look good for a ball or something, aren't 'night on the town with a classy gentleman' dresses."

Haute: "Monseur makes a good point." She nodded.

Applejack: "Doesn't help is the most 'spensive." She shrugged. "Aw, I'll take it. Ring 'er up - the stockin's an' heels, too."

She had hoofcaps for her forehooves - not shoes, but more like a cross between shoes and gloves, for ponies. Her rear hooves sported a fantastic pair of low heels, that just slightly accentuated her ass when she walked. And to be honest, I was thinking about her wearing those and nothing else. But, that was for later.

K: "Next stop - beauty parlor." I smirked.

Applejack: "You don' mean a.. total makeover?!" She squealed.

Haute: "Monseur knows how to treat a lady.. even if zee lady isn't sure how she wishes to be treated herself.." She whispered to Applejack. "I don't care eef he's two-legged, you keep him, madame, or you may have problems getting him back!" She cautioned, then shot me a flirty blush.

Applejack: "Hesh! MAH STALLION!" She moved right over to the Register, and I paid.

Evening Gown: 45,000 Bits
Designer Nylons: 500 Bits
Designer Heels: 1,200 Bits
Custom-fitted Hoofcaps: 750 Bits

And to the Beauty Parlor we went - the finest in Manehattan. The one Rarity always talked about. In we went, and to her great surprise...

Rouge Blush: "Ah! Your appointment! You're a bit early.. but.." She motioned to the chairs. "Hughgo Mayne will be your Personal Stylist today, Miss Applejack."

Applejack: "Personal.. stylist..? Appointment?" She looked at me.

K: "I sent word on ahead once we got to Detrot." I shrugged. "I went by the train schedule - I figured you'd take two hours to pick a dress."

Applejack: "Honeybun.." She pulled her head back, giving me her 'come hither' look. "Y'all're the greatest." She trotted over to Hughgo's seat and plopped down. Looking up at him she simply said: "Make me the most beautiful mare in all Manehattan."

Hughgo: "Of courssse, my lady." What a lisp on THAT guy. It didn't help he gave me a look when I came in.

K: "I'll be right back, darling. I have my own appointment to attend - I can't be looking like trash when my love is a glowing beacon of beauty.. more than usual, anyhow." I smirked and trotted out the door.

Driver's Score: "Goin' somewhere?" He nodded to me.

K: "Just around the corner to the Barber's Shop." I said, digging in my briefcase and pulling out the custom leather shoulder holster that Rarity made me. I stuck my PA-63 in here, and stuck the whole thing in my trench coat pocket. "If you need lunch, now's the time - she'll be an hour, minimum."

Trotter Score: "Man, you're really going all out - isn't she from the Apple Family? Sweet Apple Acres?" He nodded towards the Parlor.

K: "Very astute, my good man. Yes. And her aunt and uncle are the Oranges." I shrugged. "This was her fantasy, I'm merely fulfilling it." They smirked, I smirked, Trotter Hoof-Bumped me as I went around the corner to the Barber's.

At the Barber's Shop, I walked on in, and got a couple of odd looks. There was a Griffon working here - Gilda knew him. Some.. distant cousin or something.

K: "Gryf? I'm here to get sexy." I smirked.

Gryf: "Oh! Right, you're the Human that helped my cousin! Come on, take a seat." He dusted off the chair.

Sitting down, I removed my trench coat, over shirt, and stripped down to my A-Frame.

K: "Need a shave - take the goatee off. My lady's complaining about the whiskers. Moustache, too. Be careful, human skin is rather thin. A bit off the sides, slick it back, please. And a touch of coalblack."

Okay, I have maybe one or two grey hairs. I'm over 30, this happens. At least I'm not going bald.

Gryf: "Hot towel, too?" He nodded to me with a grin.

K: "The works. I'm going out on the town tonight." I beamed a grin of my own.

Gryf: "Never worked on a human before..." He scratched his chin.

K: "Sides should be about half the depth of your claw, top should be one full claw. How's that?" I mused.

Gryf: "Done! Right.." Scissors came up. "Just relax. I'm a professional."


TIME: 16:00 ERST

I was looking spiffy. My hair was perfectly even-toned, slicked back. My face was baby-butt smooth, not even a nick. And I had a light pine scent going from the aftershave. What I also didn't tell her, was that I had Rarity craft me a second full tuxedo, pants and all (I had to help her with that - she kept wanting to give me short-shorts the first time). THAT, I had delivered to a package store in town, which was a short walk from the barber's. Into the store, and out I came, wearing the Tuxedo and its matching black twill trenchcoat.

Oh, and a fedora. A FEDORA, not a Trillby. Proper size. And with a silk scarf to go with it. I strode into the Beauty Salon, and I heard several gasps.. and Rogue Blush? Was burning up red-faced, with a funny little grin on her face. I looked like my roots - like a fine Chicago Gangster of the 1920's and '30s. And I didn't walk, I strode.. like I was walking on air.

K: "Ladies." I smirked.

Applejack was in Hughgo's chair, still. Mud on her face, cucumbers over the eyes.. the works.

Applejack: "Whut's goin' on!? I got cucumber on mah eyes here!" She popped them off, saw me, and I swear she turned to jelly for a minute. A dark little grin on her face and she turned to the other mares in the store. "And that's MAH STALLION!" *Snort*

They all looked positively crushed. Me? I leaned agaisnt the doorway and let the brim of my fedora lower down a little. If I had a cigarette, I'd take one out and light it, just to complete the look. Classy. As. Fuck.

Rogue: "Hmmm! Let me know if you're ever in need of a.. beauty treatment, hey?" She smirked at me.

K: "Sorry." I slid my glasses down just a bit, to look over the rim. "Spoken for." I said, wolfishly.

I could hear Applejack squirm from there.

Makeover for Her: 500 Bits + 100 Bits tip
Barber Shop for Him: 50 Bits + 10 Bits tip


TIME: 16:25 ERST

Driver and Trotter pulled back up, having grabbed a late lunch, just as Applejack finished being prettied-up. Her hair was done up, luscious curls set carefully on her head. Light touch of makeup - eyelashes plumped and lips accented. Her dress was gorgeous.. all dolled up, she looked a perfect match to my Fineries.

Applejack: "Honeybun.." *Ahem* "I must say, you look positively exquisite.." She said, putting on her Manehattan Upper Class accent. "And truly, my love, this is everything I ever dreamed."

K: "Uh-huh.. you've got to see where we're going." I pulled the tickets out. Phantomhorse of the Opera - the ROYAL Box.

Applejack: *Gasp!* "A-Are you.." *Ahem* "My dear sir.. those seats are.."

K: "By Royal permission only." I held up my personal Royal Pass. Celestia gave me one ages ago, so I could come and go at the Palace whenever I needed. "Come, my dear. Curtian is at five." I aided her into the carriage - Driver and Trotter were bug-eyed at the two of us. Such a dramatic change! And once I was in, I nodded. "Royal Manehattan Theatre." I looked at Applejack. "Take your time, some. We've a bit over half an hour."

Driver's Score: "You got it, sir!" He leaned forward. "Trotter, fix yer hair, we're drivin' a real Lady an' Gentleman here." I watched them both spiff up a little, before Trotter started trotting off like an expertly-cultured Carriage Pony.

The ride took us through Central Park - it was the best route. The sunset was magnificent.. I held Applejack's hoof in my hands as she gently rest her head on my shoulder. I could almost feel her heartbeat pounding from here. This was her Fantasy. And I figured, if I couldn't be there to do it for J--, like I'd always wanted, I would do it for Applejack, and hope J-- could feel my love from here, that she could vicariously live through Applejack...

Tickets to Phantomhorse of the Opera, Royal Box: Free, technically, since the Box is Royal Invitation Only.


TIME: 16:50 ERST

We arrived at the Theatre, and pulled right up front. I got out, and aided M'Lady out as well. She came out like a sprite - gliding perfectly to the red carpet, amongst the stunned public. Her aunt and uncle were here - I spotted them as we were pulling up. A few newsies around snapped pictures. I nodded to the crowd.

K: "Ladies.. Gentlemen.." I shot Clement a look, like 'you expected me to treat her any differently?' His return look was pride. Beaming pride.

Applejack: "My dear.. this is truly magnificent." She said, as I took her hand and walked her to the door. "It is such a pleasure to attend this show."

I could feel it in the way her fetlock gripped my palm - if we had a closet handy, our clothes would be shredded. Escorting her inside, I showed the tickets and passes - Clement looked surprised as we were escorted to the Royal Box. They had to find something larger for me to sit in, but once they did - it turned out to be one of the sofa-benches from storage - I was able to sit next to my new love. And enjoy the Pony version of Phantom of the Opera.


TIME: 20:30 ERST

The show was magnificent, the actor's voices perfectly in pitch and tune. Applejack spent most of the time entranced by the performance, and I spent most of the time entranced by her - and thankful that Rarity designed by pants with a little extra room in the right places, so my.. "attentiveness" wasn't showing for all to see, so blatantly. When the curtain closed, and the hoof-claps began, Applejack was on her feet, cheering. It was the perfect performance..

..and it wasn't but the second act to a four (five) act show. Escorting her from the theatre, I guided her into the carriage.

K: "Giancarlo's, please. We have reservations." I smirked.

Applejack: "And a five-star restaurant, as well? You spoil me, sir." *Giggle*

Driver's Score: "Oh, yes sir! Right away." And off we went.

Giancarlo's was one of the three best restaurants in all Manehattan. I picked it on purpose because they were also the only one of the three that regularly served meat... hey, I'm only human, alright? When we arrived, again, as a Gentleman, I helped her out of the carriage. Escorting her to the door, I nodded Driver and Trotter off to go get their own dinner. And in we went.

Luigi Pastrami: "Ah! Meester K, Meees Applesjack, your reserved table'a is right this way!" Yes, his name is Luigi Pastrami. His cutie mark happens to be a plate of spaghetti.

K: "Thank you, Luigi." I tipped him when we got to the table - tipping the Matre'd is going out of style these days, but.. "A bottle of wine, please. Your finest." Menus delivered, he nodded and bowed as he moved off.

Applejack: "Truly, my dear.. this evening has been exceptional." She gave me a more cultured version of her 'come hither' stare.

K: "I told you, you deserve to be treated like a princess." I said, pulling a box from my coat. "And this is a tradition where I come from..."

As the wine arrived, I got on one knee and opened the small box. Inside was a ring - now, I know what you're thinking. 'Ponies don't have fingers! Why a ring?' I had it attached to a plain silver chain, that's why. A necklace. The ring itself was silver, with a red ruby set in the center in the shape of an apple. The green stem and single leaf was emerald. Surrounding it, were small diamonds.

K: "Applejack, since I arrived here two years ago, a stranger in a strange land, you've shown me nothing but true love from your heart. And likewise, I have fallen completely in love with you. You mean the world to me.. and I would be honored if you would agree to make our union permanent - Applejack, would you marry me?" I made this speech as I carefully placed the necklace around her neck.

Applejack: "I... I..." The tears in her eyes were welled up like little waterfalls, ready to crest the edges of a dam, her face was screwed up with joy. "Oh.. yes! YES!" She hugged me. Tightly. And gently whispered into my ear "Y'all gettin' raped tonight."

K: "You can't rape the willing." I murmured back, my voice drown out by the thunderous applause of the other patrons, and the staff.

Luigi: "AH! SUCH A JOYOUS EVENING! The bottle? She is on the house! Luigi is'a filled with joy, at such a romantic sight!" He clapped extra hard. "Please'a, you need anything, you call Luigi, yes?! Yes!"

Once she was done hugging me, she leaned back and quickly touched up her eyeliner - it wasn't running THAT bad, but bad enough that she applied the quick fix to it. We then took a look at the menus.

Applejack: "Ah'll.." *Ahem* "I believe I'll have the Grand Salad.." She nodded. "..and the cross bun side." She said to Luigi, who was right there, taking our order.

K: "The.. oh, my you have Lobster here?" I asked, making sure I was reading it right.

Luigi: "SI! Fine lobster, straight'a from Baleston and Augusty.." Boston, Massachusetts and Augusta, Maine. Fascinating.

K: "Lobster. Whole thing, please. Steamed. Plenty of butter and lemon." I nodded.

Luigi: "Si, si signor!" He nodded. "AY! Mario! Step on it, eh?" He hurried off. Yes, he has a brother named Mario Pastrami. And yes, Luigi wears a green bow tie, and Mario a red one.

No, I'm not making this up, of all places, this restuarant has Mario and Luigi in them. I was a bit stunned when I put this all together, but I ignored it. As long as a ten-foot spike-shelled lizard didn't start breathing fire on our dinner, I'd be fine.

The lobster, when it came out, was fantastic. I got a blue shelled one, of all things. Apparently, they're quite common here. It was perfectly steamed. And Applejack's salad was so fresh, I swore it was still growing. Truly, we were being treated to the best. For dessert, we shared an oversized apple cobbler with creme and cherries on it. And once it came time, I tipped them VERY well.

Dinner at Giancarlo's: 2,000 Bits + 600 Bits tip.

TIME: 21:40

Applejack: "That was truly a magnificent evening.." She started as I helped her into the carriage.

K: "Who says we're done?" I looked at Driver and Trotter. "To Central Park, please. The Pavillion."

Driver's Score: "Yes, SIR! I hear there's a concert tonight.."

K: "Sure is.." Octavia and her orchestra.

Applejack: "Now what is this?" She asked, trying to stay refined and resist shredding my tuxedo right there in the carriage.

K: "Dancing, my dear." I leaned back and let her head rest on my chest. Ohhh.. she was squirming. This was truly HER magical night.


TIME: 21:55

I stepped from the carriage, and helped her out. As I did, I nodded to Driver and Trotter.

K: "Alright, guys, that's all for the night. We'll walk to our final destination from here. You guys take care of yourselves." I tipped my hat to them.

Driver's Score: "Yes, Sir! A real pleasure being your Carriage this evening!" He beamed a grin.

Trotter: "Double for me, sir, ma'am. Have a great time." He nodded to us both.

The sign was flipped to OFF DUTY and away they went. And we got there just in time - the Orchestra was just tuning up. I escorted M'Lady Applejack down to the large, flat "stone fountain" about forty meters from the stage.. it was a large, wide circular area that was some kind of modern art piece. But for tonight, it was our dance floor.

As the first movement started up, I took her in my arms. Her fetlocks in my hand, I put those dancing lessons I took in Middle School to good use, though I could barely recall all the steps. After a bit, it came back to me, though - well enough that I had her gliding across the smooth granite, in time with the beat, her head resting on my chest, her heels gently clicking along as Octavia and her group played.

We danced for over an hour - movement after movement.. our bodies as light as feathers, the stars themselves our nightlights.

It was perfect.

A fantasy.

Concert in Central Park: Free


TIME: 23:10 ERST

After an hour and change we'd decided we'd had enough. And we walked (as though walking on air) to the hotel. Yes, a five-star hotel. Applejack was shocked when we were walking into the Lobby..

Glitz Broadway: "Ah, Mister K. Your reserved suite is ready.." He held out the tag. "..room service will be there at eight, as requested."

K: "Thank you, sir." Over to the elevator..

Applejack: "Really? A suite?" She poked me.

K: "THE suite, my dear.." I grinned mischeviously.

Applejack: "THE suite..?" Her eyes bugged.


The Bridal Suite at the Manehattan Mareton: 5,000 Bits


Up we went. Top floor, all out. And right over to.. The Bridal Suite.

K: "Okay, so we're not married yet, my dear, but.." I picked her up anyway, and carried her in the door. "..I insist."

Applejack: "Mhm.." She kicked the door shut as we got clear. "..you put me down, hawt stuff, yer gettin' raped."

K: "I'm STILL not done, you know.." I smirked.

Gently carrying her to the Hot Tub, I set her down and very slowly, started unzipping her dress.. teasing her? Yes, but in such a romantic way. Dress removed, I sat her on the chair next to the Jacuzzi, and removed both heels, both hoofcaps, and slowly removed both stockings..

K: "We did just pay a small fortune for these.. I'd like to keep them for later." I said, my voice soft and tender.

Her nude, I guided her into the tub as I stripped off my tux and the rest of my clothes, folding them up neatly, and setting them aside as I slid into the tub myself.

Applejack: "You're.."

She hit the jet button and pressed herself up against me, kissing me deeply.. her tongue still tasting of the wine and salad.. and vaguely of apples. I felt her legs slide around my hips, as she positioned herself properly. My arms slid around her torso.. and I turned her, slowly, around. With me standing in the center of the hot tub - the deepest part - I pressed her against the side, right by a jet. Her face went rose as the jet shot along her most sensitve parts.. only to be followed by fingers.. my fingers.. sliding inside of her.

Applejack: *AHHhhh* "K.. I.."

K: "Just relax, my love.." I said, letting my fingers probe deeper.. letting the jet stimulate her, all over..

I could feel her vaginal walls spasm as I slid my fingers in and out, gently.. and I was just probing! Her eyes gave me the lustiest gaze of total pleasure as I increased the fingers from two to three.. and seriously started driving them into her. She liked it a little rough, usually, but I was being tender.. caring.. loving..

Applejack: *NGH!**AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!* "Ohh..." Her jaw slackened a little, those emerald greens mistied as she looked at me. "..mm. Good thing we're inna pool, honeybun.." She drooled out. "I'm'a need a towel.." *AHAH!* "..don't stop.."

..and she was just eating this up. I didn't stop - I didn't even slow down. I kept going - angling her marehood right up against the jet, that the water would shoot all over it, that it would stimulate her magical lovebutton in ways fingers just couldn't - though I probably could if I got down there and ate her out. Which, after making her spasm again, I did.. only, I lifted her to the edge of the hot tub as I did so.

My hands around her ass, I pulled her in tight. My tongue stabbed into her.. and the apple flavor was clean and strong - like drinking delicious red apple juice, directly from the fruit. And as her hooves slid down over my head, and pulled me in closer, I could practically hear her eyes loll back into her skull. The moans of passion filled the room, as her natural juices flooded my mouth.

Applejack: "H-Honeybun.." *Ngh* "..damnit, FUCK ME!" She moaned as I brought her off AGAIN (that makes four).

I pulled myself from the tub, grabbed the nearby towels, and I even made an erotic show of drying her off, before I carried her to the bed. Laying her flat, I slid myself over her. My arms sliding up behind her back, I kissed down that long neck of hers.

And really, it wasn't sex with a horse. This was sex with Applejack. The person. The physical form didn't matter - if we were two souls, we would mix together. Much like I mixed my shaft into her marehood. My firm, solid strokes pumped in and out of her soaking wet slit. Her forelegs around my torso, her throaty breaths in my ear as I pounded into her, railed her into the bed.. she kept begging for more.. not harder, not rougher, just more. And I delivered. We weren't even really there anymore - our minds were elsewhere, somewhere on the cusp of Nirvana, together, as one, as we both exploded at virtually the same instant. Sinking into each other's arms.. sleep soon followed, her fantasy absolutely completed, right down to the creamy finish.
