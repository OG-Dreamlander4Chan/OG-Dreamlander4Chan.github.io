Part 1: Thestral Thaumaturge

TIME: 10:07 EET
DATE: War Day 1045/12 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Front Line, 3km south of Piloroí, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


It was time to get the war started over here. Up until now, the 2nd Vulpesylvanian Infantry Division had been the most advanced unit in their army. They had all the true mechanized equipment, much of it was saved from destruction at the start of the war, at the train yard, just as the unit was to take delivery of them and refit.

They were largely expended not 48 hours later, blunting attacks from three different armies. As I saw over the battlefield, the enemy army WAS equipped with Herdiet light/cavalry tanks, the same ones I saw in the Herdiet Union, but with local modifications.

Now, the remaining force of the 2nd I-D was reduced to about one and a half brigades of combat troops, and almost no mechanized equipment. This was fine, as they were dug into static positions.

Now, though, I'd arrived with Luna's Guard Company. While not a terribly large force, they were Elites. And many of them combat veterans from the start of the war. So, placed properly, they could bolster defenses, and allow suffering units to withdraw in good order, one at a time.

I was among them as they were trading out thier mystical "bat armor" for combat armor. Most of them had been in ceremonial garb, protecting Luna, when I used the Sword of Rainbow's Light to call her power - thus telling her I was in immediate danger. And she'd sent them out like that. They had proper combat armor, of course, and combat uniforms, but they'd not had time to change into them before being dispatched to my rescue.

Master Guard Echo Sphinx: "Ah, Altern?" I heard her say, as she was gathering her rifle and bandoleer. "Can I just stay in my armor?"

Dusk: "..really, Echo?" He paced over. "I mean-" He looked at Altern Evening Mist (5th Platoon commander). "-you mind?"

Evening Mist: "Nah." She shrugged.

Dusk: "What's the matter, Echo?" He chuckled. "Combat armor doesn't agree with your mane?"

Echo: "Ah-well, I-I mean.." She was fidgeting with trying to get her bandolier over her shoulder.

Dusk: "That'll never work, Echo. Come on-" He grabbed the release clasp at the back of her breastplate and tugged it.

The breastplate fell away. But instead of a small magical poof that would return her to her natural pony form - whatever it might be - there was no poof.

Her wings were still bat-like, her irises a slash instead of round.

Everyone froze. Well, except me.

K: "I thought ponies didn't mind a little nudity?" I shrugged, handing her a combat helmet (that she didn't accept). "Come on, we need every hoof we can get-" I looked at Dusk. "Dusk?"

Dusk: "Oh, Echo.." He sighed. "Why didn't you ever tell me?"

Echo: "What and get chased out of Canterlot?!" She barked at him.

Dusk: "N-No!" He waved his hooves. "I-I'd never do that!" He blinked and leaned his head to the side. "..okay, no, I can't lie, the old me would have."

K: "...IS SOMEONE GOING TO EXPLAIN TO THE HUMAN? Please?!" I interjected loudly.

Evening Mist: "She's a bat." She glared at her subordinate. "A dirty, filthy, disease-ridden, mangy, mate poaching, fruit-sucking BAT!" She pointed at her. "GET OUT OF HERE!"

K: "NO YOU STAND DOWN!" I grabbed Evening Mist by her collar.

Echo started to softly cry, and shrink into a little ball.

Altern Asral Sky: "What's going on over here, 5th Platoon? We-" She saw Echo, then looked around.

I realized she, too, was still wearing her ceremonial armor.

K: "You, too, huh?" I shrugged.

Astral Sky: "..I-I was instrumental at Gloom Mountain, General! I-I, you've known me since the war STARTED, I-" She sunk to her haunches. "Please don't exile me."

I turned to Dusk Seeker, put a hand on Evening Mist's flanks, forced her to sit, and looked my friend in the face.

K: "You explain everything." I said, in a normal tone.

Dusk: "Ahgh.." *Sighh* "Thestrals are their official name. They're bats and ponies combined. Part of the reason Luna's Guard used to get a bad rap in the old days with the whole Nightmare Moon thing, was, stories of bat ponies flocking into fruit tree groves and eating everything in sight. And... and occasionally kidnapping the married mates of some farmers and.. making them into fruit bats. Or-Or invading the homes of single ponies, and kinda forcing themselves on them. Mainly female Thestrals on male ponies of other races." He shrugged, and rubbed the back of his had. "We.. actually had a purity test for Thestrals.. back in the old days.. to keep them out of the guard. We use the impression that we ARE all Thestrals as a theme.. you know, scare the enemy, instill respectful fear.. look spooky." He drooped his head. "Thestrals are pretty harshly discriminated against. It's not an official policy, but-"

Dusty Dunes: "..there's lots of them in Las Pegasus." She paced up to Echo and gave her a hug. "Good to see you, girl. Sorry the truth came out." She turned to face me. "Yeah, I was in Athens, and I just missed rolling out with them." She shrugged. "So, I stole a Nash and loaded it up and got out here."

I could just FEEL Steela over my shoulders. She slid her forelegs around me.

Steela: "We haev no problem wit' de bats in Valhalla." She smiled a bit.

Echo: "Oh, Dusty!" She sank into her forelegs and cried.

K: "I'm guessing you met her in Las Pegasus?" I gestured to Echo.

Dusty: "Yeaaah.. she has a cousin there that I used to be tight with - Lucky Roll. Now, she IS a whore, and she WILL fuck married stallions, but that's part of her job, kinda. She's a 'personality' at one of the biggest casinos there. Does everything from being a dealer at private card games, to seducing married stallions - AND mares - to get them to spend more." She smirked. "She's REALLY good.." Then cleared her throat. "But, yeah, outside of Las Pegasus and Reino, Thestrals are.. kinda banned."

K: "That ends." I nodded. "Astral, swap out someone from 4th Platoon, and keep doing so until all the Thestrals are in your unit." I nodded, and turned to Evening Mist. "And you will cease the racism. That's an order. If you can't do it, quit now, I'll give Dusk your Platoon for the time being until I find a worthy replacement."

Evening Mist: "Erfh." She glared, but lowered her head. "I am bound by my Oath to my Princess to follow your orders to the best of my ability, General." And shook it. "I.. am in a combat zone, as well. I am needed. I will not fail you." She looked at Dusk. "Or you. Sir."

Dusk: "All I can ask for, Evie." He shrugged.

This was Dusk's old unit. He knew each one of them. They were his friends. Especially the other officers. If he says it's okay, then I would trust him at his word.

K: "Alright. Enough lollygagging. Get your gear on, Guards, we have work to do." I nodded, and after getting out from under Steela's huge forelegs, went over to the APC that Dusty had 'liberated' from another unit, with her.

Of course, I was immediately grabbed from above, shoved from below by Steela, and tossed into the back.

Dusk saw this, and just laughed.

Dusk: "I'LL COVER FOR YOU, SIR, BUT MAKE IT QUICK!" And almost folded in half, belly laughing.

Rarity: "Come come, now, my darling." I heard her say. "We have to get the Guards set up. Our dear General is busy with a strategy meeting. Something about.. dividing the left and right flanks?" She giggled.

Applejack: *Lustful* "Darn straight, honeybun. Dusty, git his pants off. We gots 20 minutes."

Ah.. my wife.


TIME: 10:37 EET


Exiting out the back of the APC, and getting my gun belt back on, I had a bit of a spring in my step. The two mares that dragged themselves out behind me, immediately went for the nearest coffee pot, and some apples.

They.. ah.. needed the energy.

I went over to 4th Platoon's position, as they were preparing to take the field.

K: "Astral." I nodded to her.

Astral Sky: "G-General." She was still a bit nervous.

I gave her a hug. A big, warm, friendly hug. She returned it.

Astral Sky: "I am sorry, sir." She nodded to me.

K: "No 'sir' stuff." I nodded back. "Just K. We're friends." I looked at Echo. "Echo."

Echo Sphinx: "S-Sir." She was nervous, too.

K: "I had a delightful idea." I smirked.

Astral Sky: "Yes, K?" She tilted her head, getting her brain back into the game.

K: "I'm holding 4th Platoon back until nightfall. Then, I want you to execute a raid mission." I said, looking at the other members. "And I want you to put on a BIG display of being Thestrals." I smirked. "Psychological warfare. Make sure you leave some of them alive, just greviously wounded." I shrugged. "I don't suppose any of you actually bite or suck blood?"

Echo Sphinx: "We.. uhm.. you can't become a Thestral unless you're born as one from two pure Thestral parents. Sir." She shrugged a bit.

K: "Okay. If you can stomach it, I do want you to bite a few of them. I want them to literally piss their pants that we're fielding literal monsters. Your race has an undeserved reputation for terror and evil - and I want to inflict that on the enemy. I want them scared, and I want you to see that reputation not as a hindrance, but a strength." I gestured to them.

Astral Sky: "Hm." She shrugged. "I suppose in the duty of Her Highness, one could be doing WORSE things in this war." She nodded, though. "You do have a point, though. We have a strength nopony else does. We should use it for our friends."

Dusk had trotted over while I was explaining my plan, and put a hoof on Astral's shoulder.

Dusk: "4th was my platoon before I got promoted to Training and Planning Staff Officer. If anyone's going to take up the mantle, I want 4th Platoon to be THE MOST elite, MOST feared, MOST dreaded weapon in Equestria's arsenal. Because, sometimes, just the threat of the right kind of force, can prevent a fight before it starts." He nodded to me. "Like what K did on the border a couple years ago."

K: "Exactly." I nodded. "I'll go with you, but I'll hang back, so the whole raid is done by you."

Astral Sky: "Sounds good, K." She nodded. "What do we do until then?"

K: "1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th Platoons will move in and relieve sections of the line." I nodded.

Dusk: "Athens is sending a scrap battalion. Mixed. Some Equestrian Navy, some extra Marines, some CAG personnel that were in Athens, and a company of Athens Militia. They have the 1st Division almost entirely withdrawn from the field to rearm and re-equip. 2nd is holding the line. Roaman forces have pushed from Dalmatia along the coast with Shquiptaria and pressured their rear, but it's just a probe. Ambleonian Marines will be here tomorrow, along with a Royal Guards Battalion - Ironish, Manx, Scots Guards - and the lead brigade of the 4th Infantry Division." He nodded. "Help's coming, we just have to hold a few days."

At least now, we had a plan. We just had to hold out until the plan got into motion.

That Night Raid was next.

[End of Part 1]

Part 2: Thestrals in the Night

TIME: 00:00 EET
DATE: War Day 1046/13 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Front Lines, 1km south of Piloroí, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


I was with 4th Platoon, as was Steela and Dusk. Part of our scrap battalion had arrived in the afternoon. Largely crew from the Buffalo and Marechester, organized into Naval Infantry, with two squads of Marines to fill out the roster for one Regiment.

The second Regiment was made up of Vulpine Reservists, Germane Marinekampftruppe that were assigned to the fleet and not in proper units, and one Troop of Roaman scout cavalry, led/assisted by several members of CAG. They arrived about an hour after the 1st Regiment did, with several Nash AAA Gun Trucks. THAT stabilized the line almost immediately.

The last Regiment, made up mainly of Athens Militia, the last unassigned Vulpine Marines, and the remaining Vulpine Sailors from their own sunken ships (including a particular Petty Officer), arrived right before we left.

This was the 1st NEIGHTO Battalion.

I had at my disposal Dusk Seeker, Webley Weaver, Gilda, Doc Allcome, Teddy, Firecracker Burst, Nurse Sweetheart, Lightning Dust, Broken Dawn, Golden Wattle, Rapid Bearing, Wallflower Blush, Dusty Dunes, Coconut Cream, and Slapshot Eyeblack. Of the girls, I had Trixie, Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash, plus Steela.

Quite the adventuring party.

Now, though, Dusk and I were far forward, between the opposing positions, with 4th Platoon, as we moved to infiltrate the enemy lines. To be specific, though, only 4th Platoon would be going in. I'd be staying behind. Why? They were all Thestrals. Bat Ponies. Something that made other creatures terribly afraid.

And we were about to use that fear to our advantage.

I patted Astral to go ahead of us, as Dusk and I made comfortable by a blasted-out thick oak tree.

K: "Reminds me of when I sent the Prench Marines in to Kyatto Island for a raid." I shrugged. "Difference? These are all pros."

Dusk: "I trained most of them." He nodded.

K: "We'll just have to wait and see." I rolled over and looked through the binoculars.

The enemy had dug a partial trench network, with some hefty some walls, and lumber, making up the rest, above ground. They were well dug in, it was clear. They were very close to the southern Argolis border, so, they had likely accomplished enough of their objective to please their superiors, and were simply ordered to hold the ground.

If that was the case, we really did need to get though here.

I was somewhat surprised to see the enemy had fires going, and some burning torches. They were concealed enough to prevent them from being spotted from 2ID's position, but up close, they were easy targets.

I watched one torch simply go out.

A short swoop of bat wings darkened a cooking fire with five soldiers by it, there were cries of confusion.. the fire was extinguished.. then there were cries of terror, soon silenced. I watched as a 500 meter wide section of the enemy front line went dark as night, and soldier after soldier simply vanished into the inky blackness.

It took them one hour to clear all of that, and return.

Astral Sky: "General." She slid next to me, as the Platoon returned. "We killed at least two full companies of troops. They have tanks assembling just behind the line, I think they're going to make a push in the morning." She shrugged. "No casualties on our side. We left several enemy alive, as instructed, and bit many of them." She spat her mouth out. "Blood tastes terrible."

K: "Let's pull back. We need to concentrate whatever anti-tank assets we have." I motioned.

We slipped back into our own lines without further incident. I went to the command bunker - time to General.

K: "Tan." I nodded.

Gen. Linkletter: "How'd the raid go?" He cocked a brow.

K: "Well enough." I shrugged. "I need most of our anti-tank weapons focused here.. and here.. and here." I identified three spots on the OPMAP. "They're massing cavalry tanks in the rear of the formation's lines. They're going to attack at dawn. But, they'll see what we did here, learn it was Thestrals, and avoid it. They'll be expecting a hard point." I nodded. "Rapid Bearing and Wallflower are pulling the 77's off of your destroyed tanks, so, we'll have at least 4 guns on the line that can ace them from a good distance. Your own 47mm towed guns should be massed here. The third spot will have 5 towed guns, 1 salvaged gun, and as many anti-tank rockets as you can get together. I want them to face mixed threats. When they retreat, I want the assets mixed up and redistributed." I nodded.

Gen. Linkletter: "Alright. I'll see to it, sir." He nodded.

The fight the next morning was going to be bad, I knew it.

I took Dusk, Broken, and Golden and moved us over to the thinnest part of the line. All 2nd ID personnel here.

K: "When the lead starts flying at dawn, remember, our main job is to stop the tanks." I nodded.

Rapid Bearing slid into the trench with us, and handed me and Dusk each a musette bag.

Rapid Bearing: "Some toys. TNT blocks with rudimentary shaped charges. Self adhesive. Pull the white strip, stick it to the tank. Pull the small cord here to start a 5-second count-down." He nodded. "And run like Hades."

K: "How many guns are we going to be able to salvage?" I meant the 77's.

Rapid Bearing: "Seven of them. I'll make sure one gets over here." He nodded.

K: "Good. Everyone get a bit of rest. I want food in stomachs no later than zero-six." I pointed to all of them, and let them each move to different units.

Me, I found a platoon of Foxes around a pit fire, making some coffee.

Sergeant Prime Tully Virespark: "General K." He nodded. "Pull up a sack." And gestured.

I sat next to him, and one of them handed me coffee.

Tully: "Going to be bad tomorrow?" He asked, plainly.

K: "They'll have tanks." I nodded.

Tully: "We have some Walkers and Funstons." He shrugged.

K: "Who's your fastest fox?" I looked around at them.

Tully: "Corporal Falkner." He pointed to a white-marbled fox.

K: "Here." I handed her the charges. "Rip the white strip off to activate the adhesive. Place it adhesive-side down on the weak point of the tank. Pull the cord to start the detonator timer. Five seconds. Use this if they start getting too close."

Cpl. Falkner: "Yes, General." She took the bag and fixed it to her uniform.

K: "Everyone try to get some rest." I nodded.

They all settled in, and they set their watches. I stayed up with the first watch, and made notations on strategy and future operations. I dozed, then woke up about halfway through last watch, and helped Cpl. Falkner make coffee and cook food for the platoon.

A hot meal before they might die. A comfort. An apology.

We made some pork bits cooked into hydrated powdered eggs, corn bread, and warmed up tinned cupcakes. Hardtack was soaked in a quickly made pork broth. We woke up the rest of the platoon one at a time, with breakfast and coffee.

I noted that Foxes were more Coffee than Tea drinkers.

Tully: "..thanks, sir." He smiled. "Not every day a Sergeant gets his food from a General."

K: "All generals should be humble enough to feed their troops. The Marines in my home in human land have a policy that the lowest ranks eat first, and the highest eat last. It's to instill a responsibility for one's soldiers." I patted his shoulder.

True enough, I served myself last. Just as the first rays of light started to peek over the terrain. I ate quickly, saving the coffee for last, to wash it all down. Once done, I checked my Grant and my Dager.


TIME: 06:11 EET


They started smart. Artillery. Light stuff. Sounded like sub-75mm guns. I got up on the edge of the revetment and looked to see if I could find them. They were little flashes in the distance.. hard to make out, but I'd guess 50mm light cannons being pressed into service as artillery.

K: "Take cover, but take it easy. Those guns aren't designed for this."

Indeed, the shells hit dirt and made small booms, but the shrapnel was minimal, and low velocity.

Ten minutes of light bombardment, and it stopped.

K: "WEAPONS READY, FIRE WHEN YOU HAVE TARGETS." I braced my Grant, and looked.

Here they come.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Line of Danger

TIME: 06:24 EET
DATE: War Day 1046/13 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Front Lines, 1km south of Piloroí, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


The enemy infantry advanced first. Despite the very World War I feel to the entrenchments, the enemy advanced like modern infantry. Machine guns covered as riflesdonkeys advanced. We returned fire at everything - I specifically used my scoped Grant to pick off machine gun crews. I knew that RPK-72's would be used and they looked similar to AK-72's, so I made sure to aim for anyone that had a bipod on their weapon.

We took heavy fire right from the start. The infantry advanced smartly, with plenty of overlapping fire. They didn't have grenade launchers or other "force multipliers," but they did have sharpshooters, and they used them decently well. I had to admire the Macedonkians - they were a pound-for-pound match for the Vulpines.

Which was the real problem - the Macedonkians had spent all this time trying to achieve tactical parity with numerical superiority with them, they didn't count on Equestria and NEIGHTO joining them and making those numbers very even, even with us starting off on the back foot.

Right behind the infantry, came halftracks with mounted machine guns and very light cannons (I guessed 20mm or so). We started taking hits, too, as the halftracks crossed the terrain, and the infantry took the first wave of hits for them. I watched several older Walkers from the sides, fire at the halftracks, and knock several out.

Tully: "RIFLE GRENADES! SET RANGE AT 200, FIRE AT WILL!" He called.

I watched as a shower of rifle grenades took out three half tracks, and several infantry. A round skipped off the stone next to my face, and the spray of stone dust made me fall back a bit. I fell on my ass. Rolling over, I crawled away from that firing position, to take up another one.

As I did, the tanks started coming in. Behind the half tracks, and behind the hoof infantry. The REVERSE of what they should have done.

Unless they didn't care about living casualties.

I watched as the reserve infantry came up alongside the tanks, almost shielding them from direct fire from anti-tank weapons. Equally, I saw the Foxes' designated marksfoxes and snipers start picking them off. One unfortunate donkey was hit in the thigh, and run over by his own side's tank.

As we planned, anti-tank guns opened up at this point. Funstons, rifle grenades, and some artillery fire. The cavalry tanks ranks were cut ragged. But, there were still plenty of them, along with remaining hoof and mechanized troops. They were going to get to us very quickly.

K: "CALLING AN AIR STRIKE!" I called towards the platoon leader, and made my way over to the nearest anti-tank gun - an Equestrian war aid 76mm gun. "Who's got comms?"

Lt. Vines: "Lieutenant Vines, sir. Over here." He motioned.

I got over to the older fox, and looked back. The enemy was almost here.

K: C> "Alpha to any TacAir, come in!"

Weisskreuz One: C> "Weisskreuz One, vee read zhou, Alpha."

K: C> "Weisskreuz One, we need air support. Sector five, right along the line - the whole thing. The enemy is almost on us. Calling in Danger Close."

Weisskreuz One: C> "Ja, Alpha. ETA two minutes!"

Lt. Vines: "SIR!" He tapped my shoulder.

I turned to see what.. I didn't want to see. Heavier tanks. They reminded me of T-34-76's.

K: "Target th-"

I saw blackness for a few moments, and felt myself thrown. I was alive, but I hurt. My arm.. right arm.. wasn't working. I shook off the stars, and rolled over, and realized I'd been tossed about three meters from the gun. I looked down at my arm, and tried to move it. Nothing. My Grant wasn't in my arms any more. So, I tried to roll over (pain), and grabbed my Dager with my left hand. Getting over on my stomach, I crawled back to the gun pit.

Getting to the edge, I saw that Lt. Vines was clearly dead, so was most of the gun crew. I crawled to the gun itself, and saw the spall shield had taken some damage, but the gun was intact.

K: "HELP MEEEEEEEE!" I screamed as loud as I could.

Broken Dawn: "K!" He dove into the pit just ahead of a stitch of machine gun bullets. "Are you o-" He looked me in the face. "Oh, K."

K: "Help me with the gun." I said, jamming my pistol into my waist band, and grabbing a shell.

Broken Dawn: "You need a Medic!" He said, but opened the breech.

K: "Yeah, later." I slid the shell in and let the breech shut automatically.

Broken Dawn: "Okay.." He messed with the elevation and traverse. "FIRE!"

I pulled the cord, and the round went out, hitting one of the T-34's in the tread, and crippling it. Mobility Kill. Good enough.

I didn't even notice the shell had blood smeared on it when it ejected.

K: "ANOTHER!" I demanded.

Broken Dawn: "Yes, but just a minute!" He insistently pushed me back and quickly got a bandage over my upper arm from his IFAK. "You're bleeding!"

K: "I'll worry about it later." I said, grabbing the next shell and passing it to him.

Broken Dawn: "Alright." He said, taking it in his hooves and feeding it into the breech.

I got ready to fire as Broken fixed the range and azimuth.

Broken Dawn: "Fire!" He commanded.

Again, I pulled the cord. The shell went out, and I watched it hit the turret of the "T-34" tank, and as I feared, failed to penetrate.

Broken Dawn: "Thick hides!" He tersely cursed.

K: "That's alright - cavalry's here!" I pointed to the sky.

Tac Air arrived at that time. Wave one machine gunned and hit the ground targets with light rockets. The second wave dropped bombs on the armored and mechanized units. There were Donkeys in our trenches, but they were being repulsed. Especially now that their backup was under attack. Then, the third and fourth waves came in and mopped up.

The remaining enemy retreated. We'd won.

I heard cheering. I slid back on the sandbags behind me, and sighed.

Broken Dawn: "Alpha Two-Seven, I need a medic - General K is injured." He said calmly before pulling out his canteen and carefully washing my face. "You're a mess, K."

K: "Yeah." I smiled. "But, we won."

Broken Dawn: "We did." He nodded, smiling a bit.

K: "I can't look THAT bad!" I chuckled as Dr. Allcome got over to me. "Hey, Cody."

Dr. Allcome: "..." He grunted. "GET ME A LITTER! NOW!" He called to the Vulpine Medics with him.

I guess I was?

Oh, hello, darkness, my old friend!

I sat up on the gurney. My right arm was bandaged completely. It ached. I felt my face up and realized it was bandaged a bit, too. I grabbed my glasses, and put them on, so I could see. I realized they were my spare pair.

Applejack: "Ya'll're hurt again." She slid into the gurney next to me. "Broken said yer face was pale's'a ghost, bleedin' all over. He thought yew was gonna check out." She nuzzled me.

K: "How bad's the arm?" I asked.

Applejack: "Mmm.. ah'm gonna be takin' the lead in bed a while." She shrugged.

Dusty slid into bed behind me.

Dusty: "Shrapnel in the arm, possible fracture." She nuzzled the back of my neck. "Cuts along the face. No big deal there."

K: "Okay." I shrugged. "I'll rest, then."

Applejack: "Enemy wuz pushed back far. Our scrap unit done advanced purty far. We took the town in the counter-attack." She slid her arm over my hip, and Dusty did the same from the other side, to pin me.

K: "You two aren't letting me get up, are you?" I chuckled a bit.

Steela: "J'yes, we won't." She rose up from the foot of the gurney.

Cody came in, then, with a cart that had food on it.

Dr. Allcome: "We're going to send you to the rear. You need at least a week's rest." He shrugged. "If your arm's still hurting around the bone after a few days, we'll get it into a cast."

K: "Gotcha." I nodded.

Dr. Allcome: "It's a good thing Broken got to you. You passed out as soon as I called for a Litter. We might not've found you in time, otherwise." He shrugged.

K: "I'll be sure to thank him." I nodded with a grin.

Raven Inkswell: "General!" She trotted in - Equestria's Secretary of State. "Oh, thank Celestia!" She sighed. "Miss Applejack, I brought a convoy of supply trucks, and the last freshly trained Vulpine recruits." She nodded, and pulled out a clipboard. "We have full resupply - 33 days of food, 17 days of fire." She looked up. "We can take the wounded back in the trucks, ma'am."

Applejack: "Awright." She nodded. "Ah'm goin' with - all four'a us."

Steela: "Is no lie." She shrugged. "I am sworn to protect, but he make it VERY HARD to do this!" She giggled.

Dusk and Webley peeked their heads in at this point.

Dusk: "Since you're going to the rear, am.. I taking charge, here?" He tilted his head.

K: "Yeah, pretty much. You and Webs work together." I shrugged. "Time for you to learn how to be a field officer. You ARE of equal technical rank."

Webley Weaver: "Wait, I'm only a Major-" She blinked. "Oh, no! Not again!"

K: "You've been with me almost as long as the lads have. YOU deserve this. Lieutenant Colonel. Besides, I think between the two of you, and General Linkletter, you can get this done." I gestured.

Dusk: "Well, come on, Colonel." He joked.

Webley Weaver: "Some war this is! I started out as a Platoon Leader.." She snorted, rolled her head, but smiled at me. "Thanks for having faith in me, K."

K: "You earned it." I nodded.


TIME: 07:31 EET
DATE: War Day 1047/14 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Medical Convoy enroute to Athens, 5km south of Piloroí, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


We'd waited until the next morning and after breakfast to load the wounded and get them ready to depart. Did I ever mention, so far, that most pony pain relievers don't work well on me? Their primary anaesthetic and pain killer is actually Ketamine. Which makes sense from a biological perspective. While it CAN be used on humans in an emergency, it's not the best. Morphine is available in some situations, but not common. So, whenever I get injured, I usually just have to deal with the pain.

This was one of those times. Webley had a morphine syrette in her IFAK, as they're standard issue to Paratroopers, but it's a pony dose. For me, with my injury, all it really did was take the edge off, and make me feel a bit loopy.

I was in the back of one of the trucks. Applejack, Steela, and Dusty were in there with me, as was Raven. She and I were going over logistics. We were fortunate to be close to Roam, and more so that they'd had a massive bumper crop last year, with the war effort imploring farmers to increase yields as best as possible. Food was one thing we wouldn't have to worry about.

Given Equus' lower population compared to Earth, but a similar amount by measure (possibly more) arable land, AND the ability to recruit Pegasi to maintain year 'round agreeable weather, magic made it possible for us to maintain a thick bread basket. Equestria, especially, with its vibrant heartland farms, now aided also by some automation with Tractors, was producing almost 400% more food than it had pre-war.

Considering we were handing out food aid to the Griffons, the Hippogriffs, and even to our other allies, it was still enough that we didn't even need to think about instituting rationing. THAT ALONE was a huge deal - rationing can seriously impact national morale and war fatigue.

Raven Inkswell: "..and with the scrap metal program, we're finding there's a lot of old things around that were simply abandoned and disused. Some of them have been repaired and put into service. Like steam boilers." She shrugged, flipping through her clipboards. "The NEIGHTO Radio Service is now reaching 100% of Equestria - technically. There's still a lot of homes that don't have their own radio, but every town and village has at least one." She smiled - that had been HER personal baby.

K: "I know how much you value bringing, gathering, and passing out information, Raven. I'm happy to hear this." I smiled, and gave her ear skritchies.

Applejack beamed a wide grin at the news, too.

Applejack: "S'hore'nuff, be glad to be able to reach folks'n keep'em updated." She nodded.

Our briefing was interrupted by the sound of a bullet impact on the side of the truck. Then another sound, more meaty, and the truck skidded off the road.

Steela: "SNIPERS!" She stuck her nose out from under the edge of the canvas. "I cannot see 'dem!"

K: "Bail out! BAIL OUT!" I called, and (painfully) threw myself out of the back of the truck, to take cover in the ditch next to the road.

The medics in the other trucks were trying to get the wounded to cover. But, every now and then, a shot would ring out, and drop someone.

K: "AJ! DUSTY!" I called.

Dusty: "Well, shit! I can't see 'em, K! They're coming from the hill to our three o'clock, but I don't see any muzzle flashes!"

Steela: "Attacking wounded! How despicable!" She set up her Abrams.

K: "Yeah, it's not like we aren't properly marked." I shrugged. "Dusty! SMOKE!"

Dusty: "On it!"

She got a smoke shell into her Gavin, and pitched it up at a high angle, so it'd land between us and the snipers. She fired off three of them, with the wind, and obscured us rather well. Still, the trucks were big targets, and they could always just guess.

And, indeed, our convoy was marked with the Red Cross on each vehicle. Just like Nurse Redheart's cutie mark, the Red Cross was an international symbol for medical aid. There was, however, nothing like the Geneva or Hague conventions in this world. It was simply considered unthinkable and barbaric to attack the wounded, and medics.

Then again, the Khyangese had done it at Paradise Estates.

Applejack: "Now h'wut, honeybun?" She whispered over to me. "We're the only one's've got guns! And you ain't in no condition to fight!"

I had my Dager out, nonetheless.

K: "We need a radio." I shrugged. "Second truck has one." I went to get up, but Applejack pulled me back.

Applejack: "Hell, no, honeybun! Ah'll git it!" She scooted down low, and nodded to Steela.

Steela opened up with random short bursts at the hillside, while Applejack made her move. I fired a couple random shots myself, just in case it'd help. I looked over, and Raven was braced against the front wheel of the first truck, levitating her Franchi MHT-03 shotgun and manually feeding shells into it from an expense pouch. While all the shotguns produced here can technically do this, I had designed the ejecting tube magazine system because, other than Unicorns, it'd be a chore to do this as a pony.

Raven Inkswell: "The driver is dead, sir." She said, hurriedly.

K: "Dusty." I looked to my other side.

Dusty: "Yeah." She nodded to me.

K: "Get further over towards Truck three. Put down a few more smoke shells." I leaned up with my working arm and tapped the utility box on the side of the truck. "If you need more, all the tool kits have some smoke shells in them."

Dusty: "Gotcha." She slid out from her position, and made a dash for it.

Raven Inkswell: "I can't believe they're doing this." She snorted. "It's so.. so... dastardly!" She raised up into a kneel and fired off a few shells randomly.

K: "Just goes to show that we need to protect and escort convoys - if Tirek's allies are doing this, then Tirek's own forces wont' hesitate. It's good we learned this lesson." I shrugged with one arm.

Raven Inkswell: "I-I suppose. I mean.. is it always the case that the bad guys follow ZERO rules and norms, and the good guys always do?" She blinked and shrugged. "I guess so, huh?"

K: "Well, Tirek's something of a special case. He has zero morals. Some 'bad guys' do, and act honorably, even if they oppose you." I shrugged. "Some enemies have a moral code, some don't. Some pretend to, but discard it the second it becomes inconvenient." I gestured with my Dager. "When dealing with them, it's best to just assume they'll do whatever suits them. Don't count on egotistical chivalry."

Raven Inkswell: "Mrr." She rolled back over and topped off her shotgun. "I'm going to try to get to the jeep out front and see if they have anything. Cover me." She nodded.

Steela: "I reposition first." She looked to me. "Machine gun would have better coverage over there." She pointed to a divoted rise in the side of the road much more towards the front of the convoy line.

K: "Go for it." I nodded. "Cover fire, Raven." I aimed my pistol, and fired a few shots.

Raven did likewise, and Steela bolted for it. For her size, she was VERY FAST. All that muscle. Technically, if it was an emergency, she was strong enough to let me ride her. Then again, the only thing stopping me from riding Applejack was her size.

Once Steela set up, She covered Raven, who moved behind her as she moved to the lead jeep to see if it had anything in it that we could use. It wasn't set up with a pintile machine gun, but Equestrian jeeps had cargo boxes and often carried all kinds of things.

This left me alone. I wasn't really afraid, though. The enemy was on the other side of the road. Steela was covering the front door, and Dusty was covering the back door.

See, though, I didn't realize that isolating the few people with guns, was the plan. I didn't realize that I was the target. Not until I heard hooves - unmistakably donkey hooves - rush up from behind me.

I rolled over in time to see five of them advancing on me, with weapons raised.

K: "SHIT!" I extended my left arm, and fired seven times, hitting three of them, and running empty - the slide locked back.

Welp, I'm boned. I can't reload very fast with one hand, a-

Raven Inkswell: "GENERAL!" She yelled, dashing over on her hind legs, firing her Franchi off her shoulder.

The remaining two Donkeys were folded in half from the slug shells she was loaded with. They didn't even have time to turn and look at her. One of them had his head blown apart as he fell, spattering Raven with the backwash.

She threw herself down next to me, and very calmly levitated my Dager, used her Unicorn telekinesis to eject the magazine, and put in a fresh one, then rack the slide and levitate it back into my left hand. As she did this, she physically hit the tube magazine ejector on her Franchi and loaded another tube in.

K: "Raven.. that was-" She was smiling at me.

Raven Inkswell: "Thanks to you, I've come a long way, General." She blushed a bit.

K: "Just K, Raven." I pet her mane.

From a high strung, perpetually panicking assistant to Princess Celestia, to Secretary of State, to bloodied combat veteran. Raven Inkswell had come a VERY long way indeed.

GENERAL ORDER #77-14/SEC/05

IT IS HEREBY DIRECTED: ALL THESTRALS SERVING IN THE N.E.I.G.H.T.O. ALLIANCE ARE WELCOMED TO SERVE OPENLY AS THEIR RACE. NO RACISM OR INTOLERANCE TOWARDS THESTRALS SHALL BE PERMITTED. VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED UNDER THE UNIFIED CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE.

SIGNED: GENERAL-FIELD MARSHAL K, SAC
GENERAL de BRIGADE PHILIPPE SAQUET, DEPUTY SAC


K: "No more bullshit." I nodded, signing the order with my left hand.

Sacquet: "I did not believe there WAS any such things!" He shrugged. "Thestrals are something of a myth in Prance, mon ami." He patted my shoulder. "Rest, oui? Myself and Forest Spirit have your back."

K: "Thanks, buddy." I nodded, smiling.

Sacquet: "Anything you need!" He nodded to me, and Julienne set a basket of goodies next to me. "Grape juice from my family vineyard. And good food from my kin, for you." He gave me a half hug. "You get yourself so injured so often.."

K: "I said before, I'd die right now if it meant everypony here could be free and happy again." I nodded firmly.

Julienne: "Oui. It is why a lady was curious of you, and why we follow you." She nodded.

K: "Your friendship and loyalty means everything to me." I smiled.

Dr. Knochen: "Ja, ja. Now out. Zee patient must rest." He toddled in with his wife, and they set about checking my bandages.

Sacquet: "Oui. I shall report if anything arises, mon ami." He nodded, and he and Julienne departed.

Dr. Knochen: "Zee wound is.. not zo bad, I thinks." He shrugged. "I will debride it later if needed. For now, I think it shall heal. A week or so, maybe two." He nodded. "It seems zere is no bone damage, though if zere is pain, I will see to an X-Ray."

K: "Sounds good, Doc. So, rest and recuperation. Again." I nodded.

Dr. Knochen: "Ja." He smiled. "I shall have nurse check you in a couple of hours. Sleep as much as'z'you can. Sleep heals all." He patted my head, and they departed.

So... now I was pretty much alone in the room. At least for now. I examined the goodie basket.. mmm.. good grapes. GREAT juice. Better than Welch's. I could tell they were grown with care. The cheese was nice, too.

I laid back, and stared at the ceiling, and let myself doze off.

Luna was.. very comforting.. in my dreams. Very. Comforting.


TIME: 09:23 EET
DATE: War Day 1062/30 Secundus, 1005 C.S.


Dr. Allcome: "..and while you might be healed, expect some weakness in that arm for some time. A couple of weeks, at least, until you get back into shape." He was getting ready to discharge me.

K: "Yeah, I get it. Walk it off." I nodded.

Dr. Allcome: "You ARE at that stage, yes. You're very lucky there was no fracture." He nodded.

Fluttershy: "I'll be sure to look after him, Cody." She smiled.

Golden Wattle: "AYE! He'll be with us." He nodded.

Broken Dawn: "Don't worry. We have him." He smiled.

K: "Broken.. again.. you saved my life." I nodded to him, and put my LEFT hand on his shoulder.

Broken Dawn: "I know you'd do the same for me, K." He beamed a grin.

K: "Any time." I nodded. "AJ? Where are we needed?"

Applejack: "Aw, well, we'll be needin' t'go back to the front. Now that we got all 'em NEIGHTO boys here, we c'n git to the offensive right proper." She gestured. "We gots a jeep."

K: "Sounds good." I shrugged. "I need a weapon." I patted my empty hip where my combat belt should be.

Applejack brought me over to the jeep, and handed me my Type-34 PDW, which I could use onehanded if I had to, and my Dager. I also got my sword back, and my tool pouch. I got my belt on with some difficulty, and once cinched up, I got in the passenger seat of the jeep. Broken drove, AJ manned the Abrams MG on the back.

It took us a bit to get to the front lines. They'd been pushed back according to plan, and we were on the verge of retaking the land lost in the initial invasion at the beginning of the month. The thing is, we had mobility. Even without armored mechanized units, the Vulpes made up for it with unarmored motor rifles units, by grabbing every possible motorized vehicle they could manage, and pressing it into service.

That mobility had blunted the advance of the Macedonkians and Tarpangoslavians. They did have armored formations, but they used them unwisely, piecemeal, and with no anti-air ability outside of basic rifle caliber machine guns. They didn't account for the extensive use and employment of anti-tank guns, either.

In all, the Macedonkians would have had a much better chance if they'd attacked three months before.

Now, the Navarese, Germane, Roaman, Prench, and Ambleonian forces were here. I had a division from each of them. Adding up the combat losses from the invaders, they'd lost three divisions of equipment and two and a half in hoofpower. Their elite invading formations had been shattered, and they were down to the middle of the ranks of their troops. They lacked mechanized formations with experience, at this point, and were simply holding the line. Our own scouting reports told us they were thoroughly motorized, but had limited mechanized units, and fewer tanks. The tank assault we repulsed two weeks ago, constituted probably 25% of their remaining armor.

This was dangerous. I expected them to come back with something big, or sue for White Peace. They had so far not attempted the latter, and I feared the former.


TIME: 21:16
LOCATION: Front line area, Liveria, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


We drove into the command area, and were greeted by other CAG members. This is where the main push would be. The 1st Panzergrenadier Division, with the 1e Mechanized Infantry Division from Prance, would be the spearhead. The Equestrian 1st Infantry Division would follow behind, plug gaps, and exploit side areas.

1st Division Commander, Brigadier General Meadow Song: "K!" He RAN over to see me. "Boy, am I glad to see you." He beamed a grin. "Long way from Ponyville, huh?"

K: "Sure is, Meadow." I nodded to him. "What's our status?"

Meadow Song: "We jump off at midnight. Night attack with the Rangers and Jaegers at the spear tip, then once we get the signal, a general offensive." He nodded, pulling me over to the map table, where the Prench and Germane officers were.

K: "Hm. Looks good." I nodded, then nodded to the other officers.

General de Brigade Grande Bravado: "Oui, mon Marechal." He nodded to me. "Grande Bravado." And stuck out his hoof, which I shook.

Generalmajor Geschmiedet Stahl: "Generalmajor Stahl." She stuck out her hoof to me. She was an odd one - cut fine, well structured Earth pony of a dark coat and striking blonde mane, with a dueling scar and a monocle. She wore her greatcoat across her shoulders, and carried both saber and pistol. "Erst Panzergrenadiers." A curt nod.

K: "General Stahl." I nodded to her.

Meadow Song: "We're ready, K." He nodded. "The Prench and Germane troops might be unblooded, but they're well trained, and have some veterans from Navarre mixed in as NCO's."

K: "Alright, then." I looked at them both. "I have every confidence you'll lead your troops excellently." I smiled a bit.

Gmjr Stahl: "Jahwol, Herr Feldmarschall." She clicked her boots together, and stood to attention.

K: "Fraulien General. Bitte entspannen Sie sich ein wenig. Du wirst es gut machen. Nennen Sie mich K." I put a hand on her shoulder.

Gmjr Stahl: "J-Ja.. Herr K." She struggled to let down her guard, but did, a bit.

K: "Meadow, I'll go in with 1st Company of our troops. I'm not in condition to lead all the way from the front-"

Applejack: "Ah won't let'em." She stated, glaring at me.

K: "-but, I'll lead the second line of the advance, and keep an eye out for anything we might need to address. You KNOW we'll find something we don't want." I nodded.

Gmjr Stahl: "Herr K. Please. Use mein personal Panzer." She nodded to the -

K: "Holy Celestia, that's a Maus." I smirked.

Gmjr Stahl: "Nein. Ist Ratte." She grinned widely. "Twelve point eight centimeter naval gun." She patted the side of it. "Und machine guns, very heavy armor. Ist slow, but almost unkillable." She shrugged a small bit. "Vhould be mein honor to have you ride it."

K: "It would be mine as well." I grinned madly.

Gmjr Stahl: "..Es ist nicht einmal der größte Panzer, den wir haben werden..." She muttered under her breath so I could hear.

I grinned EVEN WIDER.

It was about damn time we had something GENUINELY BIGGER than our enemies. The bigger stick. So we could stop being underdogs in some of these engagements, relying on skill, luck, and friendship to get us through.

Friendship is Magic, after all, but a bigger and better tank makes that friendship deliverable at a considerable distance.
