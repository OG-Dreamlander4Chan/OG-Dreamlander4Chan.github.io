	DISCLAIMER!

	There's a few things I have to say, here, actually. And this goes out to my readers as an advisement.

	-Put no weight on any hot button topics you might see in here. I did not, in any way, write anything with the intent of "making a statement" or "to start a discussion." I wrote this for fun. Please leave filthy Hoomlin politics out of Equestria.

	-EVERYTHING was initially written (the first 33 original chapters) from the perspective of the end of Season 2, and from the lens of popular theory at the time. As a result, there will be some "inaccuracies" to Show Canon.

	-When I decided recently that I was going to actually post this on the Internet, I went back through and smoothed out a lot of bumps and filled in some gaps. This ended up adding some chapters to the beginning of the story. As a result of this, some early chapters DO NOT follow the "five Parts to one Chapter" structure.

	-I also went through and changed SOME details to align with SHOW CANON, but ONLY in a FEW very specific areas. These relate to Sombra and Pinkie. Relating to the point above, at the end of S2, we didn't know, then, what we know now. Since those two things, I considered to be significant "canon events," I re-wrote some specific details to align with them.

	-I did NOT change any of the other core details of the story, or took the chance to "cheat" things and correct "mistakes" that were made by the characters. I simply enhanced what was already there. Trust me, there's more than a few details I'd love to have changed, but I felt doing so would violate the story's integrity.

	-Another thing I did NOT change was the Fandom's initial insistance that Lyra Heartstrings had an Irish accent. I know they gave her a voice, later, but I'm not changing this detail, as that's how I'd written her in a significant part of the story already, and that detail was somewhat important to MY Canon events. So, Lyra, here, is Irish.

	-There are A LOT of adult situations in the main story, and at least for the first 50-odd chapters, quite a few written-out sex scenes. I cooled it with the smut, afterwards, but did "fade to black" instead.

	-There are A LOT of references to /mlp/ culture and 4Chan board culture in general, in the story, along with A LOT of in-jokes and lampshading of different cultural points that might not make sense to the casual reader.

	-You read this at your own risk. In a lot of cases, I bend Canon over a barrel and violate it with a Redwood. At the end of the day, this IS "FiMFiction," and there are actual justifications for the various Canon violations, in the story. If you get offended by how I treat certain characters, that's your right. You could also.. not read any more, if it offends you that bad. I'm not going to apologise for what I wrote.

	-On that subject, though, understand that there aren't any characters in FiM that I didn't like. I do, in fact, like them all, and this is a testament to how GOOD of a job the Show Writers did in the first place.

	-I don't personally Ship any of the characters in FiM. I do, however, write up a lot of pairings in the story, because romantic relationships are a part of life. I don't write them with prejudice or favor, I go by how and where the story leads me. Sometimes, I follow with what ended up happening in Canon, sometimes I don't.
