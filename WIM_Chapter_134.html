Part 1: Senatus

TIME: 08:26 CET
DATE: War Day 1016/14 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: City of Roam, Roaman Empire


We arrived by train. The last few days were spent ironing out the fallout from the Gaea Incident, as it would be called. The truth of the matter would be buried. The official story was, that the Spirit of Gaea took over Gloriosa Daisy after tempting her with the idea of being able to protect her camp, and while unleashing her was Daisy's fault, ultimately, Gaea was to blame for the death and destruction.

When the public learned why, there was a rather "expected by Ponies" reaction to it - even the families of those that perished, wanted to see to it that Daisy and Timber's debts were cleared, realizing that the root of this pain lay with Sky Stinger's father. He would shoulder the lion's share of the blame for letting this situation happen. His business partners, seeing the scandal unfold, immediately canceled all debts related to the camp, and extended a 15,000 Bits line of credit to keep it operating for the rest of the season.

Dusk and Brindle spent time with Sky, encouraging him to keep moving forwards in life, despite the death of his father. Sky didn't blame me for not being able to save him. Dusk and Brindle, too, I could see, grew closer over the tragedy. It was almost to a point where the pain of the past was gone. Not quite, but I did catch them laughing together, when Trixie mentioned she wanted to birth better foals for him than Rarity, and Rarity retorted with hers being more talented.

Sky and Aria elected to return to Coltorado to run the camp, and Rainbow Shine requested leave from her unit to do the same. I agreed. Gloriosa's formal military guard after her trial, would be Sky and Rainbow Shine. She was to be escorted to the Camp and placed under observation as she conducted her Community Service - that is, run the camp, and teach foals about Friendship, and the dangers of falling to temptation and violence.

I had no idea that this, also, largely changed the future.


I was being escorted - as well as all of CAG - by the Castrum Pedites Urbs Regia (translated: Legion of the Royal City, or, the elite unit of the Roaman Legion assigned to Roam itself), and close protectiton provided by the "Frumentarii" (officially called the "Publica Aliquam, or P.A.). The Legionnaires were in Class "B" dress, and were marching on either side of us. Unlike our reception in Ambleon, we weren't escorted in a motor carriage. The route to the Atrium Senatus Publicum wasn't terribly long from the train station.

Gio: "I am'a glad you finally make it, Mi Amico." He slapped the side of my arm in a side embrace. "I think'a, of all'a de ponies I meet in this war.. ponies, others. YOU! You are my one dearest friend." He beamed.

K: "I'm glad to hear that, Gio." I nodded. "I'll have to come visit, after the war's over."

Applejack: "Boy, howdy! Ah'd LOVE some'a Mama's Spaghetti!" She trotted next to me, a bit proud, and enjoying the attention.

The crowds of Roam were welcoming us as Heroes. Word had gotten out that the Equestrian fleet had singlehandedly destroyed a force ten times its size. The Roaman people were cheering this - I wasn't 100% sure this was as grand a victory as it seemed.

We made our way to the Senate Compound, doing our best to make sure the civilians had reasons to smile - cheering with them, petting the foals, and waving. Several times, we were stopped and offered gifts, which we accepted.

Once we were at the Senate Building, we were ushured into a large meeting room. Princeps Veloce was there. I hadn't seen him properly in a couple years - he had a bit of grey in his mane, now. The stress of the war.

Princeps Veloce: "General K." He nodded warmly to me. "I want to start by'a saying.. I apologize for.. being.. let's say.. hesitant to join this alliance." He shrugged. "You'a prove, time and'a again, we inn'a 'dis thing together." He gestured to Gio. "Gio. See we get our refreshment, yes?"

Gio: "Si, Princeps." He beamed a grin, and toddled off.

We all sat down.

K: "You made him Chief of Operations for the Roaman Navy. A good choice. He's aggressive when he needs to be, careful when required, and he cares for his troops." I nodded a bit.

Princeps Veloce: "Si, and my closest advisor on the war. Part because he is my familia." He shrugged. "I hear tell from Prime Minister Twilight that you are plotting an invasion."

K: "Yes, and with the Equestrian Fleet that was sunk recently, I'll need to rely on Roam and Prance to get this done." I nodded. "It's time to thoroughly blood your forces."

Princeps Veloce: "Si. I agree. How do you wish to do this?" He shrugged.

K: "Simple enough. The enemy does not use proper tactics and relies entirely on simple weapons. We want to avoid any more destruction in the city and towns around Hippogriffia, so, minimal bombardment. We will need strafing runs by fighters, though." I nodded.

Twilight: "We think we'll need about two battalions of troops to clear the island and caves. CAG will be going with - in case the Storm King is there." She shrugged.

Dusk: "I'd like to take standard troops for this - does Roam have seperate Naval Infantry like the Equestrian Marines, or are the Legions also their replacement?" He up-nodded to Princeps Veloce.

Princeps Veloce: "While we do have a Legion primarily tasked with that, si, we also have the Forza dei Lagunari. Amphibious soliders that specalized in naval landings. This should be enough, I think? I.. admit.. their training was lacking until the war began, BUT! I can trust their commander." He nodded.

Sunset: "..another relative of yours?" She smirked.

Twilight shot her a look with a cocked brow. Raven blinked a bit, and Rarity gently shook her head.

Princeps Veloce: "Actually, si." He nodded. "My niece. Colonello Tira Misu Veloce." And shrugged. "You will find, my friends, many of my senior most officials and officers are from my family."

K: "I get that you had trouble with Mafia families before." I shrugged.

Princeps Veloce: "Si, si. Many troubles. It became so that we could only trust familia. So, throughout the last century, we worked hard to move ourselves into many important positions. There are.. still.. some difficulties. Actually, General, I have heard.. you.. understand them?"

K: "I understand the Roaman-descended Mafiosos of my homeland, which is much like Equestria. Roaman mafiosos are an entirely different matter - different formalities, different manners of respect, and so on-"

Princeps Veloce: "I will be direct, then. The majority of them do not think this war is worth the price in blood." He nodded firmly to me.

Elsie: "Oh, REALLY?" She frowned. "I've worked very hard to make people understand.."

Princeps Veloce: "I would.. ask.. privately.. if you could speak with them." He nodded to me.

K: "Has something been arranged?" I tilted my head.

Princeps Veloce: "Not before you grant me your approval to do so - war or no war, I would not presume." He nodded sagely to me.

K: "Go ahead. Let them know I want to speak to their family heads. No middlemen, no representatives. Everyone comes unarmed. One aide each." I nodded slowly to him.

Princeps Veloce: "Agreed." He nodded back to me. "They will likely insist to meet you on Sicily."

K: "That's fine." I nodded back. "Phillipe?" I nodded to Sacquet.

Sacquet: "We will provide a battalion as well." He nodded. "Fresh troops, led by some of those who partook in the Neighpon Operation." He shrugged. "And me, of course." He grinned.

K: "Sounds excellent. I think between us, we can get this done easily. Forest Spirit and Rapid Bearing will brief the troops about how the Storm King's soldiers act and their tactics." I nodded. "Now." I saw Gio come in with food and drinks. "How's about some breakfast?" I smiled.

Princeps Veloce: "Indeed. You shall be our guest." He nodded.

So, we had the basics of the invasion plan worked out. Soon enough, the Hippogriffs would be freed and worked into NEIGHTO. More allies against Tirek. Another brick stacked into our growing wall. Had the fleet action seriously damaged Tirek? Or was that just wishful thinking? Only time would tell.

Part 2: Sicilian Slice

TIME: 19:26 CET
DATE: War Day 1019/17 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Palermo, Sicily, Roaman Empire


We spent a day in Roam, enjoying the sights. I toook Applejack on a date to the Coliseum. Instead of Gladiatorial fights to the death, they had a variation of "Pugilatus" - which was just pony boxing. Fun to watch, really, as, even though it was a "violent" sport, fighters rarely fought to the point of incapacitatiton, and there was a huge emphasis on fair play, and accepting when one is outmatched. They also flooded the Coliseum and did a mock sea battle with large boats, from "Old Roam."

Really, I got a taste of what the REAL -ROMAN- citizen could get. The significance of this, was not lost on me. Roam's Coliseum was very well taken care of. It was so nice to be able to sit, eat "Old Roaman" stadium food, and take in the sights. We ended the evening with a moonlight walk on the beach.. and.. hot raunch in the Hotel room afterwards (after she had some Roaman wine).

Healthy marriage, right here.

The next day, we needed to make our way to Sicily. It took us several hours to get to the port at Calabria to take the ferry. Once aboard, we went to Messina, then took a train to Termini. We had to walk from there. That was over 20 miles, so, it took us almost a full day to do. Especially in the mountainous terrain. We stopped in the town of Monreale for the day, before Elsie and I made our way to Palermo, and our designated meeting.

Mafioso Pony: "General K." He addressed us, stepping up, and opening his coat to show he had no weapons. "You.. are asked to come with me, si?"

K: "Of course. This is Elsie Bon Voyage." I gestured to her. "My aide."

Mafioso Pony: "Si." He nodded. "Come."

We followed him. We were brought to a large warehouse. Along the way, I could tell that "protection" had been arranged. When we entered, we were both frisked - but, I noted, Elsie was frisked by a mare. We were then brought inside and seated at a very large table.

24 Family Heads. 24 assistants. Plus me.

Vincenzo Corleone: "Greetings, General K. I am Vincenzo Corleone." He bowed his head a bit. "After much'a debate, I was selected to do most'a de talking."

K: "I am honored to be in the presence of so many fine Mares and Gentlecolts." I noted that at least three of the Family Heads were females - this would never be so, on Earth.

Vincenzo Corleone: "Mm. We'a.. we hear'dat you have had interactions.. with.. ehh.. cousin families? In Equestria." He nodded to me.

K: "Yes, and I understand that manners are very different, here." I nodded to him.

Vincenzo Corleone: "Si." He nodded with a small smile. "You are'a as.. cultured.. I see.. as we were told." He cocked an eyebrow.

K: "I endeavor to be polite and respectful, sirs and ma'ams." I looked at him, but addressed them all.

Vincenzo Corleone: "Understand, this is.. the second time.. in one thousand years that all the families' heads have sat at the same table." He nodded.

K: "I understand that.. requires a great deal of trsut and interest." I nodded. "Which is why I extended a personal guarantee that, at least frorm my side, there would be zero interference. There would be no tricks, no traps, no betrayal."

Vincenzo Corleone: "You hold much sway within the alliance." He nodded back.

K: "I do." I nodded in return.

Vincenzo Corleone: "Then, I will address the heart of the matter - not every family here thinks this war is worth fighting." He shrugged. "That includes me."

Elsie: "Then you're fools." She said, coldly.

Everyone paused, and looked at her. The room was dead silent.

This is why I brought her.

Elsie: "I have spent the last several months since The East Indies Campaign.. trying to explain two things. The cost.. and the purchase." She sighed. "Yes, this war is going to hurt. A lot. It's going to cost. A lot. But, it's a purchase we all have to make. Why? Because what defeat means. Tirek can't be reasoned with. He can't be negotiated with." She looked at each one of them in turn. "Some of you might be accepting Bits from him, in exchange for.. whatever. I don't care. That arrangement will end the second you are of no use to him. He has already betrayed most of his Lieutenants - Trixie, Grogar, even his paramour, Somnambula. They all felt the sting of his knife in their backs, once they'd outlived their usefulness. And you will, too. Each one of you that makes a deal with him, or his cohorts, is exposing yourselves to him. If he wins, he will simply eliminate you. His goal is enslavement of every pony, griffon, and other race in the Inner World. The destruction of our individuality. The strong will be conscripts in his vast army. The weak will be extracted in his Rainbow Factories, where he LITERALLY JUICES INNOCENT CREATURES.. to feed his Rainbow of Darkness. And when you are EXTRACTED.. there is NOTHING LEFT!" She leaned forwards, letting the tears come. "Your very SOULS are destroyed. Your marks on this world will NEVER return!" She swung a foreleg in a sweeping motion. "And neither will you. Ever." She slid back in her seat. "I've seen this war up close. I've.. I've had to kill. I've had to watch good ponies die. But, I've also seen what Tirek will do to each one of us, if he wins." And she shook her head. "Do YOU want to see YOUR foals get THEIR SOULS simply JUICED out of them like apples in a cider press!? He'll do it. He'll do it. Genociding us is his last goal, after he uses the strongest of us to breach the Ley Line Barrier." She frowned. "And unleash on this world, whatever horrors lie beyond it. And expend his slaves as meat shields to stop it, then conquer it." She shrugged a bit. "And once he rules ALL of the world? We die. That's it. Total eradication." She scowled. "And there's any of you at this table that doubts what the purchase is? We're literally buying the survival of our species with our blood." She looked at me. "And as far as I'm concerned, he's the ONLY creature on this planet that can lead us out of this." And then back to the others. "Do not ever doubt him, or his committment. Those of us that have known him, that know him personally.. know his soul is one of us, even if his form is strange." She blushed a bit. "He's.. probably one of my best friends. And I trust him with my life." She nodded.

There was a pregnant pause for a good five minutes. No one dared speak. One of the other Family Leaders made a hoof signal, and Vincenzo nodded.

Vincenzo Corleone: "We wish to speak to each other privately." He nodded.

K: "We'll wait out there." I pointed to the office in the warehouse.

Elsie and I stood up, and walked over to the office, went in, and sat down.

Elsie: "Did.. I mess this up?" She looked at me with a frownie face of self-doubt.

K: "I think you said exactly what needed to be said, Elsie." I nodded. "YOU may think of me as a Pony, but they sure don't." I shrugged.

Deliberations took over an hour. I could hear very loud yelling, too. Finally, one of Corleone's goons came in and motioned for us to return to the table.

We did, and I sat back down.

Amarita Anellovillaggia: "General K." She nodded, having moved forwards so her face was visible. "You have the support of the Families." She looked at Vincenzo. "If what you say for Tirek's goals is true.. it is.. bad for business." She nodded solemnly at me. "Please.." She looked down. "..my sons are in the Legion." I saw a tear drip down her snout. "Spend their lives well."

K: "My lady.. I remember every face. Every face." I leaned over to her and gently placed a hand on her hoof. "I will.. as I always do.. treat them as though they were my own children." I looked at the rest of them, knowing I violated protocol. "One of my own will be joining me this year, in fact. My danger is yours."

Vincenzo Corleone: "We.. accept this." He blinked, and nodded.

Costenzo Minatore: "Go forth, General." He leaned into the light. "You have our blessing."

K: "I thank all of you." I nodded to them, as I rose. "I know that this choice isn't easy." I bowed to them, though not fully at the waist. "I will do everything in my power to justify the trust you all have shown in me."

Elsie: "Thank you all." She lowered her head as she stood up. "I can't tell you what this means to us."

With that, we quietly departed. Once again escorted to our pick-up point, I found Vy, Dex, Octavia, Redheart and Forest Spirit waiting for us.

Forest Spirit: "Well? How'd it go?" He nodded to me.

K: "Very well." I nodded back. "I have earned their trust - expect no work slowage, slacking, or quiet resistance to the war, from them."

Elsie: "It was very business-like." She nodded.

K: "Nothing like when Rarity and I met the mob boss of Manehattan." I shrugged. "Or that business in Las Pegasus."

Octavia: "Well, let's get back to the hotel, hm?" She shrugged a bit. "The hour grows late, and a lady does need her beauty rest." She smirked at us both, as she and Vy led the way.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Hippon

TIME: 08:22 CET
DATE: War Day 1024/22 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Marreterranian Sea, Departing Roam


The Roaman Fleet with Ceasar (CV), Impero, Senatus (BB), Alberto Guissano, Guiseppe Garibaldi (CA), Latium, Piemonte, Venetia, Lombardia (CL), Arezzo, Altamura, Carzano, Manciano (DD), Assisi, Civitanova, Forli, Magenta (FF), were in the lead of the formation.

Behind us was the Prench Fleet, with Jeanne d'Arc, Roland (CV), Normandie, Bretange (BB), Conde, Conti (CA), Seine, Loire (CL), Durandal, Joyeuse (DD), Spahi, Hussard, and Paladin (FF), were trailing behind us.

The lighter ships were forming a two-slash arc shield around the heavy units in the center - the Prench had the east side, the Roamans had the west. Even if The Storm King had shown ZERO ability towards anything beyond infantry, we were not taking any chances.

Landing craft were a mixture - the Prench sent three large converted cruise ships with adapted boat cranes on the sides, while the Roamans had a set of proper Landing Craft. The San Marco class of Landing Ships each held half a Regiment (3 companies). We had all six of them for this operation - more were being constructed, and San Michel herself was on her maiden voyage. This gave us over a battalion of troops from each country, as the warships also had troops embarked.

This would be more than enough. We were met by Admiral Seaspray about three quarters of the way there. He landed on the deck of Impero, which was serving as the Flagship.

He landed with not 24, but 30 Griffs.

Admiral Seaspray: "General K!" He marched forwards.

K: "There you are, friend." I leaned forward and embraced him. "This is my good friend, Giovanni Tortellini, the leader of the Roaman Navy." Technically true, as he was Chief of Operations, though the Legatus of Roam technically outranked him, he was the highest ranked and billeted Naval officer.

Gio: "Please! Please! Just Gio." He stepped forwards and hugged as well. "This is my wife, Contessa Tortellini." He bowed, presenting her.

She was.. very much showing. She really shouldn't be here, but she absolutely insisted.

Contessa Tortellini: "It is an honor." She nodded.

K: "And my two right hands - Commandant Forest Spirit, and General Phillipe Sacquet." I gestured to them both.

Sacquet: "Bonne chance, Mon Amis." He bowed to them.

Forest Spirit: "Hiyas!" He grinned.

Admiral Seaspray: "Let me introduce my volunteers." He nodded. "First of all, Duchess Silverstrea-"

Silver Stream: "JUST.. just Silver Stream." She blushed.

Admiral Seaspray: "There was an argument, K. Silver Stream, Skystar, and the other royal daughters all wanted to represent the Throne. It came down to the flip of a clamshell." He shrugged. "Anyway, this is Lieutenant Stratus Skyranger, my second in command." He nodded to him.

Stratus Skyranger: "General K." He nodded.

Admiral Seaspray: "And this.. is Terramar." He grunted. "Silver Stream's brother."

Terramar: "Heya!" He beamed a grin.

K: "How old are you?" I asked him directly.

Terramar: "Uhm.." He blushed a bit. "15?" He gave me 'begging eyes' that reminded me of Puss'n'Boots from Shrek. "I want to be there for my sister!"

Silver Stream: "Ahh.. yeeah.. about that." She shrugged. "Sorry, General. He insisted."

K: "I understand." I looked at them both. "You two seem to be the youngest, here. Be extra careful, and be EXTREMELY patient." I nodded to them.

Silver & Terramar: "Yes, General!" They nodded.

K: "Alright, Dusk, while we have time, get them all set up with gear and weapons instruction." I nodded. "We'll be a few days while we set up for the landing operation. Including practice with the boats - no one here has ever conducted a landing operation before."

Silver Stream: "Oooo.. sounds dangerous." She nodded.

K: "It is." I nodded back. "Seaspray, I leave you and your Grifs in the capable hooves of Dusk Seeker." I nodded.

Dusk Seeker: "Oh, I'll get them trained, General." He smirked. "By the by - we managed to put together enough Equestrian Marines from the ship's guards that survived the battle, to form two Platoons."

K: "Blinda?" I looked to her.

Blinda: "We're short on NCOs, but we have plenty of eager hooves." She smirked. "I'll lead them personally."

K: "Alright. Work with Dusk. The Equestrian Marines with the Hippogriffian Volunteers. Any of the Marines, veterans?" I nodded to her, as I saw Sigmask step out from behind her. "Oh, never mind." I smirked.

Sigmask: "Sir." He smirked back.

K: "You have enough." I nodded. "Sigmask, how's your team looking?"

Sigmask: "I want this one to take some extra training time." He shoved a sandy-yellow colored Stallion forwards. "He was fresh from Boot Camp when the operation started. I want to make sure he's sharp."

Sandbar: "Private Sandbar, General K." He nervously saluted.

K: "Get him fixed up. Blinda, your team and my team will go in first." I nodded. "Make certain they're ready."

Blinda: "Between me, Sigmask, and Dusk?" She smirked to him. "Oh we GOT this, K." She beckoned the newcomers. "Come along. Let's get some trigger time in."

This was about to get very interesting. I didn't realize it, but I was uniting creatures that would become friends.. and would have BEEN friends, if this war had never happened.

They just needed to survive it, now.

[End of Part 3]

Part 4: Liberation Initiation

TIME: 06:26 CET
DATE: War Day 1030/28 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Marreterranian Sea, Off the Coast of Hippogriffia


The Hippogriff Volunteer Platoon was as ready as it was going to get. They'd be intermixed with two platoons of Equestrian Marines, making almost a full company. Blinda would lead them directly. Forest Spirit would remain on the Fleet Flagship, Impero, while Sacquet would be aboard the Prench Flagship, Normandie. Both would be in constant communication and assign additional forces to the designated beaches as needed.

This was also to train the Prench and Roaman fleets on how to do landing operations. They had some experience at Neighpon, but this was different. Both sides hadn't any proper landing craft, and just used boats - very World War I style. Now, both sides had landing craft, though the Prench still lacked dedicated Landing Ships.

I was on the lead landing craft with the Volunteer team. Of course. A large number of CAG personnel were with me. Myself, Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Toola Roola, Sunset, Trixie, Steela, Norfy, Cosmic, Gaze, Dusk, Webley, Dex, Gilda, Cody, Teddy, Firecracker, Blizz, Lightning Dust, Broken, Golden, Rapid Bearing, Big Mac, Ochre, Dusty, Dawn, Olivine, Lyra, Bon-Bon, Coconut Cream, Octavia, Vinyl, Slapshot, and Elsie. 36 members, plus the 24 Marines, and the 30 Hippogriffs. Add in Seven Devils' foxes (another 6), and Havoc's Canidan Rangers (another 24) and that's exactly two companies.

We were mainly using Roaman weapons, as most of our gear had been lost with our fleet. While I could have had an Equestrian task force here already, I ordered them to remain at home - partly because our NEIGHTO allies desperately needed to get this experience by the seats of their saddles. No safety net with my highly trained, veteraned forces to save the day.

K: C> "Alpha Actual to Mike Actual." I said, sitting in the lander, looking back towards the Impero.

Forest Spirit: C> "Mike."

K: C> "Scout plane report."

Forest Spirit: C> "About two battalions or so of enemy forces. No sign of target designated Sierra Kilo. Significant magical energy has been detected in the area, however. Use caution. Preparatory air strikes are taking off now. Landers release in five."

K: C> "Roger that." I nodded to everyone in the lander. "Be just a bit, folks."

Rarity: "I do not relish having to climb over those beaches." She snorted a bit. "The sand in my coat will surely stain it." She flicked her tail under Dusk's chin.

Trixie: "No kidding! I just MADE this cape." She flicked her camouflage cape out. "Since my last one was ruined in Ambleion."

Sunset: "Everyone remember to keep it tight." She nodded. "These are mainly claw-to-hoof fighters."

Dusk: "..and I suppose I'll have to bathe you both." He snorted, playfully.

Trixie/Rarity: "OF COURSE!"

Everyone had a chuckle at that.

Dusk: "I'm getting too old for this. Too old, and too stiff." He beamed a cheesy grin.

Rarity: "That's what.."

Trixie: "..we're hoping for.."

Rarity: "..darling!"

They both gave huge, cheesy grins.

Everyone had a good, hard belly laugh at that one.

Forest Spirit: C> "This is Mike Command to all landing forces - ENGAGE!"

We felt the landing craft jerk free from its mooring against the San Marco, and lurch forwards.

Broken: "Not our first dance, everyone. Come on! We got this." He nodded.

Golden: "AYE!" He puffed his chest out.

Fluttershy: "Be careful." She nudged her coltfriend.

Golden: "Ah will." He nodded to her. "You, too."

I caught Brooken looking at a small picture of Mary. I patted him on the shoulder.

K: "Never forget what this is for." I said in low tones in his ear.

Broken: "Never. Never, K." He nodded.

Sunset: "FINAL WEAPONS CHECK! If you forgot something, it's too late, now!" She said, taking the leadership role.

It was good to see - she wasn't Twilight, but she knew how to run the Girls, after knowing them for six months. It was odd to think - this war began almost three years ago. And now..?

Applejack: "No incomin' fire from th' shoreline!" She reported.

K: "As expected. BE READY for ANYTHING." I reminded them.

I felt the landing craft slide againt the sand, and then watch the gate fall down. We charged forwards. No opposition. I could hear some sporadic gunfire from up the beach as other landing craft hit the beach, and other troops disembarked.

I moved with my other 11. No hurry, but we moved at a trot. For me, a very fast walk. I kept my Boaretta SAW close to my shoulder. It fit me well - it was a bit bigger than an M4 Carbine with the stock extended all the way, and I could take advantage of the longer barrel. I still had my Type-34 PDW on my thigh.

We climbed the beach cliff, and were almost immediately in the main city. Storm Guards were marching en masse towards us, but the nearest one was at least 70 meters distant.

K: "COVER! AND OPEN FIRE!" I ordered.

I braced the Bipod on the nearest stone wall, and started letting loose. Short, controlled bursts. 4-5 rounds each. Dusk got up next to me, with his borrowed Barnelli precision rifle, and started banging off shots. Each a hit, and a kill. Rarity moved on the far side of him and did likewise. AJ was next to me, with her Franchi shotgun - she was at max range with Sabot shells, but fired anyways. Trixie fell in on the far side of Rarity, with the Meowser/Franchi MMG, and started firing on FAST Automatic, hosing lines quickly, using her magic to stabilize the weapon.

We had them at range. This would be a slaughter. No reason to get close, no reason to risk it.

Blinda got her team on the far right flank from us, and I could see them opening fire - a company of Legion "Marines" were between us, and on my other side, Prench Fusiliers Marins.

We cut down two companies of the enemy in short order.

The advance of Storm Guards stopped, however, after that. I waited a few minutes.

K: C> "Alpha Actual to all callsigns - who has contact with the enemy?"

I waited for a response. Nothing.

K: C> "Bravo Mike. Alpha Team. Lima Alpha. Papa Alpha. Advance to contact. Tactical creep. Remaining Lima and Alpha, hold position and provide cover. Fox Actual - how copy?"

Sacquet: "Fox Actual. Nothing from scout planes, Alpha."

Forest Spirit: "Mike Actual. Same here."

K: C> "Hunter and Ares Actual - advance on Alpha's six."

Havoc: C> "Ten four, good buddeh."

We rose and advanced. Slow, at first, weapons up, and ready. I motioned for Blinda's team to converge with us.

Admiral Seaspray: "This is craziness, General. Where ARE they?!" He popped up, scanned, and popped down.

Blinda: "Recon said two battalions. We've taken two companies." She shrugged.

K: "Something's up." I frowned. "Silver Stream, Seaspray.. was the Storm King after anything other than the Pearl that might be able to destroy him?" I shrugged.

Admiral Seaspray: "I.. don't think so. No." He shrugged.

Silver Stream: "He can't go under the water." She shrugged. "That's why we turned into Seaponies in the first place."

K: "What if someone brought him what he wanted?" I gestured.

Applejack: "Who could have that kinda power, hun?" She nudged me.

K: "Well, really, the only other ones I could.." I blinked. I paused. C> "K to Katrina."

Katrina: C> "I'm here."

K: C> "Squirk and Crank. Sentient octopi and a lobster."

Katrina: C> "Yes, a-" A pause. "-you know, I betcha. I'm down the beach with La Boche. I'll be there."

K: C> "All callsigns, advance and sweep the ruins. Use caution, but I think the enemy has withdrawn." I looked at Admiral Seaspray. "Ever hear of Squirk and Crank? Or sentient sea life besides yourselves?"

Admiral Seaspray: "Huh. No, no, I can't recall.." He shrugged.

Katrina was by my side in short order. She was hefting a Roaman SMG.

Katrina: "So.. no Storm Guards." She nodded. "You're thinking Tirek unleashed another ancient evil.. right? Something or someone that can get the Pearl away from the Hippogriffs?"

K: "Yep." I nodded.

Katrina: "And Tirek would do.. what, then?" She shrugged.

K: "Draw the Storm King out and eliminate him under the pretense of forming an alliance against us." I nodded. "He's at least equal to Tirek's raw power, and he'd be a real thorn in Tirek's side if he wanted to be. It's clear they were both working to opposite ends in the Griffon Kingdom. Tirek wanted them as soldiers - the Storm King just wanted their land, and maybe keep them as slaves."

Sunset: "That makes sense." She nodded.

Admiral Seapsray: "And the Pearl is exactly the bait they'd want." He scowled. "When you said Tirek was a threat to us even underwater, I get it.. I get it, now." He nodded. "What do we do?"

K: "Tirek will meet the Storm King on his level, in his domain. We head for your palace. Select team. Sunset, gather up the girls. Norfy! Cosmic! Gaze! Dusk, you, too. GILDA! GET OVER HERE! Kat, you're in. Trixie, too. Broken, Golden, and Dusty." I started motioning for my select team. "Admiral? Pick your best." I nodded.

Admiral Seaspray: "Lieutenant Skyranger." He nodded.

Silver Stream: "You'll need me, too." She frowned slightly.

Admiral Seaspray: "Alright." He nodded.

Terramar: "And if she goes, I go." He puffed out his chest.

Admiral Sespray: "Alright!" He surrendered. "On you, General." He nodded to me.

If I was right, we might get there just in time to chase Tirek off. AND have him kill the Storm King FOR us! That alone would be a great victory.

I didn't expect what happened next, however.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Unexpected Betrayal?

TIME: 08:11 CET
DATE: War Day 1030/28 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Capital City, Hippogriffia


We made our way to the palace. It was a nice palace, and there were clear signs of a battle here. Old signs. From about 30 years ago. Dead husks and skeletons all over the place.

Admiral Seaspray: "..we fought hard." He picked up an old guard's helmet.

Havoc: "No one's doubting that." He put a paw on his shoulder. "These things? I don't think even us being dogs.. would help all that much."

Sgt. O'Fang: "No kiddin' - these're a tough lot." He frowned.

K: "Keep it tight. Havoc, take your team and cover us here." I pointed.

Havoc: "You got it, pal." He patted my shoulder.

We advanced into the ruins. I had no idea what I'd find, here, but almost instantly, everyone shuddered.

Sunset: "..he's fucking here." She growled.

K: "Girls. Jewelry." I said in hushed tones.

We got closer to the throne room, and I could hear voices.

Storm King: "AS YOU CAN SEE! Great Tirek.. I have indeed brought the prizes."

Tirek: "You have! I'm shocked. I didn't think a New Worlder could pull it off. I am suitably impressed."

Storm King: "So. This.. temporary alliance."

Tirek: "We have a mutual enemy - the human and his.."

Storm King: "..giant army?"

Tirek: "Something like that. Mine is much larger, and yours isn't insignificant, either. Combined, we could crush him. After that.."

Storm King: "After THAT.."

There was a pause.

Tirek: *Frustrated sigh* "COME ON OUT, HUMAN! I CAN HEAR YOU BREATHING!"

We entered in tactical crabwalk, weapons raised, 360 scan. The Storm King had Queen Novo and the Pearl up by her old throne. Tirek was standing nearby. As was several of his Royal Guards - giant lizard men, essentially. They were never named in the series.

K: "Tirek." I respectfully nodded. "Storm King. I see you're taking me seriously, now?" I had my weapon at medium-high ready, not aimed at either of them.

Storm King: "WELL OF COURSE!" He snorted. "After all, you managed to turn my top lieutenant from me. With nothing more than the power of friendship! It's not like you even MATED her!"

K: "Did you?" I tilted my head, looking at him.

Storm King: "..DO I LOOK LIKE SOME KIND OF DEGENERATE?!" He bellowed, bellicose. "Do I look like a horse mater?! That's bestiality! That's GROSS!" He spat.

ALL OF THE GIRLS LOOKED AT HIM, WITH LUSTY GAZES.

Sunset: "See, he's fucked each one of us." She slid a wing over Fluttershy.

Fluttershy gave a smug look, for once in her life.

Rarity: "Indeed, dahling.." She spat that out. "..you should open your mind and heart to love."

Applejack: "AN' HE'S MAH HUSBAND!" She hissed. "Degenerate!? Yew hate filled monster. Yew gots NO IDEA how good love is. Degenerate. Pfooey." She snarled. "I'm gonna take this here shotgun an' shove it up your nose!"

K: "Tirek." I nodded to him. "We want the Pearl and Queen Novo."

Tirek: "I've yet to strike a deal." He shrugged. "I'll.." He looked at the Storm King. "..if you don't have the strength to make a dent in the Human and his friends, your offer of alliance is unworthy." He stepped back. "Go on. Be warned, if you start losing, Human.. I will join in with everything I have." He grinned.

This was a challenge for both of us.

I drew the Sword of Rainbow's Light.

Storm King: "Mmm.. were I in your shoes, I'd say the same thing!" He chuckled. "Alright, then." He looked over to me.

Before he could start, though, the rest of my team had weapons raised, and simply hosed him down. Full automatic fire. Emotionless dispatch of a great foe that was ready to kill us. I stood there, holding my sword, staring at the ungodly, bloody, saturated mess that was once the Storm King's body. HUNDREDS of 7mm NEIGHTO rounds tore CHUNKS out of him. Trixie expended a full sized 240rd belt on Fast Automatic (1200 rounds per minute), dumping the whole thing in 12 seconds. Then a second.

There were VERY FEW fliers.

The Storm King remained standing either from shock, or sheer force of will, for a full 30 seconds of firing. Then, what was LEFT of him, fell in a giant lump on the ground.

Everyone reloaded, and turned to face Tirek, stone faced.

Tirek: "..." He blinked, and started snickering. "Ohh... BAHAHAHHHAHAHAHAHHAHHA! THAT WAS THE MOST PATHETIC THING I'VE EVER SEEN!" He pointed at the bloody mess. "YOU MISERABLE FOOL! YOU DIDN'T THINK THE HUMAN WOULDN'T JUST SHOOT YOU!? OH! BUT YOU'RE DEAD, NOW, AREN'T YOU!? AHAHAHAHAH! AHAAAAAAAAAHAHHAAHHAA! AHAH-*COUGH-COUGH*-AHHHHhh.." He wiped the tears of mirth fromh is eyes. "Oh. Human. That was so good. Thank you." He smiled at me. "Make no mistake, one day, I will kill you and your friends. But, for today? I let you go! That was TOO hilarious! Bahaha.." He shook his head, flicked his wrist, and teleported away.

Applejack: "..and thayt's how we do things dahwn in Ponyville." She putt a fist to her hip, smirked, and leaned up, grabbing me, and kissing me. "Mmm. Mah husband."

Dusk: "That was.. unexpected." He shrugged.

Silver Stream: "Aunt Nova!" She dashed up to the throne and got her aunt untied.

Queen Novo: "Ah, my darling niece! And K! You saved me! AND the Pearl!" She nodded, and reached out to the Pearl and used its magic to transform into a Hippogriff.

Broken: "That was't the battle I'd thought it'd be." He shrugged.

Golden: "Blighter didn't know about usin' magic t'stop bullets. Means.."

K: "It means, Science fucked him." I smirked. Hadn't said THAT in a while! It felt good.

Queen Novo: "General. If NEIGHTO would have us, you have my unquestioned support." She nodded, getting on her feet.

K: "Queen Novo, it would be an honor to have your brave Hippogriffs among our gang of friends." I nodded.

And so, the battle was ended. When the Storm King died, so did his minions. Soon, the Hippogriffs would move in to their old home again. They would join NEIGHTO. We would have more friends, and we would win this war.

We just needed time.

We had the friends, and as I always say, Friendship is Magic.
