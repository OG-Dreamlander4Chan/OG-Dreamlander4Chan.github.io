Part 1: Fields of Green

TIME: 08:32 ERDT
DATE: War Day 670/4 Secundus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Ponyville, Erie, Kingdom of Equestria

Today, I was helping with the early spring planting. Given that Equestria was a largely agriculturally-based society, about as much as America was in 1940 or earlier, significant energy had to be expended to maintain food production.

I didn't want them engaging in the use of chemical fertilizers. I had my reasons.

So, I turned the production of war machinery to farming. Automation and reduction in physical labor needs would both increase crop production and allow more Ponies to be freed up for service. Either in the military, or in Governmental Service at an Arsenal, or uniform production, or myriad other heavy industry needed to keep the Equestrian War Machine running and functioning.

Today.. I was rolling out our first large farm tractors that ran on Diesel Fuel.

K: "Mister Wheatley, it's with great pleasure I give you the first off the line." I patted the Deer Model 1 Tractor as it was rolled off a military supply truck.

Stalk Wheatley: "Well, K! I can't thank you enough!" He chuckled.

Ambrosia and her Engineers were putting the finishing touches on a Diesel tank.. a good distance from his buildings, just in case.

K: "The manual is pretty simple." I nodded to it. "It wasn't too long ago, my family were driving things like these. A few still are." I shrugged.

Stalk: "Ah, yes! I remember you mentioning your family were farmers, once." He nodded.

K: "With this Tractor, you'll be able to farm your entire acreage, minus the fallow, easily. And even with the maintenance, you'll still have extra time in the day." I nodded, and gestured.

His family had one of the larger wheat farms in the region, but ever since his brother up and quit farming to pursue his dreams of being a lounge singer in Las Pegasus, he hadn't been able to farm even a third of it. The Tractor promised to solve that issue.

Stalk: "Sounds fine." He was perusing the manual. "A'hmm.. seems I can use this for all kinds of things!"

K: "Yup. The Model 1 is designed to be a jack of all trades. You can use it to pull the tillers, or attach the drill kit to drill a new well, attach the machinery packet and do all kinds of maintenance.." One of the cooler things the Machinery Packet had on it, was a multi-belt sharpener for all kinds of farm tools, from the humble kitchen knife to scythes. "..the churner can be used like.. ah, we called them Washing Machines in my world. Or, churn butter."

Stalk: "This is amazing." He nodded. "And you came up with this?"

K: "Kinda? It uses the drive train and controls of the upcoming M-3 Buford series of Tanks, but stripped down and reconfigured into a Farm Tractor with multiple uses. The different attachments weren't my idea - I have to pass that along to Long Deer. His company made my basic ideas a reality." I shrugged.

Stalk: "Amazing." He nodded. "And this'll cut down on manual labor a ton, too."

K: "Yup. Diesel will be commercially available in probably eight to ten months, depending on a few things, but until then, we'll make sure to top off your tank whenever you need it."

We worked out a temporary and decreasing Government subsidy to get Tractors in the fields of farmers. For the first year after the war, he'd pay very little for the fuel. The next year, the subsidy decreased by half, so they can figure out and adjust their prices. The third year, half again, to help the market ride out the price adjustments, and then in the fourth year, it ended.

Market forces alone would dictate the price of fuel. While I did warn Celestia - and Toola Roola - that this meant more pollution, this also meant the advancement of Pony society. Working towards purer and higher quality fuels that didn't cost a lot, was vital. Pollution would be necessary, but we would work hard to minimize it.

Part of that also meant planting! Applejack brought up the new bushes for Stalk.

Applejack: "Uncle Stalk!" She gave him a hug - their farms were close, and she'd known him since she was a foal.

Stalk: "Ahhh! There's my niece!" He hugged back.

Applejack: "These here bushes.. y'all plant'em on the edge'a yer property, and it'll scrub a lotta the smoke'n pollution from the Tractor outta the air. Came from the Crystal Kingdom! They use 'em around where they test their airships'n stuff." She nodded to them. "Plus, they make real purty flowers.. an' the berries from 'em make a good jam." She cleared her throat. "Also a lil' Mountain Lightnin'." She wiggled her brow at him.

I couldn't help but laugh.

K: "Applejack knows a thing or two about that." I shrugged.

Stalk: "Oooo! Hafta try THAT!" He smiled.

K: "The best part is, if you distill the berries, you can actually run your Diesel truck on the distillate." I nodded. "It won't get nearly as good mileage, BUT, it's a good substitute and a good way to keep your fuel costs down. That's one of the nice things about Diesel. The engines can run on anything from vegetable oil, to kerosene.. you just have to scrub them out good and do more maintenance on them if you use cheaper fuel."

Stalk: "Flexible!" He chortled. "Lotta us farmer's've been hearin' them legends, K. Far as I'm concerned, this is all saving the world, t'me." He grinned. "Why, with this, I can triple my wheat production.."

K: "Which will allow the military to source more wheat without a burden being placed on the People." I glanced to him. "And, after the war, you can till only as much land as you need, to keep up with the Market."

Stalk: "The spare time alone, I'll get.." He gave a short nod. "I'll be able to get to all them Honey Do's I got saved up!"

Applejack: "It'll make Aunt Seedly real happy." She beamed a grin.

Stalk: "Sure enough!" He chuckled again. "So! When's the due date?"

K: "About the 19th of Quartus." I nodded. "You know we want another after this."

Stalk: "Ohh? Sure enough! Haha. Gotta have a mess a kids, right?" He beamed.

K: "Yep." I nodded. "Hey, uh.. Nephew to Uncle.." I said, my tone going from Neighborly to personal.

Stalk: "Shoot." He nodded firmly.

K: "Something happens to me.." I shrugged a bit. "..maybe I don't make it back, maybe I get SENT back by magic or whatever.."

Stalk: "Say no more, K." He patted my shoulder. "I'll make sure your kids're well cared for."

Applejack: "Shore do appreciate it, Uncle." She nodded, her tone more personable. "Rolfe especially. He'll need good, strong father figures.. or Great Uncles." She smiled a bit.

Stalk: "We're family. Tis' how we do, yeah? I was there for Mac as much as I could be." He nodded.

Applejack: "And he shore do appreciate it." She said, in low tones.

K: "Well, now that we've got that settled.." I nodded to Ambrosia. "You done over there?"

Ambrosia: "Sure am!" She grinned. "The fuel truck'll be done in a bit. Make SURE you read the manual - last thing you want is fuel all over the place." She nodded to him.

Stalk: "All the time, Misus Beam." He nodded to her.

K: "Alright, let's go. Come on - we'll have brunch at Rose's. My treat!" I said, in a chipper tone.

Not all the things in war revolve around bullets. The 'beans' in Bullets, Beans, and Bandages have to come from somewhere. As the Tractor Program began across Equestria and elsewhere, we shored up another section of our Logistics. And Logistics win wars.

Food production would increase dramatically, and that meant we could also give food AID, when we inevitably liberated parts of Tirek's homeland, that barely had enough to not-starve on, I was sure. Every stalk of grain that grew, was a bullet against Tirek.

Part 2: The Art(istry) of War

TIME: 13:47 ERDT
DATE: War Day 670/4 Secundus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Toola Roola's Studio, Ponyville, Erie, Kingdom of Equestria

We entered after lunch, and found Toola painting away at a small canvas. She was so entranced with her painting, she didn't notice me and Applejack coming in.

K: "Toola?" I asked at her.

Toola: "..." She stared intently, as she painted.. and then waved a hoof at us, letting us know we were acknowledged. "Jus'sec."

We shrugged at each other, and found a place to sit, as she painted.

After.. oh.. about half an hour! We.. who had been cuddling.. cleared our throats at the same time.

Toola: "Almost done." She said, distractedly.

After another ten minutes, she got more animated, and then..

Toola: "AHA!" She spun around and presented her latest masterpiece.

It was a propaganda poster, only, about the size of a photograph. It depicted a few stalks of wheat growing out of the ground, seeing the seeds in the center of the picture, tilted towards an image of Tirek. The tips of the seeds facing him, were bullets.

"EVERY STALK - A BULLET AGAINST THE ENEMY!"

The color scheme reminded me very much of the 1940's - the background was a medium-dark blue, the banner at the bottom was white, with red letters. There was flashy yellow-gold in there, too.

K: "That's amazing, Toola!" I blinked.

Toola: "I had help!" She beamed, but nodded. "The actual art is mine, I just.." She shrugged. "I.. asked Webley if your world ever did inspirational art stuffs for that big war you mentioned. Then.. haha.. she had a vision. I found out I can tap into them! Er.. when it's art related, that is. I can see what she's seeing!" She puffed up her chest a bit. "So, what'cha think?"

K: "I think the Office of Wartime Information will purchase a few thousand prints of this." I nodded. "It's amazing."

Toola: "Hey.. besides hefting a Ridgway, I wanted to do my part!" She gave a full beaming grin. "I mean, my Special Talent IS art, after all." She paced over to Applejack. "Chaperone?"

Applejack: "Mmm.." She smirked at her. "..kinda."

K: "Ah.. on a.. more personal note-"

Applejack: "Jes' wantin' t'let'cha know, yer fine to play in the Paddock any time." She fixed her with a gaze. "As'n if ya wasn't aware." She shrugged.

K: "It also means you have a duty to protect my Monkey Ass from other Mares.. of many species." I shrugged. "Should you and I ever be out without any of the other girls."

Toola: "Oh, I did that already." She nodded. "K's birthday. You know Julienne La Selle wanted that Monkey Sex God Dick? UN-prepared?" She giggled.

Applejack: "Oh, REALLY?" She shot me a 'you're in trouble' look. "UN-prepared, ya'say?" She giggled right back. "She'd've never been fit fer Legionnaire duty ever ag'n!"

K: "HONEY!" I blushed.. BLUSHED! "I'm not.. THAT good!" I lowered my head a bit.

Toola: "Ohh, K, dear.. to us? You are." She gave me a peck on the cheek. "I will say.. I'm not nearly as.." She shrugged. "Horny for Banana as.. say.. Rarity is." She nodded at me. "It's good stuff, yeah. And I love the comfy feeling afterwards, but to me.. well.. I just plain love sex." She pecked Applejack on the cheek. "It's nothing like YOU and him. Oh, no, no.. that's a true work of art all on its own." She nodded back to me. "It's more.. I love the physical, the emotional is good, but it's.. more.. a friend thing?" She tilted her head, but shook it dismissively. "Still, I know the Paddock's closed to newcomers without explicit permission.. I don't mind gate guarding."

Applejack: "Mmmmm.. ya love sex, huh?" She swayed her head this way and that, a seductive look in her eye.

Toola: "Oh, yeah. I've banged Zebras, Donkeys, several Stallions.." She was pacing over to her art stand. "..I've been with Mares before.."

And Applejack slid up behind her.. giving her a bit of a hug.

Toola: "Oohhh.. Applejack! In front of your husband!?" She was pretending to be shocked.

K: "Honey, are you starting something? Or is this just a reassuring sort of.. mutual grooming thing..?" I tilted my head, my tone almost mockery.

Applejack: "Depends on if'n mah dear husband wants a lil' fun with our Artsy good friend here.." She trilled, lustily.

I shrugged, stood up, and started unzipping.

K: "Why the heck not? We need some Friend Time, anyhow. And I want a good look at that Propaganda Art when we're done with you, Toola." I smirked.

Toola: "Mmmm.. my body, YOUR canvas." She slid her forelegs back a bit, to embrace Applejack's. "Been a WHILE since I had a good threesome.."

Threesomes with married couples, rock.

TIME: 15:27 ERDT

I was looking through several Propaganda Posters that Toola had done already, and I was very impressed with her mastery of the art form. Given that her special talent is ART.. specifically, graphical art, it was fascinating to see her shift from "traditional portrait art" to something like this, instantly, and so effectively.

Really, Cutie Marks were amazing things. Recognizing talent, and enhancing it.

The two mares were kinda cuddled together in Toola's messy bed. Not that it wasn't messy when I got there, it was just MORE messy, now. I looked around, and realized that Toola really wasn't used to living in a house.

This house had actually belonged to Berry Punch.. with her death, her parents sold it, the Government bought it, and more or less gave it to Toola. As she was a Staff Officer, she WAS drawing a salary, and so, the Government would be paid back..

..the economy needed to move, after all.

I was taking note of which Posters would look the best around different parts of Equestria, and writing notes about how we could auction off signed ones, too. I'd use that as a back door way to repay the Government's expenditures.

Really, we were very fortunate that Equestria, being on the Gold Standard, had hoarded free Gold in the economy, to maintain a high level of relative value. Expenditures for the war, weren't depressing that value, since the money kept moving. Just, on larger scales.

Still. It was on my mind. I let AJ and Toola sleep.. I'd worn them out pretty hard. And I went into the other rooms of the house, and picked up for her. I noted that she kept her uniforms clean, but other things.. not so much. She just wasn't used to the "settled down" life. I wondered how long she'd really been wandering?

After filling a laundry basket, I took it to the local Laundry, and paid for it to be done, telling them where to deliver it. I returned to see that the girls had gone from "post-sex dozing" to "we sleep nao." That was fine. I cleaned up Toola's kitchen, and made notes that, while she did keep SOME food in the house, very little of it needed to be "cooked" more than one or two steps. Quick oats, vegetables, peanut butter, things like that. A few eggs, too, and some cheese. She had a jar of olive oil, for cooking with, and three quarters of a pound of butter.

It was interesting to see how a single Mare kept her kitchen, given that she had a far more Veganish diet than any of the other girls, even Fluttershy.

I hopped out to the Market, while I was at it, and got her some things I knew she ate. Pasta, bread, things like that. I also got her a pack of gum.. just because the wrapper looked interesting. I restocked her larder, and checked the time.

TIME: 17:44 ERDT

Eh, may as well have dinner, here. I boiled the pasta, added butter, and garlic. She'd ordered this at Rose's once, so, I knew she ate it. I didn't mind having a Vegan/Vegetarian meal. Well, TRUE Vegan would have been zero butter, but she was like most Ponies - a Lacto-Ovo Vegetarian, but she was very choosy about her Lacto's and Ovo's. I added garlic bread to the meal, and made up a small Garden Salad.. set the plates and bowls out.. and woke them up.

K: "Hey.. dinner!" I prodded Toola's butt.

Toola: "Hmmhm?!" She sat up. "GOSH! What time is it?!"

K: "Oh.. a bit after six." I got a kiss from my wife as she leaned up.

Applejack: "Ah smell Dinner aw'lright." She nudged Toola out of bed. "C'mon, the Stallion done made us grub."

Toola: "Oh! Garlic butter noodles, garlic bread, and salad!" She giggled. "Well, no more kissing tonight!"

K: "Thought I'd do something special, considering how much you've always done for us." I shrugged.

Toola: "Thanks, K." She smiled. "I better find me a stallion that can cook like you can." She nodded to Applejack. "You lucky mare."

Applejack: "Oh, I knows it." She smiled warmly at me.

A calm dinner with a friend, and my wife.. at least I could enjoy some moments along the way.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Steeled Work

TIME: 06:33 ERDT
DATE: War Day 674/8 Secundus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Manehattan Naval Yards, Erie, Kingdom of Equestria

While Fillydelphia was the primary Navy Yard, and Baleston was Equestria's #2, I wanted several more yards created, both as a 'just in case' against Tirek, and to distribute the work of multiple types of Navy requirements across several Yards.

Manehattan would be the primary Maintenance and Repair Yard for the Middle Sea Fleet. They'd relieve Fillydelphia of the need to house all the Fleet's maintenance and repair slipways, so they could be used for construction. Thing is, the current "naval yard" here in Manehattan was totally unsuited to the task..

K: "Commodore Yardley!" I called to the Yard Commander.

Commodore Harick Yardley was a Griffon, another of the Griffon fishing commuinities that we'd hired on at the start of the war. Yardley was an expert in ship construction and maintenance - once taking on the task of rebuilding one of the largest fishing vessels on the coast, by hand. It took him 32 months, but he did it. Alone.

CDRE Yardley: "Bah! General K!" He paced over. "You got my message."

K: "I did." I shrugged. "What's the deal?" I nodded to my side. "Rarity Belle, Naval Advisor."

CDRE Yardley: "Ah, Miss Rarity." He bowed slightly.

Rarity: "Mm.. a pleasure, Commodore." She nodded sweetly to him.

CDRE Yardley: "Well, part of my issue is.. I can't expand the slipways!" He snorted. "The six we have are large enough for A-Class Corvettes, and maybe a Unicorn-class Frigate.." He sighed.

Yes, after the destruction, loss, or sale of the lead ship of a class, the class's name designation is changed to the next-oldest commissioned ship in that class - in this case, HMS Unicorn.

K: "But?" I tilted my head.

CDRE Yardley: "I'm having to work with civilian contractors. I don't have enough Navy personnel." He nodded sharply to the slipways. "The company I hired says they can't do the work! Not without this or that.. it changes all the time." He growled.

K: "Ohhh-hoh-hoh-hooo!" I laughed. "They want a BRIBE, man!" I patted him on the shoulder.

CDRE Yardley: "Is THAT what it is?!" He was furious. "There's a WAR on!" He grumbled. "By gum, if they think they can extort ME-"

K: "Which is exactly why I'll deal with them." I smirked smugly. "Come, Rarity.. time to show you how we deal with things.. The Chicago Way."

Rarity: "OOoooo.. K! Darling! Am I going to see you get DASTARDLY?" She slithered a little, then giggled. "This should be fun."

With that, I walked on over to Slipway #1, which should have been ready months ago, but was barely started on. I examined the crowd.. several Donkeys, a few Zebras.. some Griffons.. aha! A pony in a much nicer shirt and pants than he needs. I paced right up to him.

K: "Bon Giorno." I nodded to him, in flawless Italian.. er.. Roaman.

Mob Pony: "Ahhh! You must be K!" He bowed. "So good ta make yer acquaintence, sur!"

K: "Don't mock me, son." I grew more reserved. "I want words with your boss's boss." I pulled out some Palm Grease - B500 - and slipped the coins in his pocket. "Sending messengers is expensive these days. I'll be at the Greenpacket Clarion Hotel."

He patted the Bits, looking at them with a bit of admiration, but before he could say anything, I twirled a finger around his collar and gold chain.

K: "You fuck with me, they'll be fishing your parts out of the bay at Carousel Island." I looked him right in the eyes. "You're barely an Associate pretending to be a big man." I put a finger from my free hand between his eyes. "I know the game. You're not even a pawn in it. We clear?"

Mob Pony: "Y-Yeah! Real clear!" He corrected himself, and I let him disengage my grasp, so he wouldn't lose too much respect from his crew.

K: "I expect a messenger before dinner." I nodded very slightly to him, and paced away.

Once we were out of earshot, Rarity giggled at the display.

Rarity: "Oh, K.. Darling, that was so macho.." She gently rubbed against my hip.

K: "Mob business. I just demonstrated I can DO business." I shrugged.

Rarity: "MMmm.. and are we going to just wait around the hotel?" She was going to give me puppy dog eyes, but I already had the Royal Credit Card out. "OH!" She grinned. "Bribery? For me?"

K: "Rarity, if you want a little fun, I never need to bribe you." I smirked. "This is for me. I want to see what happens when you go nuts." I nodded firmly.

Famous last words.

TIME: 14:47 ERDT
LOCATION: Greenpacket Clarion, Manehattan, Erie, Kingdom of Equestria

I was lugging at least 35 kilos (over 75lbs) of shopping over my slowly-bending back. And we had two hired helpers with almost as much between them. We'd just finished her 'shopping spree.' And it was almost as expensive as my date with Applejack in Manehattan over a year ago.

To be fair, a lot of it was raw materials for crafting new clothes, and at least some of it was for me. The rest of it were clothes for her. And shoes. And hats. And.. unmentionables. And to this point, I hadn't really realized what a 'luxury' good they really were.

Given that a lot of Ponies rarely wear full outfits, and my times with Rarity involved her - if wearing anything - being in stockings and the Pony equivalent of a Teddy or something, with.. ah.. free access.. I didn't really recall seeing her in underware.

Let alone THIS kind. Hoo!

Now, I know she had some Slips and things, she wore as a boundary layer beneath her Naval Attache uniform and other outfits, but this was genuine close-ended undies (with a tail hole or tail notch). Some of it.. got the motor running. Others looked fairly plain.

I got to the desk and dropped (CAREFULLY) the bags.

Manager, Swifty Markets: "AH! General K." He nodded to me. "Your room is ready. Floor 14, Room 24, the Executive Suite, as requested." He passed me the key.

K: "I need a small army of Bellhops for all these packages and things. Have I any mesages?" I shrugged, as Swifty clopped his hooves together to summong the Bellhops.

Swifty Markets: "Ah.. yes. About thirty minutes ago, a messenger came by with this." He handed me a folded, sealed envelope.

Rarity: "I'll get these to the room, Darling." She nodded.

I moved over to the Message Desk (small little alcoves for writing and reading messages in private) and carefully broke the wax seal, opening the letter.

As expected, it was a dinner invitation. A place to discuss "business" away from prying eyes. Santino's Roaman Restaurant, 40-22 108th Street, Queens.

At least he agreed to the meet.

I wrote two messages. One to Clement Orange, and one to Chief Paddy O'Bogs of the Manehattan Gendarmes. Chief O'Bogs was asked to attend a dinner I was holding at that address. The one to Clement was a request for the Manehattan and Long Island Ranger Company to infiltrate the area and set up for a raid.

I was taking no chances. Not after Las Pegasus.

Clement's message was sent to him by one of Cara's sisters. The message to Chief O'Bogs by a Gendarmes pony.

Rarity and I had a few hours..

TIME: 16:44

Rarity: "..mmm, I think this one looks better, though.."

And every minute was spent with her showing off her new fashion.

Most men would be bored to tears.

I am... exactly like most men in that regard.

Especially since I was kinda horny, looking at her in some of those outfits, and desperately wanting to rip them to shreds and plow that marshmallowy tush.

But, no.. no.. she wanted to show off.

Realize, my J-- was not like this in the slightest. Her idea of "high fashion" was low-cut cowboy boots, clean jeans, and a shirt with buttons on it. Her typical wear was sweatpants and t-shirts. And I was JUST FINE with that.

K: "Rarity, make a choice, okay? We need to go - and make sure you can conceal your Morgan." I nodded. "Sorry, Rares.. I mean, some of those outfits were hot, but I can only take so much of you just showing off."

Rarity: "OH! Oh.. Darling, I'm so sorry.. you must have a horrible case of blueballs." She giggled with a flirty wink. "I should have made this Fashion Show with a bit.. more.. audience participation." She gave me a lusty grin. "Problem is, darling, I wanted you to ravage me in.. JUST the right outfit." She said, warmly.

K: "Aww.." I went over and hugged her tightly.

It wasn't just sex, really. Rarity enjoyed some of the romance that went with it. Some of the intrigue. The delightfully taboo idea that I was 'having an affair' on Applejack, and enjoying it. Even if AJ long ago approved.

Rarity: "The black one. For sure. It has the longest tail." She nodded, and slithered into it.

The dress she spoke of was closer to a Pony equivalent of a Lounge Singer's dress. Naughty, but conservative, with a long tail that went to her rear ankle. It went with a jacket-like shawl that had.. partial.. sleeves? They covered the fronts of her forelegs, not the rear, and were secured by a pair of slip-through cloth rings at the wrist.

She put those and a pair of mid-length black heels on that pushed her ass up deliciously.. and because she'd seen my reaction to underware, a pair of black slightly lacy undies underneath.

We caught a carriage to the local trolley station, and took the trolley to Queens. I found it interesting that this "Manehattan" was closer to 1890's to 1910's New York City than anything else. The subway existed, but it was limited in its reach, and didn't go between Boroughs.

Arriving at the street before the Restaurant, we disembarked. I saw Clement over by his personal carriage, in formal duds, about to patronize the same restaurant.

I also saw that his 'driver' was actually his son's friend, Sergeant Ride Off, and that murder presents were secured in the carriage.

Crafty society fuck that he is.. I was glad I had an uncle like this.

We went in - with me not acknowledging Clement - and I immediately picked which table was ours as I helped Rarity with her shawl off. The booth at the back.. the Chief was already here, and through at least one pint of suds..

Part 4: Godfathers

TIME: 18:01 ERDT
DATE: War Day 674/8 Secundus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Santino's, Queens, Manehattan

I approached the table, and gently bowed to the fattest pony in the booth.

K: "Thank you for seeing me on such short notice." I locked eyes with him..

..he adjusted himself in the booth, and nodded to me.

Don Francino: "General K! I am.. Francino Tagliatelle." He gestured to a chair.

K: "Don Francino." I bowed fully, and pulled a chair out for Rarity, not taking my eyes off of him. "This is my Naval advisor, Rarity Belle."

Don Francino: "A pleasure, my lady." He didn't take his eyes off of me, either.

I sat once Rarity was seated, and picked up a menu.

K: "So, what are we having this evening, Gentlecolts?" I deliberately ignored business.

You do NOT start in with Business, when invited to dinner, before eating. The consumption of food is, in itself, part of the act - it shows that the host, while they could try to poison the guest, chooses not to, out of respect. It also shows the Guest trusts the Host.

My speaking up like that, also indicated that I'd pay for the meal, if permitted.

Don Francino: "Don't worry! This dinner is on me." He gestured. "Order whatever you like!" He smiled.

That was two things, there. One, it acknowledged that I was offering to pay and perhaps slip a quiet fixed rate bribe through that way - meaning he wanted to negotiate. Two, it was him being a gracious host. I would be expected to pick from the top four most pricey items on the menu, but not THE most expensive one, to acknowledge his gesture, AND show I'm not taking advantage of it.

Oooo.. lamb chops in lamb sauce.. perfect. Second most expensive, too.

Rarity: "I believe I'll have the.. Chicken Alfredo, Deluxe, with the Crystal Greens side salad." She picked the third most expensive one - Crystal Greens being an imported item from the Crystal Kingdom.

K: "The lamb chops." I nodded, after appearing to think it over some. "It's been a bit since I've had lamb." I gave the Don a small smile.

The waiter was over there before Rarity even finished her sentence.

Rarity: "The Pinoir Grigio." She handed the finely printed menu over.

K: "Coffee." I bowed my head graciously to the Don. "I don't imbibe, sir."

Which.. is bordering on an insult, but possibly forgivable because of my Alien nature. Getting a bit buzzed "together" is part of the whole song and dance we were doing - part of the ceremony of it. Alcohol.. it relaxes the tongue and allows one's true feelings to come out, or so it was thought. It.. enhanced honesty.

Don Francino: "Understandable.. you have so many.. ah.. responsibilities.." He gestured.

And right there, it was forgiven, as an excuse for me was made, and so frail-ly, that it was clear Don Francino expected me to say that.

I also noticed that HE noticed that I somehow seemed to know how to play this game. To take part in this ceremony respectfully. He seemed a bit surprised at it. Apparently, the gravity of my upbringing was not known by him.

Maybe THIS is why I, specifically, was chosen? It might be hard pressed to find another human that understood and respected war as I did, that planned as I did, AND had the knowledge and understanding to navigate a Mafia Dinner Event like this, that had exposure to "dirty politics," Mafia style. And understood the rules.

The food was excellent. I have to say, it absolutely WAS well made, and worth the price. Even Rarity was extremely pleased with her dish. The coffee was a Prench roast of some kind, and tasted excellent.

As we finished - and, realize, while I enjoyed the flavor, I made sure to finish somewhat quickly - I made sure to pay respects and compliments.

K: "Don Francino, that was.. magnificent!" I nodded to the Waitstaff. "My compliments to the Chef. That was the best Lamb I've had in twenty years - even beat out human chefs."

The Waitstaff nervously slid back towards the kitchen and passed this along.

Don Francino: "Miss Rarity?" He inquired with a raised glass.

Rarity: "Absolutely fantastic, darling. The chicken was just right, the pasta perfectly al dente, and the Crystal Greens so fresh, I would swear they were still growing!" She raised her carefully nursed glass to him. "And the vino is exceptional."

I was in trouble.

K: "So.. Don Francino.. We could start talking and be at this well after midnight and get very little done. Or, we can get to the heart of the matter, and I can enjoy a Lady's company this evening.." I gave him a tiny smirk, and the ol' 'shifty eyes' towards Rarity. "..before she's too tired."

Don Francino: "AH!" *Chortle* "Of course! Of course.. of course.." He nodded to me, repeatedly, then raised his forehooves. "The Docks."

K: "We need those slipways finished as soon as possible. Maximum effort. Every little thing we accomplish is another stab at Tirek." I shrugged. "Propaganda aside, you must realize that if we lose, you will end up dead." I nodded. "That said, Princess Celestia has some vague concept that.. arrangements.. exist in the real world. Me? I know they exist." I leaned in a bit. "My upbringing was in the orbit of.. fine businessmen.. like yourself. Humans, of course, a little quicker with the straight razor than yourselves. But.." I gestured all around me. "..I know how all this goes. I know how to be magnanimous, humble, respectful. You didn't get to where you are without earning respect." I nodded firmly.

Don Francino: "Hmmm.. you amaze me, General K. I didn't think Humans had something like us." He shrugged. "I suppose I was wrong. Yes, I see that you know your manners."

K: "Then allow me to cast aside the double entendres and innuendos. Everything has a price, Don Francino. What's the price on getting the labor I need at the Naval Yard, motivated labor, that will get these things done as fast as possible, as safe as possible?" I rest my hands on the table.

Don Francino: "Ah." He nodded, gestured a bit, and rest his hooves on the table as well. "The contract signed with the Government sees to it that the total labor cost - which a construction company that I have an interest in, provides - comes to one hundred thousand bits." He nodded. "The term of the contract sets an expected employment term. Thus, we are guaranteed that amount for working that amount of time." He shrugged. "What's your schedule?"

K: "I want the existing six slipways retrofitted in thirty days. I want an additional six larger slipways constructed in 120 days. I also want an additional three extremely large slipways constructed in 180 days. The labor contract provided 100,000 Bits for labor for a term of 90 days, and you're overdue on the first two slipways." I nodded. "Add in the extra labor, we're talking about something like two and a half times as much slipway square footage. I say that's worth another 300,000. Do well, there's a lot more work where that came from."

This is me making note that I can literally hide his bribe in plain sight, if he plays ball. I gave him the "real cost" (that is, the projected Government contract, plus a bonus) first.. it'll be up to him to decide on the "real PRICE." That is, how much of a bribe - or kickback in this case - he wants.

He looked at me thoughtfully for a moment, and realized I was offering him a sole-source contract to construct the entire Navy Yards. I was opening myself to entertain his price. And I was going to do this by cutting out any and all competition he had. This meant that his actual workers - all clean, just ponies trying to make a living - would have guaranteed employment for about six months.. and a promise of more.

Don Francisco: "Given the war and the.. premium.. put on labor.. I don't think you'll find a company in this town that'll go lower than.. say.. 500,000. For you? I can do 450,000." He nodded. "Perhaps.. a small gratuity being in order, if we get further contracts."

That was offering ME a kickback.

K: "I need no gratuities, Don Francino." My tone was low and humble. "The offer is appreciated." And I acknowledge that he's offering me a piece of the pie. "I only want to see good, hard working ponies get a fair day's wage, and the Shipyards, a fair day's labor." I shrugged a bit. "Four-hundred and fifty.." I nodded, seeming reflectful. "..sounds quite fair." I raised my head, and extended my arm. "We'll have the contracts sent to your company within the week."

And me accepting the first offer, not negotiating, not haggling, could be seen as either me thinking the offer is fair, or me simply caving to pressure. Denying the offered kickback indicated I was aware of what the price meant, and accepted it.

We shook on it as the Tiramisu arrived.

Thirty minutes later, we were out the door.

K: "Cara!" I called to the roof. "Condition Blue! Stand Down!"

I'd deal with Chief O'Bogs.. later.

So, that's how I managed to properly conduct myself before a Mafia Don, negotiate a proper deal over an important military asset, and allow the expansion of Mafia control over Labor and Labor Unions for the sake of the war.

Whether Chemical Lens would allow him to live very long AFTER the war.. was up to her.


Oh, yes, when we got back to the Hotel, Rarity practicaly tackled me into bed. She had just enough of the wine in the last half hour to get herself buzzed.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Roller Coaster Emotions

TIME: 08:01 ERDT
DATE: War Day 679/13 Secundus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Royal Air Force Base Quonset Point, Annaquatucket, Rowed Island, Kingdom of Equestria

I didn't have an escort, this time. Dash was supposed to meet me, but she had a really bad cold and couldn't come. I felt.. oddly vulnerable. And made sure I had two extra Morgan magazines on me.

The state militia commander, Longhut Timbers, was originally an Engineer officer, but their state militia commander, Tile Green, had been elderly in the first place at 72 when the Militia was formed, and was ordered by Golden to step down. Longhut was actually fourth most senior, but was voted to be the next Commander.

Rowed Island was very small, the smallest State in the Kingdom. About 400,000 ponies lived here. Given that Rowed Island also had one of the first smaller Naval Yards outside of Baleston and Fillydelphia, and manufacturies for the A-class Corvette's parts, it was already a center of military industry. The state's Militia was only one Battalion, however. They had nine Infantry companies, two Engineer companies, two Cavalry companies, three Artillery companies (one Anti-Tank, two Field Artillery), and two Ranger Companies. An odd arrangement, but suited to the defense of the state.

Major Timbers: "We're grateful you could come at such short notice, General." He nodded.

K: "I don't get why you need ME, specifically, but I'm here to help however I can." I said, as we exited the carriage at the site of the future Air Force base.

Then, I saw it. The one thing any Military officer hates more than enemy soldiers.

HIPPIES!

They had signs of all kinds. "Give Peace A Chance" "No More War" "Ban The Bomb" "Free Love, Hate Costs" "No More Bases" and the like.

They were also very vocal.

K: "Awwwwwwwwwwwwww...!! Shit!" I spat into the dirt. "THIS?! Really!? For FUCK SAKES!" Good thing I was out of earshot of them.

Major Timbers: "Ahh.. problems, General?" He tilted his head at me. The chestnut stallion with chromes had a buzz cut mane, and a short tail. He was a Square. Totally. "You sound like.. almost like you've seen-"

K: "I have!" I shoved my hands into my trench coat pockets, and snorted violently. "Hippies. Fucking HIPPIES!" I growled.

Major Timbers: "Do.. ah.. you have an idea of what to do about them?" He nodded back at the protestors.

K: "I'd love to line them up and shoot them as traitors, but that is not our way, Major." I delivered that line with a chill harsher than the winter breeze - I'm sure Sombra got goosebumps, even at this distance. "No.. you.. we had things like this in my world. Granted, the war THEY were protesting was far less black-and-white, and had a LOT of morally questionable acts to outright war crimes going on, perpetuated by MY country, and the whole thing was a giant mismanaged mess from start to finish. Thing is, that war ended, and they didn't - some went on to conduct domestic terrorism, bombing defense facilities, attacking military personnel or recruitment offices, governmental buildings, and even assassinating low level government officials." I shrugged.

Major Timbers: "All.. all they've done s'far is sit there. Sit there, chant, light a fire every night, sing songs, and.. I think they might be consuming.. unusual plants." He shrugged.

K: "Major, does this world have Marijuana?" I was right to the point. "Or any other recreational narcotics?"

Major Timbers: "I.." He blinked rapidly. "..I've heard of Native Ponies and Buffalo in the south-west consuming Peyote.. never heard of Marijuana.. and.. I mean, I.." He frowned. "I had a cousin that once became addicted to sleeping pills. But, she was the only Pony that I ever knew, that got messed up on any kind of pharmaecuticals."

K: "I expected that. Drug abuse stems from a lot of sources - almost all of them require conditions that simply don't exist here in any quantity." I shrugged. "I mean, I'm very sorry about your cousin, but take heart in that she's a distinct outlier worldwide. In my world, drug abuse is absolutely rampant. Humans seeking an escape, any escape, from something. Drugs to hype them up so they can do things, drugs that drag them down so they can sleep, drugs that alter their perception of reality so they can get away from what's real." I shook my head.

Major Timbers: "That.. that sounds horribly depressing." He frowned.

K: "A bit off topic, though. I mean, I never did any of those things. I was prescribed a certain drug at one point to help me, and I realized on my own that I was becoming dependant on it, and made the active choice to simply stop. Not all humans can do that." I shook my head. "The reason I ask, is, you get a Hippie that's fried their brain on drugs, they stop being ABLE to think logically, or long term. They think only based on their feelings, and on short term gratification." I nodded to the protestors. "If they aren't brain fried, I might be able to TALK to them."

Major Timbers: "I see!" He nodded with a grin. "Well.. I am glad to see that even drugs are nothing for our General." He patted me on the shoulder.. it was a warm, friendly encouragement. I rather liked this man.. er.. stallion - always ready to cheer on his comrades. "So.. negotiate, eh?"

K: "I hope so. I'm going to go over there and have a chat with them. See what I can do for the moment. I'll probably need a ride to the Inn, later." I nodded to the Carriage.

Major Timbers: "Of course. If you need anything, I'll be at the construction site headquarters, about a kilometer down that way." He nodded.

K: "Understood." I nodded to him, and walked forwards.

I was immediately approached by a.. light-lime mare with red dreadlocks. A Cutie Mark of a tree trunk with a heart on top of it.

And she whacked me with her sign.

K: "OWIE!" I rubbed my head - that hurt! "Knock it off!" She tried to whack me again, and I just grabbed it from her - Earth Pony grasp fields have nothing on human hands. "Stop!" I stated firmly. "I want to talk." I held on to the sign ("Make Love Not War"), and looked at her. "Since you seem to know who I am, who are you?"

Tree Hugger: "Tree Hugger.. like.. defender of nature 'n stuff." She fixed me with a stoned-but-steely gaze.

K: "Oh.. I see." I nodded. "And these are your friends?" I nodded to the crowd.

Tree Hugger: "Like, duhhh." She spoke slowly, like a stoner might, after one too many bong hits left them permanently stuck at 80% mental speed, even sober.

K: "Come on, come on.. you.. clearly believe in pacifism." I held the sign out to her. "Why don't you try and give me a fair chance, here, hmm? I mean, this is the first time we've ever met, and if you only base your opinion on what other people say, you could miss out on making really good friends."

I was trying ever so hard to be nice.

Tree Hugger: "Uh.. fine. I suppose." She sighed. "Can I, like, have my sign back?"

K: "Are you going to hit me with it, again?" I stated, flatly.

Tree Hugger: "....okay, then, like.. keep it." She blinked slowly.

K: "Here. You want things, I want things, we can make a deal. We can talk." I gestured to the Carriage. "Let's go to the Inn and get some hot cocoa.. it's cold out here."

Tree Hugger: "Okay.." She blinked again, and I followed behind her as she.. walked past the carriage and headed for the Inn (about two kilometers away).

K: "Let me guess - Carriages are class slavery?" I asked, off hand.

Tree Hugger: "Duhhh." She drawled out.. then blinked when she realized that I called that out. "Like, where'd you hear that?"

K: "Basic tenets of Karl Mareks." They had a copy of the Herdiet Manifesto in the Canterlot Library - I'd thumbed through it to confirm it was basically exactly the same as my world, with a few word replacements.

Tree Hugger: "Far out..! Like.. did you read it?" She meant The Manifesto.

K: "Cover to cover." I nodded - and it was true. You must know your enemy, to know how to defeat them. "I've also read Rules for Radicals, and the collective works of Moo Sea Tung." Same reason.

Tree Hugger: "Wait.. like.." She stopped. "..you actually know this stuff?"

K: "I do." I nodded to her. "Now do you understand that I want to talk?"

Tree Hugger: "Like.. okay!" She started prancing towards the Inn, now, clearly delighted that I understood where she was coming from in some regard.

Truth? I knew these things so I could beat people like this at their own game.

We got to the Inn, and I just took her to the room I'd booked, and put some hot cocoa on. Off came the trench coat, and underneath, I was only in a black collared uniform shirt, cargo pants, and boots. No necktie today.

I then pulled out my cell phone - which had power - and thumbed through my music list.. aha!

She was floored. FLOORED. She was absolutely entranced the entire time the song played. More so that I'd broken out two spoons, tapped along with the tambourine, and sang the male part of the lyrics.. she produced her own tambourine partway through the song, and mimic'd it.

Once the song was over, she pulled out a loose leaf notepad and copied the lyrics, changing "California" to "Coltifornia," but leaving the rest absolutely the same.

She looked up to me, with wonderment in her eyes, and couldn't speak for a few moments.

Tree Hugger: "Duuuuude..." She started.. and just put her things down completely, and paced over to me. "You.. you GET it." She smiled, elated, and pressed the soft part of her hoof to my cheek, blushing.

I gently took her foreleg in my hand, and looked her right in the eyes.

K: "Just because I'm in the position I am, doesn't mean I'm a bad person." I smiled to her. "You get that?"

Tree Hugger: "TOTALLY!" She was excited, her hooves were tapping.

I leaned back a bit, in my chair, and nodded to her, with a smile.

I'd broken through the lines of communication with her. With MUSIC. Something ELSE important in this world.

Tree Hugger: "Okay, like, then.. if you GET that.." She got the hot cocoa off the fire and poured it. "..then you, like.. you get me." She nodded. "You get all of me."

K: "I'd like to think I do." I nodded to her.

Next thing I knew, she was all over me.. her tongue dove into my mouth (tastes like Jasmine tea - that earthy grassy taste), and she was straddling my hips.

Applejack was going to BUTCHER this chick!

She pulled back with a line of sticky saliva between us.

Tree Hugger: "And, like, you also get the concept of 'Free Love,' then, right?" She was panting.

I was in so much trouble.

..ehh fuck it. I want to say 'I've never banged a Hippie before' but I've been with Toola Roola three times as it is. She was.. sort of.. a Hippie. Closer to a Beatnik Artist, really.

My cock was not letting my thoughts go any further.. and I was getting my shirt off already.

K: "Totally." Was all I said.

My pants were down, I was unzipping my boots, and we were on the bed before I could really process what was going on. She stripped me. Naked.

Tree Hugger: "I wanna see.. what you really look like." She said as she did it.

Her mouth went down over my growing erection almost immediately. It was a VERY experienced mouth. Like, my God, she instantly knew to tongue-flick my urethral slit, slather it all the way down to my balls, and truly DEEP throat my monkey prick.

I just moaned. Like.. fuck everything, this was amazing. She was clearly THE most experienced lover I'd ever had.

She MADE me bust a nut into her throat, and swallowed with my dick deep inside it.. that alone was incredible. She was still.. VERY horny.. and she just slithered up to my hips, and mounted me. Better than Toola, her marehole was pillowy soft and experienced, but not too loose. And she could GRIP.

She.. then proceeded to make the same mistake every other Mare had to date. She rode me. It kept me hard, but it WOULD NOT get me off.

It got HER off though. Often. Hard. The last three were screamers.

I then reached up and told her the same thing I'd told all my past lovers.

K: "Tree.. I do better on top."

TIME: 18:23 ERDT

Yes, a near ten-hour fuckfest with the undisputed Queen of Free Love.

My balls ached.

She was unconscious.

I was ordering dinner.

I guessed her to be an absolute Vegan, so I ordered her a large garden salad with a Hay side, cucumbers, and carrots. Only raw food, no meat, no lacto-ovo. Natural Sparkling Water, and Green Tea.

Me? I ordered a ham steak and potatoes, coffee, and a chocolate pie for dessert.

They were delivered, and I woke her up.

Tree Hugger: "Like.. even a righteous dinner!" She hugged me. "Duude.. you're the best." She eyed my ham steak though.

K: "My physical dietary requirements are different. I literally need meat to live." I nodded. "And I love chocolate."

Tree Hugger: "...EH! Okay, dude, ya got me." She nodded, and dug in.

We didn't talk at all while we ate, either.

Once we were done, and enjoying the after dinner drinks, though..

K: "So.. ah.. we were supposed to talk business." I shrugged.

Tree Hugger: "I want nature protected, dude." She nodded.

K: "Tirek doesn't care. I do. Talk to me." I nodded back.

Tree Hugger: "I like.. want a guarantee that you'll-" She stopped and looked at me. "-really?"

K: "Tirek, if he had his way, would probably roast you alive. Your friends, too. He literally hates ponies, and he has and will kill ponies for his beliefs. I respect yours. I want you to be free enough to hold these kinds of protests, and make sure Nature is as respected as we can be. If Tirek wins, you get nothing. Understand that I select and lay out things like military bases and factories as best I can, respecting both that we need them and that Nature needs to be taken into account. I try VERY hard to leave this place as unspoiled as I can, but the War means I need to compromise. Either that, or Ponies die. Needlessly. I've been there when they have, and I can recall EACH face.. each one that died." I slid over to her and embraced her. "I don't want you to ever be one of them.. too many have died already."

She started crying as she held me.

Tree Hugger: "Like.. I can FEEL that!" She clung to me desperately. "I can.. like.. I can feel those bad vibes, that dark stuff.. it.. it's hurting you so bad!" She leaned up and kissed me again. "I.. I can't.." She cried more.

For me.

And them.

K: "You see now that I'm not a bloodthirsty warmonger? I need that base. I need to be able to intercept Tirek's ships and large flying Raptorians so they can't attack Rowed Island or Cobnecticut, or Maresechusetts. This base is the best possible spot. And there's so.. so much more." I nuzzled her.

She gripped me tighter.

We were silent for a bit.

Tree Hugger: *Sniffle* "Okay." She leaned up and looked at me. "But, like.. I'm.. I've got to help you some how. You're in so much pain."

K: "This helps." I meant the hugging.

Oh, I'm still naked, you know!

We cuddled most of the night, though we did fuck again. It was a slow, almost romantic, trance-like fuck. Close to Tantric Sex, really, but I was getting her off to much for it to fit that label.

She accepted me and what I was doing. I literally fucked the sense into her, I suppose? And the very next day, she went back to her friends, and talked to them. They all had to hug me, to feel that pain, and try and sap some of the hurt off of me. Share the load.

I got them to agree to join the State Militia, specifically so they could be assigned to guard this base. Now that they understood how important it was. I also gave them leave to plant trees and plants that would help the environment that we were displacing.

In the end, I made a friend.. several friends.

And as we all know..? Friendship is Magic.
