Part 1: Strategic Discourse

TIME: 13:00 ERST
DATE: War Day 450/29 Sextus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Royal Palace, Canterlot

I was in conference with Celestia, my senior department officers (Commandant Forest Spirit, Vice Admiral Saletine, Air Chief Marshal Aero Dart, Lieutenant General Silver Spark, Commander of the Guard Ironhide, and Commissioner Jack Galloway of the Gendarmes), the girls, and a few others.

I was laying out my plans to find Coltonville.

K: "And as I discussed earlier, if we let Tirek get there first, he may find things we don't want him to. I'm not sure what, but I'd rather not just hand it all over to him." I shrugged.

Celestia: "And I'm sure your Department Chiefs can handle the war in your absence." She nodded, sagely.

K: "Not that there's much war to be had, at the moment. Neighpon is our active battle front, and that's degenerated into a non-linear, asymmetric warfare scenario." I looked at Saletine.

VADM Saletine: "AYE! Aye... until we get them true steel hull ships in th' waters, we be facin' an enemy who's got tougher ships'n we, Yer Royal Highness." He bowed his head a bit. "Which won't be fer anodder few months, I be afraid. 'Till then, I sez, our best bet's ta keep the Neighponese captured ships bristlin' Tirek's defenses."

LGEN Silver Spark: "We don't have the ground troops in place to invade much more than we already have." He shrugged. "The Marines that were sent were most all wounded in the attack on Neigha. Which, while a success, left us depleted of ground forces. Even the Neighponese suffered serious losses of pony, equipment, and materiel." He looked over at me. "Been a long time since Chowsin Ridge. Kinda.. kinda wish I was back there some times.. heh."

K: "Being the Big Boss is hard, Spark." I shrugged.

After Chowsin Ridge, Spark's injuries kept him off the field for a few months. In that time, he read and studied the manuals that Colonel Williams had given me.. he educated HIMSELF to be a leader. This included course books on leadership from West Point.

Forest Spirit: "The reformed 1st Marine Division will be ready to depart for Neighponese waters around the same time as the Steel Hull Warships are ready to set sail." He nodded. "Training has been expanded to six weeks, as per General K's recommendations, and Colonel Williams' field manuals. We've finished adapting the course work for Ponies." He looked over at me, and shrugged. "Which K and I did together."

ACML Aero Dart: "Training our Air Forces hasn't been easy.. but, the Crystal Kingdom's assistance has been immeasurable. They found a fourth Excursion Yacht in a repair shop in the Capital and have put it into service. They're also looking for the lost Dreadnaught and any other technology they can find. In the meantime, they've.." He looked at the door. "..where IS she?"

Air Commodore Iris Emerald came charging in right about then. As she was now a flag officer, her former white linen pants were replaced with blue pants with a red stripe. The red sash around her waist, stayed. Still overly formal, but whatever.

Iris: "Sorry I'm late!" She made it to the table, and sprawled out papers. "I had a heck of a time attempting to get these transcribed in copies, properly." She shook her head. "Everything was such a rush, General.." She looked up at me for a flicker, down, then back to the papers.

Aero Dart: "One of the few aeronautical designers left in the city was thinking of this at the time things happened. An Aero Fighter. As we saw, the Herdiets already have something like that." He looked at me.

K: "Single fan design - the lifting fan gets ducted to the rear for forward propulsion. They're fairly slow because of that." I nodded, recalling the Herdiet air craft.

Iris: "THIS Aero Fighter incorporates a double-ducted lifting fan, near-neutral bouyancy, a flying wing shape, and a single small fan at the rear for propulsion." She held up one of the master copies. "It can be armed with two machine guns and 1200 rounds each. It could also have one or both guns removed, and up to two hundred pounds of bombs in its place." She shrugged. "Or a Comet Arrownal - what General K calls Rockets."

K: "And the hangup is...?" I looked at her.

Iris: "We don't have an engine light enough, powerful enough, or small enough to fit into it. For the best balance of everything, smallest size, and least compromises.." She shrugged. "..we can't make something THAT much smaller than the XY's. I mean, we could make a slimmed down XY, but.. it's still more a small airship or airlaunch than a fighter or bomber like what K was thinking of." She shook her head. "We lost so much..." And trailed off.

Celestia: "I think K's adventure to Coltonville might pay dividends in that regard." She raised her head, sagely. "If his tales of what Coltonville's technology was like are correct, then there's a strong possibility we can take and adapt some of it. Between the NEIGHTO alliance, we have scientific experts that Tirek can only dream of." She grinned proudly.

K: "Problem is, Tirek always seems to be a step ahead." I looked over at her. "He fielded tanks before we did, ironclad ships, stole an atomic device and knew how to use it.." I shook my head. "..we may have more geniuses than he does, but he has a FAR more well organized Research and Development program than we do." I shrugged and shook my head. "I'm only one man. Spike transcribed everything on my cell phone. Whatever I had to offer, besides ideas, is in the hands of you ponies, now."

Forest Spirit: "You still seem to have better ideas about war than we do, K." He leaned in to the table a bit.

K: "Yeah, well.. you all are learning. Quickly." I nodded. "But, Celestia is right - I can best serve the cause by leading another Expedition while we wait for the rest of the war to catch up with us. Grogar's death has probably put a MASSIVE crimp in Tirek's plans - that was his third in command, no doubt, under Scorpan. He hasn't many chief minions left, that I can name. Rep, Somnambula, Trixie.. Scorpan himself." I gestured. "Gorosbif, maybe, if he's still alive." I looked at them, though. "There were other ancient enemies that haven't been seen, yet. Lavan, the Lava Emperor was especially heinous. He was crystallized and destroyed."

I didn't know it, but that's what should have happened to Sombra. Who was now my friend. Talk about changed fates... debate, if you will, if Sombra in this reality was less evil, or if his history had been significantly altered and his motivation changed.

K: "Queen Bumble, the queen of the bees.. large, sentient honeybees that lived in Dream Valley until they were chased out by the Flutter Ponies. She held a grudge against them. She sought an artifact called the Sun Stone, to warm up the land she was exiled to, but she failed, and was defeated. Hydia was involved in that, too." I looked around the room. "The bees would be formidable adversaries for Pegasi.. we'd need Fighter Pegasi to counter them." I shrugged with both hands open. "If Tirek didn't give them firearms, that is. If he did, it'll be a very costly fight for air dominance."

Celestia: "And there are still others?" She tilted her head.

K: "A couple of note. Erebus the Shadow Monster is probably the next most worrisome after Lavan. He literally eats shadows, but he doesn't digest them - he just deprives a person of their shadow. This takes away a piece of their soul. Those so robbed lose their warmth, kindness, generosity, and sense of friendship. It probably drains their magic, and certainly physically atrophies them. If it killed anyone because of that, it wasn't shown." I gestured to Celestia. "Lavan's only more worrisome becaue, I'm sure, if he re-formed somehow, he could have power on the same level or greater than yours - and dominion over lava itself. I'd not like to think about Canterlot being turned into a giant volcano."

Forest Spirit: "How were they defeated?" Right to the point.

K: "This is what makes Erebus a notch lower than Lavan. He was eradicated by Flutter Ponies using a mass magic wave called Utter Flutter - but, if I'm right, the Elemental Jewels and the Sword of Rainbow's Light would be more than enough to blast him to pieces. You can.. dismiss or desummon him by blasting away his ability to hold shadows within himself. Destabilize his control, the shadows leave and find their former owners. He loses power. And possibly dies. If Tirek revived him, or he resurrected himself, he can simply be banished again. And we can find a more permanent solution this time around." I looked at all of them.

Aero Dart: "Seems plausible enough." He nodded.

Silver Spark: "I think you're on the right track, K." He gently tapped a hoof on the table. "That's why warfare here is so different - we have both the magical and the scientific to consider." And a head-shake. "Which makes the Elements so priceless."

Twilight: "Meaning we have to be available if ANY of these monsters show up." She looked at the other girls.

K: "Mhm. And Lavan, on the other hand?" I shook my head slowly. "He was defeated using the Princess Wands. Which, Celestia assures me, were long lost."

Celestia: "I'm actually fairly certain that's what Luna used to make the Elemental Jewels." She nodded. "Buutt.." She looked at me.

K: "If that's the case, the only way to defeat him is to crystalize him. Overload him with magic and he pops like a balloon - PINKIE DON'T YOU DARE!" I pointed at her.

She held up a balloon filled with whipped cream, then lowered it slowly as everyone gazed at her.

K: "Which can be.. either a good or bad thing. If I'm right, he'd be easier to beat than Erebus. If I'm wrong, he'll be harder. If I'm right, Crystal Pony Unicorns alone can defeat him - some do have access to spells that can crystalize things. Meaning, actually, his natural counter is Sunshine Smiles and Cadence. They might be able to take him all by themselves." I shrugged. "But if I'm wrong, and he's somehow adapted to that weakness, science may be the only solution. We deal with him like we dealt with the acid blob. Liquid Nitrogen while he's in his lavatic form. Freeze him solid, then shatter him. Or, freeze him and imprison him forever." I waved towards the palace walls. "Not that anything lasts forever, around here. It might be a few thousand years, though. Certainly well enough for our children's grandchildren to be safe from him."

Twilight: "I really wish we knew more. Which ones were up and working. Which ones were alive." She shook her head.

COMR Jack Galloway: "We'll start an investigation immediately." He nodded. "If my ponies can find any trace of any of them, we'll let you know."

For a pony, he looked as much like James Gordon as you can get. Horn-rimmed glasses, moustache, button-down pale tan shirt, dark pants, suspenders. Acted like him, too. Just, he didn't have a BatPony to call on when things got tough - more or less, that's what we were for.

K: "We will find out. And we will ram Equestria's might up their bumholes until they die, beg for mercy, or are otherwise vanquished." I nodded, firmly. "I don't care who Tirek sends, we're going to win."

Rarity: "Ah! That's the spirit, darling!" She beamed.

Applejack: "Uh-huh. 'N after we git through wit' them, we get Tirek." She nodded.

Celestia: "Mm.. peace, though, will still take a while, I'm afraid." She shrugged a bit. "Anyway, K, I'm sure we can hold things together while you're gone. Go ahead. Pick whomever you need."

K: "The girls, my boys. Plus Havoc, Bella Donna, Webley Weaver, Tankette Blinda, Lyra, Bon-Bon, Ambrosia, Gilda, Gorcat, Jade and Katrina if she's up to it." I nodded. "I want friends I can trust. If anything goes horribly wrong, like the emotion stuff in the Crystal Kingdom, I want to know I have a counter to it."

Toola: "Well.. have fu-"

K: "You count as one of the girls, Toola." I looked over at her, then a brief glance to Pinkie, who was making a cupcake float. As in, float in the air.

Toola: "REALLY!?" She beamed. "You're not just saying that?!"

Twilight: "I think you've more than proven yourself." She nodded, and put a hoof around her.

Dash: "No kidding. Besides, we share hair stuff." She flicked her rainbow mane.

K: "Nineteen of us. Let's take two more. Suggestions?" I looked at the girls.

Twilight: "Chemical Splash." She nodded. "She's an expert chemist as well as a criminologist. We might need that."

Rarity: "Spike."

Everyone looked at her.

Celestia: "Don't you think he's a bit young..?"

Rarity: "He's 13, now, yes?" She tilted her head.

Celestia: "Yes, but.."

Rarity: "He's been wanting to prove himself since the war began. He can handle weapons, and, he's our only option for very long range emergency communication." She nodded sagely. "Plus, I've made this fantastic, cute little uniform for him.." She rolled her eyes cockily, with a grin.

K: "She has a point." Everyone expected me to say about the communications. "You can't let that uniform go to waste." I looked at her.

Rarity: "K! I think you're FINALLY getting it!" She giggled.

K: "We're closest to the serch area from Ponyville. We'll just have to march." I shrugged. "I mean, we could take the XY's, but I'd rather have them on standby with the Aero Marines if things get hairy." I looked at Iris. "I want you in command of the airship squadron. All four XY's, armed and ready."

Iris: "When, then, do we leave?"

K: "Month and a half - we have a wedding to plan and execute, and my dear future wife needs time to gestate our foal, then make Celestia a surrogate mother." I nodded. "It'll give you time to completely overhaul them and prepare them for flight."

A bit of a long conference, but now, everyone knew where we stood. More importantly, we now had much better cooperation with the Crystal Kingdom and their 'lost' technology of combat airships.

And.. I had a wedding to look forwards to.

Part 2: Wedding Plans

TIME: 08:45 ERST
DATE: War Day 451/30 Sextus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Ponyville, Kingdom of Equestria

I was seated at the twice-rebuilt Rose Cafe, talking with Rose herself, who'd be hosting the double-wedding..

..what, not everything that happened to me was about bloodshed, suffering, and trauma of mind and body! I can have a section all about me talking with a couple friends about my wedding plans.

K: "So, Applejack, of course, wants a very apple-themed wedding." I shrugged big, hands all the way up. "And Forest Spirit and I don't really care, as long as our ladies are happy."

And, of course, Nurse Redheart wanted hearts all over the place. Just because.. you know, it's her thing.

Roseluck: "Do YOU want anything in the wedding, K?" She tilted her head, making notes.

K: "I.. know it sounds.. strange.. but.." I shook my head. "My Faith has certain traditions.. that I've largely broken by sleeping with anything that has a pulse..." I looked down a bit. "Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue." I looked back up at her. "For luck." I nodded a bit.

Roseluck: "Really, now? Huh." She scribbled. "Sounds pretty close to us, actually.." She shook her head. "Pinkie's doing the cake herself."

K: "I figured." A small gesture, as I sipped my tea.

Roseluck: "I guess Rarity's doing the dresses and your suit?" She tilted her head. "Or, what DO humans wear at weddings?"

K: *Boisterous laugh* "For MY human wedding, we were naked!" I could see the look on her face. "NO! Really! In my wife's faith, all religious ceremonies are conducted nude!"

Roseluck: "REALLY!?" She giggled. "I.." She stopped. "I was going to say, 'I can't imagine you naked' but.." A long giggle. "..a lot of mares have." She lolled her eyes a bit. "Sorry, K."

K: "No, no, it's alright!" I waved my hands. "I've.. well, noticed that most ponies go around naked if they can, and probably two thirds of the town generally does, and then outside of town, maybe a sixth? Depends on the area and the season. Humans? Never. Being naked is considered rude or a sign of insanity." I shrugged.

Roseluck: "Really, now!? You know, I don't think we've ever talked about this. More pizza?" She slid over the serving tray with the pepperoni pizza on it.

K: "Yes, please. You do a good job of this, Rose." I nodded. "And to answer your question more directly, humans wear something called a tuxedo. I've seen similar fashions around here, but always in dark colors. For weddings, tuxedo suits are generally a bit more... obtuse. Silly, even. Frilly shirts, pastel colors, bell bottoms - which are considered long out of fashion, and strips of elegant ribbon along the limbs, sometimes. Generally, humans go to a wedding planner or a dress store, then a suit store." I made a gesture as I took another slice.

Because of her hooves, she couldn't do hand tossed, so she did a thinner crust plied out flat on a board. Round, of course.

Roseluck: "So weird." She shook her head. "Why?"

K: "Human weddings, if done formally, are a celebration and a chance to get far more fancy than one's station - tuxedos are generally rented, for example. So, everything is kinda a bit outlandish, just to.. go nuts and be silly and formal at the same time. That make sense?" I tilted my head as I chowed down.

Roseluck: "It does! It so does!" She giggled a little.

Webley: "Pizza is a vegetable!" She stole a slice. "Mmmmm... fresh vegetable.."

K: "She's having an episode." I looked at her. "Nix versus Heddon, eighteen ninety-three."

Webley: *TWITCH!* "While the United States Supreme Court acknowledged that a tomato is, in fact, a fruit by botanical definition, it should be treated as a vegetable for matters of trade. In 2011, the United States Congress blocked changes to the Food and Drug Administration's attempts to increase the amounts of certain ingredients in school lunches - specifically that pizza should contain a half cup of tomato paste per serving to be classified as a vegetable.." She shook her head. "OH DARNIT!"

K: "I can get her to do that all day." I shrugged. "When she has reception."

Webley: *Whine* "Please don't!" She sat obediently, and ate her stolen slice.

K: "Gotta pay the toll." I cocked a brow at her. "And if we don't get no tolls.."

Webley: "WE DUN' GIT NO ROLLS!" She cheered out, then covered her mouth. "Darnit!"

K: "It's okay. I wanted you to join in, that time." I put an arm over her.

Webley: "Thanks." She shook her head. "I never did apologise-"

K: "You have nothing to apologise for. Fluttershy admitted she tricked you." I looked over at her.

Roseluck: "What's the Food and Drug Administration?" She looked at me.

K: "An example of governmental overreach that started out as watchdogs for food quality. There WAS a time when processed food had little effective quality control, and things like rats and animal feces were getting in to the food and making people sick. The FDA was started as inspectors for food safety." I shrugged. "Now, they tell you what you can and can't eat to supposedly be healthy - but their recommendations were based on flawed and likely intentionally falsified information to the benefit of certain industries." I wouldn't go further, lest I trigger Webley.

Roseluck: "Hmpf. I don't need something like that - I only serve the finest, best foods I can find. And if I can't get them, I don't serve something that's soiled or spoilt to make up for it." She crossed her forelegs.

K: "Yeah, well.." I raised the rest of my slice. "..that's why I kinda like it here." I munched. "You have morals. Too many humans lack them."

Webley: "So, wedding plans?" She looked at me.

K: "Yeah. The boys are going to be my groomsmen.. I still have to pick a Best Man. I think I know who, though." I shrugged.

Roseluck: "Who!?" She was excited about this.

K: "Sunshine Smiles, if he can make it." I looked at them.

Webley: "I thought you'd pick one of the Majors." She tilted her head.

K: "I would, but, I see all three of them equally. I can't have three best men, so.." I trailed off. "Naturally, I pick someone else I'm close to. It was down to Mac or Sunshine. It would be a bit of a social faux pas in my world to pick my future brother-in-law, so, I picked Sunshine. If he can't make it, Havoc is next on the list." I nodded to both of them. "For a human wedding, a man's best friends and possibly his male siblings are his Groomsmen. His number one closest male friend, or the one of the group that commands the most mutual respect, is the Best Man."

Roseluck: "Pretty much how we do it, here." She shrugged, and went back to taking notes.

Webley: "Soooo.. how well guarded is it going to be?" She looked at me.

K: *Sigh* "I'm not stupid, Webley. I expect the guests to have sidearms tucked away, and rifle racks for those not functioning as Honor Guards. Marine Honor Guards will have Parade Shermans, but I expect them to be loaded. If I was my own enemy, I'd attack the wedding in force, poison the food by covertly replacing the catering staff, and have a very large bomb hidden in the wedding ca-" I looked over, Pinkie was there, grinning like a loon. "No."

Pinkie: "Aww, come on!" She pouted.

K: "This is the one day, Pinkie, where I want the zany contained. This is Applejack's special day. Besides, she wants you to give the second toast speech." I smirked. "Go nuts - she's expecting some kind of stand-up routine."

Pinkie: "I'll TAKE it!" And off she zoomed to prepare her material.

Webley: "She really was, wasn't she?" She looked at me.

K: "Indeed." I nodded. "Only because I mentioned it." I shrugged. "She's just a bit chaotic.." I looked at them. "..never mind."

With wedding plans in the offing, I was looking forward to having some time to relax. Yes, there was a war on. But, I couldn't allow that to make people feel depressed or sad. War Fatigue was a thing, and these ponies, I felt, would be more susceptible to it than humans.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Approaching the Big Day

TIME: 13:46 ERST
DATE: War Day 455/4 Septimus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Rarity's Botique, Ponyville

She wiped her mouth as she zipped me up.

Rarity: "My best work, yet!" She proudly proclaimed as she took another sip of lemonade.

Wait, what were you sickos thinking?! DAMN! Get a life.

K: "Yeah, and they fit perfectly. Just a tad bit of ease to them." I swished my hips a bit.

Rarity was putting the finishing touches on my wedding tux. We went with "traditional" Wedding Blue, which is this strange pastel blue shade that.. Rarity actually had to custom dye, since she didn't HAVE it, and was shocked humans made use of such a shade.

Norfy: "I think they're a bit over the top.." He was adjusting his bow tie.

Gaze: "Awh, c'mon, Norf, issa wedding!" He beamed as he fixed his hoofcaps.

Cosmic: "Yeah, really.. I've never dressed this fancy, before!" He was actually excited.

Mac: "Mm.. too tight." He shook his head.

Rarity: "Give me a moment, Mac." She toddled over.

Havoc: "So, what'd Sunshine say?" He was fitting his tux coat.

K: "Weeellll.. he's coming.."

Havoc: "Aw, I getcha."

K: "But only because he asked if it can be a triple wedding." I looked at the guys.

Norfy: "OH!" He got excited, now. "He's really going to do it?!"

Gaze: "Ah, 'tis a blessin'!" He squee'd.

Cosmic: "A real rags-to-riches story.." He shook his head. "Now us guys have something to think about!"

Mac: "Yeah. Most all th' tales of a pony marryin' above their class's always a poor mare an' a rich stallion.." He shook his head. "..now us colts gotta story of our own."

Havoc: "Yeah! I guess we do!" He yipped.

Dr. Allcome: "I'm pleased to hear this.. are these tails to be this long?" He swished his hips.

Rarity: "Yeth they are!" She had pins in her mouth.

K: "Havoc, that means I want you as my Best Man." I put a hand on his shoulder.

Norfy: "By tradition, that means you should be prepared to take a bullet for him." Norfy nodded to Havoc.

Havoc: "He knows I would." He looked up at me, and I realized that he really was that much bigger than a pony - roughly 7/8ths Human Scale versus the ponies at 3/4ths (or, 6/8ths).

K: "I expect you all to be prepared to defend the wedding." I gave them a mischevious grin. "If I were Tirek, I'd attack." I nodded. "It won't be a secret that this will be a ROYAL wedding, now."

Rarity: "Well! If Tirek thinks he can ruin MY tuxedos, he's got another think coming.." She said, smugly.

She haughtily sauntered over to where she had the spare material pieces for the tuxes, and drew out her Bradley bayonet from behind the counter. She proceeded to STAB the material with all her neck strength.. which is a lot, trust me.

No damage.

Rarity: "I have to use special diamond-edged shears to cut this. I thought the same thing you did, K----.." She looked over at me. "..and I won't let my best friend lose her husband to an errant blade." She nodded.

Cosmic looked down at his tux and tugged it a bit with his teeth.

Cosmic: "This really is amazing, Rarity.." He grinned.

Rarity: "Thank you, Coz." She gave him a sweet grin.

Right about then, Sunshine bust into the room, slammed the door behind him, and braced himself against it.

Just as I would have expected, everyone in the room - Rarity included - drew weapons and aimed them at the door, the windows, and got into defensive positions.

K: "Talk to me, Soldier! What've we got? Raptorians? Duregars?!"

Sunshine: "WORSE! FANGIRLS!"

From behind the door, we could hear squealing and vapid yapping, with some of them trying to break the door down. At least one of them was shouting something about how her oral sex skills would be better than Cadence.

We.. uh.. put the guns away, a bit sheepishly.

Dr. Allcome: "Oh, my.. K, you've spoiled me to paranoia!" He said, realizing he'd actually pulled his Custer out.

K: *Chuckle* "Comes with the territory, Doc." I shook my head with a smirk and walked over to Sunshine. "Hey, bud." I put a hand on his shoulder.

Sunshine: "Sir. I-uh.. General." He didn't know how to address me, any more.

K: "Just, K, old friend." I opened my arms. Bro hug. Complete with back slaps.

Rarity got her garden hose out, and affixed it to her faucet. She set the hose nozzle to Pulsator.

Rarity: "Fortunately, I know how to command THIS battle.." She threw open her front door. "BACK OFF, BASIC BITCHES!" And she started spraying, aiming for the hair.. oh, dear god, the screams of ruined fashion agony..

Norfy: "Eeeehh.. sounds like dying Raptorians.."

We all laughed at that.

Rarity came back inside and detached the hose like it was no big thing.

Rarity: "And with that, we are done." She nodded. "You shan't be having any more trouble today, Sunshine." She patted him on the shoulder.

Gaze: "Aye, mate." He patted him, too. "C'mon, ye may be a Prince soon, but'cher still one'a us!"

Cosmic: "Darn straight." He nodded.

Sunshine: "Thanks, you guys!" He nodded, grinning. "I still can't believe this. I mean.. I was just a low born guardspony." He looked at me. "My sister's invited to the wedding.. I mentioned she's an artist in Las Pegasus.. uh.." He looked suddenly ashamed.

K: "Let me guess. Stripper. As in 'performance artist' and 'performance is clothing optional but includes something loosely interpreted as a dance' and 'I have no idea how to explain this' is this where we're going?" I looked right at him.

Sunshine gave me the most uneasy grin.. and nodded.

K: "I get it. Let me guess, you ALSO have either no idea what sort of pony she is, OR, you know exactly what kind of pony she is, and you're afraid she's going to humiliate you?" I tilted my head.

Sunshine: "Ehm.. we... after mom died, we went our seperate ways. Sis and I never really got along.." He trailed off. "Cadence wanted to invite her."

K: "And you love her more than anything else in the world, so you agreed without thinking." I gestured.

Sunshine: "Yeaaah.. more or less.." *Cough*

K: "WHILE you were getting a small taste of what your old General used to pull in on the regular.." I gave him a smirk.

Sunshine: "On the nose. Sir. Uh, K." He chuckled a bit uneasily.

Rarity: "Keep in mind, Sunshine? I taught her those tricks." She shrugged. "At least I think I did. I might've taught Chrysalis by mistake."

Sunshine: *COUGH* "Rarity!!"

K: "Come on, man, she's a comrade in arms." I gestured towards her. "Just because she's-"

Sweetie Belle: "A WHOOOOORE!" She ran through the botique and up the stairs.

A paddle brush levitated after her at a high rate of speed, and-

*THWHACK!*

Sweetie Belle: "OWWW!"

Rarity: "NOT IN FRONT OF GUESTS!" She sternly reminded.

K: "Just because Rarity is in touch with the physical aspects of... friendship... is no reason to be embarrassed about such things with her. I mean, WE talked about what I did the other night, didn't we?" I looked at the guys.

Gaze: "Ye shure did.. I think we all done a bit o' braggin'..." He smirked.

Norfy: "I was a perfect gentleman." He raised his head a bit.

Cosmic: "You're the one that explained what a Radioactive Spray was." He snickered.

Norfy: "You don't even HAVE a girlfriend!" He shot him a playful look.

Cosmic: "Do so!" He stood up a bit taller. "I've been dating Spritz ever since she lost her wings!" He looked around. "Oh, oops. She.. didn't want me telling anyone.. she's.."

K: "Still a bit ashamed of it, I know. But, hey, with you, at least she can fly a *little* bit, right?" I gave him an uplifting, positive look.

Cosmic: "I suppose so! I mean.. I did take her on a float around Baltimare.. and she can still Cloudwalk.. we.. we did take some breaks.." He suddenly got a bit sheepish and chuckled.

Dr. Allcome: "I'm sure, with you, she's flying higher than she ever has, Coz." He gave an affirming nod.

Rarity: "Oh, I totally agree. After what the poor dear went through, someone like you is JUST the kind of stallion she needed!" She came over, and put her right foreleg over his shoulder. "I'm so happy for her. And you, Coz."

Cosmic: "Thanks, everyone." He grinned with flushed cheeks, and scratched the back of his head with his left foreleg.

K: "I know she's aced her requals. What's stopping her from going back to her unit?" I tilted my head.

Cosmic: "She's just unsure of herself, still." He shrugged. "I-I've been working with her-"

K: "I want her on the expedition." I stated. "She needs to get her combat confidence back. That's the perfect time. She can work with her General, her coltfriend, his best friends, and the Elements. I think, in that environment, she'll see she's still got 'it' to be a Marine."

Cosmic: "You mean it?! SURE! She'll be overjoyed!" He tapped his hooves together.

Quite the expedition I was putting together. I'd have to see about Sunshine's sister, though. That was a more immediate concern. The wedding itself was coming along... soon enough, I'd be married to a pony. The one that most closely resembled my lost love.

[End of Part 3]

Part 4: Helping an Old Friend

TIME: 11:50 Equestrian Royal Western Time
DATE: War Day 457/6 Septimus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Las Pegasus, Neighvada, Kingdom of Equestria

I was here to settle something. Sunshine hadn't seen Sunrise Smiles, his own sister, in eight years. He was worried about her, since she wasn't exactly what one would invite to a royal wedding - and this WAS going to be a royal wedding.

I didn't come alone. Rarity and Rainbow Dash were with me, as was Chemical Splash and Forest Spirit. Despite his status as a Department Commander, Forest Spirit insisted on being on the field with me, following my own example.

We ended up finding out that Sunrise had another name, a stage name. That of Sunblitz Shine. This from a roster of registered "performance artists" in Las Pegasus - the city was VERY careful about keeping such records.

We were met at the station by Needle Nose, one of the senior managers in the Las Pegasus Department of Entertainment Licensing.

Needle Nose: "An' anyway, I don't know what you all want with her." He shrugged, straightening his suit coat.

Chemical Splash: "That's a matter of national security." She said, flatly.

Needle Nose: "Alright, alright." He shrugged. "Anyhow, you'll find her at the Spangled Mare. Up on Tropicana Avenue." He nodded towards it. "Go straight about a mile.." He shrugged. "I mean, it ain't even a main strip joint.." He looked at me.

K: "Mhm. Thank you for your help, Mr. Nose." I shrugged.

For a pony named Needle Nose, his cutie mark was coins with a sparkle over them, likely indicating he had a gift for business. Or, in this case, a gift for giving US the business. I didn't care for him, but he struck me as a man of specific views, rather than a malicious actor.. though possibly a criminal, a man on the take, he didn't feel like a pony that'd been corrupted so bad as to be violent.

Needle Nose: "Oh I gotta come with 'ya. Bosses' orders, you see. They're a bit nervous 'bout the government pokin' its nose inta a low-end performer like her." He shrugged, and habitually straightened his suit coat again. "They're afraid we screwed somethin' up, ya know? Wanna make it right."

Forest Spirit: "You can come. But you cannot interfere with our business." He warned.

Needle Nose: "You gots it." He nodded and adjusted his fedora.

I walked ahead of the group, and Chemical Splash came right up next to me.

Chemical Splash: "I don't trust him." She glared back behind herself.

K: "Makes two of us." I was glad I insisted we all have our sidearms on us.

Behind us, Rarity was doing a fine job of distracting him, going on about fashion and performing and whatnot. I could tell this was some level of torture for him, by the way he gave her disinterested 'yeah's and 'uh-huh's.

After about twenty minutes at a brisk pace, we arrived. To say this was a seedy strip joint, wasn't doing it proper justice. This literally looked like the kind of place that has two sets of back rooms - one for private strip shows, one for illegal prostitution.

Of note, that's actually illegal in this city, unless you're a member of one of the registered brothels. Unlike Maresechusetts, where there's no law governing it. This was NOT a registered brothel.

I coughed a moment, to announce our arrival. Rarity looked nonplussed. Dash seemed a bit ashamed. Splash didn't care. Forest Spirit was like me - unsure, but putting on a bold front. I went in first.

It was crowded, seedy, with the lights dimmed everywhere but the stage. Griffons, donkeys, Zebras, and ponies all, were gathered here, hooting and hollering at the mare performing on stage at the moment. There was a haze in the room caused by cigar smoke, and a smell of cheap booze, vomit, and disgust.

Needle Nose moved over to the bar.

Needle Nose: "Hey, Larry, what's happenin'?" He eased up to the bar as though he had lots of practice.

Larry, the Donkey Barkeep: "Not much, Need." He shrugged. "Getcha scotch onna rocks?" He looked back at us. "What's the G doin' here?"

Needle Nose: "Lookin' for Blitz." He nodded.

Larry: "Inna back. She's up next, though." He shrugged.

K: "Thanks." I put ten bits on the bartop, and slid it to Larry as I walked past.

Payment.

This was going to be like Chicago. I remembered well the politics I learned there. That, many times, elected official and "family" asset were one in the same. The Made Men were managers in city government. This place was no different, save that the crooks were four legged.

The bouncer at the dressing room door? I was much taller than him, and while he was built like Big Mac had spent ten yers lifting, Forest Spirit was also about his size. He glanced at me, glanced at Larry and Needle, then stepped aside. They'd given him the high sign.

Needle followed us in to the dressing area.

Needle Nose: "Cover up, ladies! The G's here!" He announced.

Dash, Rarity, and Splash waited outside the dressing area.

I picked out Sunrise right away. She was the most in-costume, and in fact, almost ready. I walked over to her, and stood behind her, so she could see me in her mirror.

Sunrise: "What'cha want? I go on in five minutes." She shrugged.

K: "Sunrise Smiles? I'm General K of the Equestrian Military." I started. "I wanted to ask you if you accepted the invitation from your brother, for his wedding."

Sunrise: "Eh.." She realized Needle Nose was in the dressing area, looked at him, then uneasily looked back at me. "Yer.. eh.. yer with my date to the weddin' right there." She nodded at him.

Forest Spirit: "Really?" He looked at Needle Nose, who was fixing his tie with a smirk.

Sunrise: "Y-yeah." She got up, and fixed her outfit a bit. "S'cuse me, I gotta go perform." And she moved past us with a quickness. "Y'tell my brother I'll be there."

Things did not add up. Not by a long shot. I ushered Needle Nose and Forest Spirit out of the dressing room, and in to the bar area. Needle immediately went to the bar and got that scotch he was offered, earlier. I noticed he didn't pay.

I leaned in to Chemical Splash.

K: "This place is mobbed up." I started. "I'm going to wager they're going to try and use Sunrise's connection to her brother to try and infiltrate the Crystal Kingdom with the mafia that owns Las Pegasus."

Chemical Splash: "Took you this long to come to that conclusion?" She gave me a very slightly haughty look - I'd cracked her shell!

K: "If this was Chicago, we'd take Needle there out back and break his knees until he talked." I looked at him, and he was watching Sunrise's performance.

Chemical Splash: "What's stopping you?" She tilted her head at me.

K: "Isn't that agaisnt the law?" I asked her.

Chemical Splash: "It is. But..." She looked at the stage. "..that's a future Duchess of the Crystal Kingdom. It might undermine the war effort, if she were compromised." She looked back at me, with a grin.

I looked to Forest Spirit, and gave a side nod to Needle, indicating he was a threat, but not to take action.

So, I went over to the little weasel, and sat next to him.

K: "Now I see why you wanted this assignment. Gotta keep an eye on your Leading Mare, right?" I suddenly acted all broski with him.

Needle: "Ahhh.. now yer gettin' it!" He gave me a nod. "Larry, get th' General a drink, yeah?"

K: "No, thanks. I don't drink." I waved him off. "I wouldn't be a good general if I was drunk half the time, eh?" I ribbed him gently, and felt he had a revolver under his coat.

Needle: "Yeah, I suppose so!" He knocked back his drink all the way, and stared at her like a hungry lion as she danced.

K: "I hate to tear you away, but we could use an escort back to the Train Station, if you don't mind?" I was all friendly, now.

Needle: "Yeah! Sure. Sure." He nodded, and led the way out.

I was glad to be out of there. It stank. In more ways than one.

We walked a bit, before I started in. Forest Spirit was keeping an eye on the environment.

K: "So.. who owns the joint?" I said, casually slipping in my Mob Lingo.

Needle: "This guy named Sal. Good guy. Donkey." He shrugged as he trotted.

K: "Know him well?" I asked, looking at the back of Needle's head.

Needle: "Nah, met him once or twice." He shook his head a bit.

K: "Was that before or after you started getting paid off?" I went for the throat.

Needle: "WHAT!?" He stopped and went to turn aroud-

K: "RARITY!" I ordered.

She was on him like a hawk, and clubbed him over the head with a sock darning ball.. in a sock. Making it a very effective Blackjack.

Forest Spirit: "This building will do." He nodded to the signs. "It's condemned."

K: "Drag him in." I directed, as Dash and I cleared leather and immediately gave cover.

Dash: "Think he's got friends?" She looked up at me.

K: "Guarantee it. I think we were followed all the way from the station. They saw what we just did, I'm sure of it. Fly out of here, top speed, get the Las Pegasus City Militia." I pointed in the opposite direction. "Hook and jive. They might take a shot at you."

Dash: "ON IT!" And with but a moment's preparation, she rocketed into the sky.

I heard a shot, but it didn't hit her. We were surrounded by mobsters, I was certain of it. Probably at least ten of them.

I quick-stepped into the abandoned building, where Spash, Rarity and Spirit already had the weaselly pony tied to a broken chair.

K: "Watch the windows, barricade the room, they're not going to sit on their asses while we have one of their colts." I nodded to them.

Forest Spirit: "You take me to the nicest places." He chuckled as he and Rarity started setting up barricades.

I went over to Needle, and just slapped him across the muzzle to wake him up.

Needle: *N'GAH!* "What the hell do you think you're doing!?" He barked at me.

I grabbed his muzzle hard enough to grind his teeth together.

K: "You're going to confess. To everything." I was cold, again, emotionless.

Needle: "Nothin' doin'! I know my r-AAHAHHAHHHAHAHHA!"

I coldly jammed my bowie knife into his thigh and leaned into it until it found bone. I started digging the tip in, grinding his thigh bone.

K: "Everything, or I amputate. Your buddies are right outside. They won't let us leave, you know it, I know it. They were probably going to bomb the train or something, so this would go away. Problem is, it won't." I looked at him, knife still in his thigh.

Needle: "Y'don't know the half of it!" He hissed out, in pain. "I ain't just workin' for the Mondari's! They takes their orders from.." He looked at the windows. "..ya gotta git me outta here! Ya gotta! Full pro-AAAHAHH!"

I ground deeper.. much more, and I could take the leg by snapping the bone clean.

K: "You get to live and go to prison. That's all. That's IF your information is good. Lie to me, I'll use this to carve you a new asshole." I smacked the blade's grip, sending another shock of pain through him.

Needle: "Okayokaykketektksa.." He drizzled out, his mind going numb. "TIREK! They're takin' orders from TIREK! Through this guy named REP!" He spat out. "When youse was gonna come here, Rep said ta git ridda ya! Said ya must'a figgered out everything!"

K: "He was wrong. I've only figured it out, now." I looked at Splash.

Splash: "This must be where that heist crew came from." She shook her head. "I believe it!"

K: "Makes perfect sense." I looked at Forest Spirit. "SitRep."

Forest Spirit: "Five guys assemblin' out front. Looks like they got Zhukovs and pistols. Make out a couple Custers, couple Morgans. Three Zhukov's, though." He looked back at me.

I stepped back, and opened my trenchcoat, revealing four Bradleys hanging from straps on my shoulders.

K: "Arm up!"

Splash: "I hope I do well.. this is my first time." She grabbed one and checked it.

Forest Spirit: "You'll be fine. The first time's always a bit rough, but you get in to it, you get used to it. Sometimes, you even start to like it." He took his.

Rarity: "You two sound like you're talking about a sex act, not fighting." She grabbed hers, and stuck a scope from her backpack, on it. Instant DMR.

I whipped up the last one, and got it ready.

Forest Spirit: "There's a difference?" He smirked at her.

Rarity: "Oohohh.. Comman-DANT.." She gave him the flirty eyes.

Splash: "Can we FOCUS, people?" She moved to the window. "Orders, General?"

K: "Hm.." I moved up to the window, and looked around a bit. "..can't decide if they're trying to contain us, or what.." I leaned back. "I think they're trying to hold us fixed in place while they wait for something. My guess? Reinforcements."

Forest Spirit: "What do we do?" He looked at them, then the buildings around them. "Think I see a sniper. Building to the immediate left, third floor, fifth window."

Rarity: "Mmm... indeed. He has a Super Sherman." She eye in on him.. paused.. then waved at him. "Target locked, K."

K: "What's his reaction?" I asked, staying out of sight.

Rarity: "Surprised. What do you wish me to do?" She didn't move, other than to talk.

K: "Disable his weapon, but not him." I instructed.

*PAK-SHOOM!*     *CRACK!*

Pony voice, distant: "FUCKING BITCH!"

Rarity: "YOU'RE THE BITCH, FOAL!" She cursed back at him. "Mmm.. this IS just like sex." She giggled.

K: "I've ruined you." I grinned.

Rarity: "Nonsense. If you'd ruined me, we'd be the ones getting married. And I'm afraid that would never work." She flicked a half-glance at Splash. "So, you and Lens?"

Splash: "Buhbhbh-WHA?" She was startled.

Forest Spirit: "Let nothing distract you, Captain." He commented, scanning the rest of the visible area. "No more snipers, K."

Splash: "W-Well, that's not fair! That's private!" She stammered a bit, keeping her aim roughly on the five stallions out front.

Rarity: "Nothing's private in war, Darling." She grinned. "I can take that fat one's hat off." She commented to me.

K: "Do it." I nodded. "I want them threatened, not dead. Not yet."

*PAK-SHOOM!*

Pony voice #2, distant: "MY HAT! YOU FOALISH BITCH!" He wagged a hoof at her.

Rarity: "SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, HOGGISH MARE!" She never moved from her sight.

Not only did she insult his weight, she insulted his gender identity. Did I mention before that Rarity can be a sassy, naughty, bitch?

K: "They're coming. Give them a minute.." I watched one of then snort a line of white powder from his hoof.

Splash: "Mrr.." She shook her head. "...makes no sense.."

K: "As they approach, single shots only." I aimed up.

Fat Pony: "GET 'EM!"

They charged the front, all five of them. One of them, the one that snorted the powder, aimed and fired his Zhukov wildly. Rarity didn't let that stop her, she sniped him first. His head split open, and he went down.

I got the fat one. Three taps to the neck, he grasped it and went down, gurgling.

Forest Spirit got the other subgunner and the one next to him, with four precise tugs of the trigger bar. No big thing - he was a fantastic shot.

Splash whined a bit, but fired on the last one, taking out his knee very precisely, then shooting him in the hip. Disabling but not immediately fatal.

K: "REAR!" I wheeled around, tapped Forest Spirit, and moved to the back area of the floor. While they'd stacked stuff over the back windows and door, it was still a set of entry points. I could see a couple of them moving around back there. I looked at Forest Spirit, and nodded.

Forest Spirit: "Go!" He aimed up.

I pulled the box down from the window, and we both fired five shots, hitting the three ponies down there with a few rounds each. Two were dead, one was severely injured. I moved back to the front.

K: "Status?" I requested.

Rarity: "No movement. I think we got them all, K. Or, the ones we didn't, realized we were no pushovers, and ran for it." She shrugged only minutely.

Suddenly, I could hear shouting. Lots of it. Orders being issued, commands given and acknowledged.

Dash: "COMING IN!" She zoomed through the window. "Ha-HA! Miss me?" She grinned and flipped up her flight goggles.

Forest Spirit: "You missed a good fight." He shrugged.

Dash: "Darn my awesome speed!" She seemed to wring her hooves in front of her.

Rarity: "Really, darling, you saved our hides. HOW many spare mags did you bring, K?" She looked at me.

K: "One per rifle." I shrugged.

The door was breached at that time, by Las Pegasus Gendarmes, not Militia.

LPMG Deputy Sergeant: "CLEAR!" She moved in, and flipped up her own goggles. "Over here, Inspector!" She nodded to me. "General K? Deputy Sergeant Dusty Dunes, Las Pegasus Metropolitan Gendarmes Special Weapons And Tactics."

Her coat was sand-tan, her mane a very sagebrush brown, her eyes were green and sharp - she was muscled, the kind one gets working a ranch or something. I was impressed with her. Las Pegasus SWAT uniforms were a tan take on the standard Equestrian Forest Camo with 5 colors instead of 7, all tan to brown shades. She also wore a shemagh scarf, tactical helmet, and of course, desert goggles.

Behind her, came a pony in a pale tan suit, with greying mane edges. He had a Morgan, but holstered it.

Inspector: "General K? Inspector Broncomil, Las Pegasus MG, Organized Crime." He looked around the room, and settled on Chemcial Splash. "Chem!" He nodded.

Chemical Splash: "Captain Splash, to you, Inspector." She nodded, then looked at me, resuming her 'highly detached' persona. "He may be trusted, General. He's one of the good ones. I've worked a few cases for him, before."

K: "Gotcha." I looked at the prisoner. "He's a military prisoner - and under arrest for attempting to subvert a foreign government, kidnap of a foreign royal official, and high treason against Princess Celestia." I glared at him. "He was stabbed, attempting to resist."

Needle: "NO WAY! THAT PSYCHO HUMAN STABBED ME TO GET ME TO TALK!"

Insp. Broncomil: "I doubt that, Needle Nose." He shook his head. "Everything I've heard about General K says he's a stickler for following Rule of Law. Moreover, Chemical Splash would never associate with him if he broke the rules like that! I should add a charge of defamation of a Royal Official for an accusation like that!" He snorted.

Splash: "He gave us information that merely confirmed my own theories. We have a law and order problem, Inspector. The Mondari Gang have expanded in Las Pegasus, and are openly working with Tirek. They should, from now on, be treated as Enemies of the State, not criminals." She nodded.

Insp. Broncomil: "Indeed." He nodded.

K: "Splash, brief him." I nodded and moved over to Dash. "Not that I'm not grateful, but I thought I asked for Militia?"

Dash: "I saw them finishing up a raid about a mile from here. Looked like a total bust, so, I swooped down and asked 'em if they wanted to help save Equestria's General!" She grinned. "That, and I think they were spoiling for a fight." She shrugged.

K: "They didn't get one, here, either." I shrugged.

Once the Tactical Medic had Needle patched up, I fetched my knife back, and cleaned it off on his suit.

K: "Sergeant, fall in with your team. We have a Royal to extract from a possible hostage situation." I nodded.

D.Sgt Dunes: "You got it, sir!"

She head-motioned and the ponies under her moved up into the courtyard as I followed behind. Inspector Broncomil and a paddy wagon were taking care of Needle Nose and the other two injured suspects.

We marched. The SWAT team did a tactical pepperpot the entire way. I felt.. powerful. Like I was in charge of the greatest fighting force this world had ever seen. That I was followed - both by the living and dead - by badasses.

That I made them this way.

We got to the club, and the SWAT Lead went right up to the bouncer at the front, and cold-cocked him with a sap. He was bound up, and moved aside with a gag in his mouth.

D.Sgt Dunes: "Entry method, General?"

K: *Wry chuckle* "Your team, Sergeant." I nodded, raised my rifle to cover them, and stepped back.

D.Sgt Dunes: "Cactus, Tumble, Sandstorm, Slots, take the rear and hold. Wide Berth, Zachoro, Gelham, on me." She motioned with her right foreleg.

Of note, Gelham is both a Griffon, and the team's medic. And Zachoro is a Zebra.

Everyone nodded and went to their positions. I could see the team's sniper set up across the street with their spotter.

With that, she put a breaching charge on the door and moved to cover. I did the same, with Rarity, Splash, Spirit, and Dash.

D.Sgt Dunes: "Three.. two.. one."

*PAKCHOOWMMM!*

The team swarmed in before the smoke even cleared. We stayed outside to cover them. I could hear Dunes' distinct orders from out here.

D.Sgt Dunes: "GENDARMES! GENDARMES! THIS IS A RAID! EVERYONE ON THE GROUND, HOOVES WHERE I CAN SEE THEM! NOPONY MOVE! DON'T MOVE! SHOW ME YOUR HOOVES! SHOW ME YOUR HOOVES! DROP THE WEAPON! DROP THE WEAPON!"

*PAK-PAK-CHOM!*

D.Sgt Dunes: "SUSPECT DOWN!"

Berth: "FRONT AREA CLEAR!"

Whistle: "SIDE HALL CLEAR!"

D.Sgt Dunes: "MOVE UP!"

K: "COMING IN!" I motioned for Spirit and Dash to follow.

Rarity and Splash took defensive positions at the front entrance.

I went inside, and saw the barkeep, Larry, dead on the floor with two gunshot wounds in his forehead, a Sagebrush shotgun kicked away from him. Dusty must've been sighting him in the whole time. The rest of the patrons were on the ground, on their bellies.

We moved towards the dressing room area. Dusty and Whistle were managing the mares. I looked for Sunrise.

K: "She's not here. They must've brought her out the second we left." I looked at the indoor bouncer, who was on the ground and being secured by Wide Berth. "Bring him here, get these mares out." I made dismissive hand motions.

G.Cpl. Zachoro: "Da suspec', General." He nodded and left us.

I looked at Dusty Dunes.

K: "Choice time. You stay here, you see this, you may never come back from it." I looked at Dash. "You might end up joining us, later.. joining the front line."

D.Sgt. Dunes: "Fine by me, General. Before the war, I did his job - I was a bouncer, kept the dancers safe." She shrugged a tad. "I actually didn't.. have a mark.. until I became a Gendarmes." She looked back at her flank. "It's a rifle, sir. Over a badge."

Dash: "Late bloomer, huh?" She shrugged. "No worries."

D.Sgt Dunes: *Ahem* "I'm 26.." She looked down, then up at me. "What I mean to say, sir, is... without you, I'd've been a Blank Flank all my life, I think." She shrugged. "I certainly didn't have any idea about joining the Las Pegasus Committee of Safety until the war started, and the Gendarmes were formed." She looked at the suspect. "So, really.. I owe you everything."

K: "I have some idea what it means to have that mark. Humans don't get those. We have to develop our skills and find our talents through hard work and practice. But, I get it - you found your way because of the war, and now, you're hoping to pay everyone back, not just the citizens of Las Pegasus." I nodded sagely. "No matter what that means."

D.Sgt. Dunes: "Exactly!" She grinned.

Bouncer: *DRIPPINNG sarcasm* "Aw, how touchin'! Brings a tear t'me eye, an' a pulse t'me black heart!"

I didn't move for a moment, then I turned around and savagely beat his face for about thirty seconds with my gloved hand.

Bouncer: *Wheeze* "YA FUGGIN' APE! I'LL SUE!" He spat blood at my shoe, but missed.

I pulled out my bowie, tested the sharpness a moment, then knelt down in front of him.

K: "Dash, get his pants off." I said, flatly.

Bouncer: "YOU WOULDN'T DARE!" He yelled in my face.

K: "I'm kinda short on time, so, I'm just going to go straight for slowly removing your testicles and rubbing the wounds in the lime salt you guys use for drinks. Then your penis. Then.." I looked at all the spangled costumes. "..I'm going to turn you into a kissy sissy faggot, rape you until I'm fully satisfied, and turn you out on the street corner in Zebra Territory." I said, still looking at the costumes. "Keeping in mind, as a human, I can last several hours in bed. Hours, not minutes." I looked at Dash, and she was over there exaggerating my size a little.

Dash: "I've had him. He's big. He's good. You don't know how lucky of a girl you're about to be!" She grinned evilly.

Bouncer: "U-Uh." He was shaken.

K: *Dripping evil* "How do you think I escaped the Herdiet Union, hm? Asking nicely? I dropped a bomb on them capable of levelling a city. Do you really think I give a shit about your anal integrity?!" I looked right into his eyes, no mercy coming from mine.

Bouncer: "SHE'S AT DON GIONCARLO'S PLACE!" He spat out. "HE'S THE BOSS! RAPE HIM, NOT ME! HE'S CUTER ANWAY!" *SOBBING!*

K: "That's what I like to see." I stood up. "Compliance." I pet his head softly, FAR too softly for an arresting officer, just to remind him. "Charge him with High Treason to Celestia. Life imprisonment. He DID help us." I looked at him, grabbing his mane roughly. "You get to live. In a dungeon cell for the rest of your life. Better watch out, or someone else'll do to you what I just threatened." I slapped him once and walked out.

Did I hate myself for acting this way? No, not really. Sunshine was my friend. A bro. This was his sister. I don't know how she ended up in the clutches of mobsters, her fault or not, but I would not let her be used like this. I would save her.

Besides, my morals left the boat about two years ago.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Criminal Diplomacy

TIME: 13:57 Equestrian Royal Western Time
DATE: War Day 457/6 Septimus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Don Gioncarlo's Mansion, Las Pegasus, Neighvada, Kingdom of Equestria

I decided a sneak attack was out of the question. With the LPMG SWAT unit, the Las Pegasus Militia Rangers, two platoons from the Las Pegasus Militia Infantry, and the Las Pegasus Militia Artillery, we rolled up to the mansion and immediately set up fighting positons.

A full battery of my improved 76x320mm/L38 (not 75) Artillery Guns. Capable of firing anti-tank shells, or high explosive, they had a range of about 10km as artillery pieces, and 3km as anti-tank guns. It was based on the American M5 3-inch gun, but with significant modification to be easier to drag by ponies.

I was about to blow up a house with them.

K: "Battery commander, load one with smoke screen shell. Load the rest with H-E." I instructed. "I'll call the targets in manually, if it comes down to it."

Capt. Balder Dash: "You got it, General!" He pipped his whistle a sec, and went about issuing orders.

K: "Ranger commander!" I addressed the next task.

Lt. Quirt Bolting: "Yes, General?" She came trotting up in a very similar desert uniform as the SWAT team.

K: "Your unit will take the rear. I understand you have urban combat experience?" I nodded.

Lt. Bolting: "Yes, General. My Rangers mopped up a Duregar arms smuggling operation a month ago." She shrugged. "Actually, Inspector Broncomil was the one that requested us - the SWAT Team hadn't been fully formed, yet."

Insp. Broncomil: "This means a lot to me, General. I know it's going outside the rules, a bit, but if we can take down the Mondari gang, we'll go a LONG way towards cleaning up this town." He looked back at the main strip, from the hill we were on. "Our town.."

K: "You're a very dedicated stallion, Inspector." He also reminded me more than a bit of Ronny Cox. "Lieutenant, your Rangers will invade the pool house area, sweep and clear, then take the basement. Hold fast at the entrances to the first floor. SWAT will take the first and second levels. When we call All Clear for the first level, announce yourself and move up with us." I looked at Dusty. "Got that, Sergeant?"

Dusty: "Aye, sir." She nodded.

K: "Both of you make sure you deploy snipers on the outside immediately. If they try to attack or break out, I want them cut down. Go!" I ushured them.

My little team got ready. Rarity had already set herself up on one of the stagecoaches SWAT had converted into transports for their teams. Stacked behind boxes and crates, she had good cover - and a borrowed Hathcock Sniper Rifle.

The rest of us had the Bradleys I'd brought with, though a full load of ammo.

Dash: "What's our plan, K?" She looked ready for a fight.

K: "SWAT and the Rangers have the initiative. We'll follow the lead SWAT element into the mansion. Just be careful - this is a police operation, not a military one, they do things a bit differently." I nodded.

Forest Spirit: "You got it, K." He grinned.

Splash: "I suppose I should go. You want me on the expedition, and this is a fantastic chance to get my feet wet, so to speak." She was semi-detached with that, but also teasing a bit.

Dusty: "We're ready, General." She nodded.

K: "All elements, move into pre-asault position." I instructed. "Be ready for anything."

Once I saw they were in position, I walked to the equipment wagon and grabbed a megaphone. Unpowered, I'd have to shout loudly, but it'd help.

K: "ATTENTION IN THE MANSION! THIS IS GENERAL K OF THE EQUESTRIAN MILITARY! COME OUT WITH YOUR HOOVES AND OTHER APPENDAGES IN THE AIR! SURRENDER, NOW! THE MANSION IS SURROUNDED! YOU HAVE NO HOPE OF ESCAPE! IF YOU SURRENDER, NO HARM WILL COME TO YOU!" I announced, as loud as I could.

Don Gioncarlo: "NOTHIN' DOIN' HUMAN! WE GOTS A HOSTAGE! YOU TRY ANYTHIN', SHE'S DEAD MEAT!" He stood up from his balcony and announced himself.

Hm. An expert negotiator (not). Not that I didn't have a plan for this.

K: "LET'S TALK, GIO!" I called him out by his nickname - which I guessed at. "IT DOESN'T HAVE TO END THIS WAY! WE CAN MAKE A DEAL!" I knew I verbally left myself open, but I did it on purpose.

Don Gioncarlo: "HERE'S THE DEAL! YOU CLEAR OUTTA HERE, PRONTO! OR THE MARE GETS IT!" He shouted angrily.

K: "YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THAT! SHE'S CRYSTAL KINGDOM ROYALTY!" I retorted.

Don Gioncarlo: "SHE'S A HOSTAGE, HUMAN! DON'T MATTER WHAT SHE IS, SHE'S MY GOLDEN TICKET!" He yelled back.

K: "Rarity, get ready. He dies second." I noted that he had a riflepony set up by the planter next to him, likely aimed at me.

Rarity: "Of course, Darling." She dripped with sass.

K: "SHE'S NO GOLDEN TICKET, GIO! SHE'S A MILLSTONE! AS LONG AS YOU GOT HER, YOU AND EVERYONE NEXT TO YOU'S GOT A TARGET ON YOUR BACK! IF IT ISN'T ME TODAY, IT'LL BE LORD SOMBRA TOMORROW! OR CELESTIA HERSELF! OR TIREK! YOU CAN'T HOLD OUT AGAINST EVERYONE! BUT YOU GIVE HER UP, RIGHT NOW, AND WALK OUT OF THERE, YOU DO SO ALIVE! NO TREASON CHARGES! YOU HAVE MY WORD! THAT GOES FOR ALL'A YOUR MOOKS, LIEUTENANTS, AND SOLDIERS, TOO!" Which would immediately sow dissent in the ranks and shake morale.

Don Gioncarlo: "WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I DIDN'T ALREADY MAKE A DEAL WITH TIREK!?" He sneered at me.

K: "Well, that confirms that, I suppose." I shrugged. "YOU'RE A FOOL IF YOU THINK TIREK IS GOING TO LET YOU LIVE, GIO! ONCE YOU'RE NO GOOD TO HIM, HE'LL GET RID OF YOU! AFTER ALL, ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU'D DO?! GET RID OF A THREAT YOU CAN'T TRUST!?" I know 'bad guy' mentality too well, I suppose.

It actually gave him pause!

Don Gioncarlo: "....PARLAY, HUMAN! I WANT PARLAY!"

I motioned for Dusty and the others to stand ready, but take no action.

K: "FRONT COURTYARD, FIVE MINUTES! YOU BRING ONE, I BRING ONE! NO WEAPONS FOR EITHER OF US!" I laid out the terms.

Don Gioncarlo: "DEAL!"

K: "Dash, you're my Second. Rarity, keep his bodyguard in your sights at all times." I instructed.

Dash: "No problem!" She nodded.

Rarity: "Of course, Darling." She grinned a tad.

Five minutes was about the time I needed to unlimber myself of my weapons, and walk over there. Dash kept her Bradley on her. We agreed I'd go for her Morgan if I needed a gun - she had it in the pony equivalent of an ankle holster.

Don Gioncarlo was a very fancy pony in a three piece suit, silk scarf, and matching fedora, all grey, with a boutoniere. His bodyguard was in a black turtleneck and grey suit coat, toting a Zhukov.

K: "Don Gio, I thank you for the audience." I nodded to him a bit deeper than I ordinarily might. Respect. I knew my manners.

Don Gioncarlo: "Human." He nodded to me in return.

K: "K, please. My friends call me K." I looked at him evenly.

Don Gioncarlo: "K, then. I want a deal." He looked around as if he was just now processing how much trouble he was in.

K: "I have the militia here.." I looked at the 76mm guns. "..be a shame if we had to assualt the place. Those guns do a lot of damage." I nodded. "What's your offer?"

Don Gioncarlo: "Take the girl, walk away." He nodded. "You gimme your word on that."

K: *HAH!* "I can't do that, Don Gio. We're acting on behalf of the Crystal Kingdom's military and government. That mare in there is a duchess. You've got a target on your back from them. Lord Sombra may be on our side, now, but he hasn't stopped being cruel to the Crystal Kingdom's enemies." I gestured. "Your only chance to live longer than a week at most is to surrender to us, all of you, and turn State's evidence. You do that, I'll make sure you don't do more than a dime in minimum security. Behave yourself, you're out after a nickel." Ten year sentence, five with good behavior. "No conspiracy or treason charges. Just the kidnapping and anything else in there." I shrugged. "Though, if I was you, I'd already've burnt all the hard copies of the evidence."

Don Gioncarlo: "Y-Yeah.." He shook his head. "Lord Sombra..?"

K: "Can still drain your soul essence. He's an Alicorn, now, and he has full control of his Black Heart powers.. with none of the drawbacks." I tilted my head a bit. "He's already on his way with the Crystal Kingdom Aero Marines. The same ones that busted up that Herdiet Special Forces Brigade last month. Airships, though, they take a few days. I mean, we got plenty of hay and coffee, we could just wait for him to show up and suck your souls out.." I gestured dismissively. "..either way, we're getting Sunrise back. Question is, are you going to be alive, dead, or worse?"

Don Gioncarlo: "I gotta put this to a vote!" He exclaimed, tapping his hoof on the ground. "My mooks're like your troops, K. I makes the choices, but big stuff like this?" He looked at his bodyguard. "What about them?"

K: "Same sentence as you." I nodded. "Keep in mind, my word carries weight. I say so, that's the sentence you get." I glanced back at Inspector Broncomil. "Your problem is, Broncomil out there should have the rest of your organization in the can after five years." I gestued. "But, I'm sure a patron of the arts such as you has.. resources.. he can retire on, comfortably?"

Don Gioncarlo: "Yehh.. Yehh! I getcha! Alright. Lemme go talk to the colts. Put this to a vote. Gimme an hour?" He held out his right hoof.

K: "One hour." I extended my hand, and shook his hoof.

Don Gioncarlo: "Excellent! I don't know why Rep said youse was a bloodthirsty savage. Shows me, listenin' to that runt." He snorted, and nodded to his bodyguard.

They went back to the mansion, and I signalled SWAT to hold position as I walked back to Broncomil.

K: "He goes in for a dime, out in five. You got five years to tear down his entire operation. I'll see you get whatever resources you need, to do it." I nodded to him.

Insp. Broncomil: "I'll take it. Five years with no Don Gio? Heh. I'll have their organization torn down in-"

Dash: "Ten. Seconds. Flat." She patted him on the shoulder. "Drive like yours? I can see it!" She gave him a confident grin.

Insp. Broncomil: *Ha-ha* "Thank you, young lady. That actually means a lot." He grinned.

K: "He's taking a vote, now. I have a feeling... they'll accept my generous offer." I shrugged.

An hour later, Don Gioncarlo and his entire upper command walked out of the mansion peacefully. Hands in the air. Weapons deposited in a pile by the front door. The Don himself, his two Underbosses, five of his Capos, seven of their Lieutenants, eighteen Made Men (Soldiers), and two dozen Associates (the mooks).

Don Gio himself escorted Sunrise Smiles out, like a lady. Arm in arm, himself standing tall and proud. He walked over to me, directly - though I had to wave it okay with Dusty.

Don Gioncarlo: "General K. You've outmaneuvered me." He tipped his fedora to Inspector Broncomil. "Inspector.. I surrender to you, personally." He sat and held out his forelegs.

Inspector Broncomil clapped them in irons. Respectfully.

Insp. Broncomil: "You have the right to stay silent, and to legal representation before questioning and during legal proceedings against you. If you cannot afford representation, the Crown will appoint a legal representative at no cost." He nodded. "Gioncarlo Molari, I arrest you in the name of Princess Celestia, for the crimes of kidnapping, racketeering, illegal gambling, illegal prostitution, corruption of public officials, and third degree murder of a representative of the former Committee of Safety."

Splash: "Third Degree murder, here, is defined as contracting another person to carry out a murder in your name. The definition of 'contracting' being open to interpretation - either by direct employment of a person so specialized that draws regular salary, or by offering a one-time payment.. with some adjustments." She nodded a bit.

K: "I see.. former partner of yours, Inspector?" I tilted my head.

Insp. Broncomil: "My brother, actually." He looked at me with a bit of sadness in his eyes, but a firm fairness.

Don Gioncarlo: "And let me present her royal highness, Duchess Sunrise." He bowed a little.

Sunrise: "I.." She shook her head. "I had.."

K: "Don't worry about anything right now." I put a hand on her shoulder. "Let us get you out of here, and back to Ponyville. Your brother wants to see you again." I gave her a bit of a smile.

Sunrise: "...okay..." She didn't seem upbeat about this.

Still, she was rescued. That was enough for me. We could worry about the details later. For now, she was safe and sound. I hoped Sunshine and her would at least have a.. relatively painless reunion. Like everything in this war, the ending here wasn't perfect, but we did okay.
