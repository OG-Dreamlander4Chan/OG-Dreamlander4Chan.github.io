Part 1: Limnos Space

TIME: 08:47 EET
DATE: War Day 1041/8 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Island of Limnos, Principality of Vulpesylvania


The village area was quickly pacified of enemy forces. Either they were killed by the Marine Infantry, artillery from the ships, or fled. We started searching the village for any of the Foxes that lived here.

Colgate: "K! Over here!" She called from the Market area.

AJ and I moved over with Captain Silverfish.

There was a patch of blood on the ground that wasn't traceable to any of the combatants. Silverfish gave it a sniff, and nodded.

Cat. Silverfish: "That's Fox blood, for sure." He looked over at me.

Colgate: "There's enough here for a pretty serious wound." She shrugged. "Fluttershy, RD, come here." She motioned to them.

Fluttershy: "Alright." She nodded.

Rainbow Dash: "Man, this sucks. We didn't get here in time." She scowled.

Colgate: "Yeah, this stain is days old and dried up." She shook her head.

Vigilance: "I really, REALLY hope they didn't kill them." He frowned.

K: "That would make it an Ethnic Cleansing incident." Knowing they wouldn't understand, I explained. "One of the greater sins Humans commit on each other is the attempted eradication of all persons within a nation or culture - an Ethnic Group, like Pegasi or Terran - including civilans, to ensure their bloodlines cease for all time, and their culture is entirely erased." I shrugged. "I don't think the Macedonkians would do that naturally, but if Vig's right, and Tirek spurred this on somehow, then I could see Tirek insisting on as much Ethnic Cleansing as possible. Foxes, to him, are competition, and a threat. Same with Canids. They're naturally hunters, not slaves or beasts of burden. They WILL rebel at every chance. Sooo.. it might be better if he ordered their virtual extermination." I gestured.

Capt. Silverfish: "That's just diabolical." He growled a bit.

K: "Yeah." Was all I said, my tone somber.

Capt. Silverfish: "Well, I suppose since I'm senior Marine here, I need to learn how to command.. even in the face of something like this." He shrugged a little.

K: "Indeed." I nodded. "Stick close." I looked to Vigilance. "When we start the operation, you and Colgate go with First Lieutenant Goldcream and advise her."

Vigilance: "You got it, K." He nodded firmly.

Colgate: "Long way from Marelin." She smiled a bit. "You know, my husband joined the Rangers because I insisted on joining as a Medic?" She nodded to Captain Silverfish.

Capt. Silverfish: "No kidding? Huh." He smiled a bit. "My mate is at home with my Kits."

We continued the search of the village, but found no further trace of its inhabitants. This took us another couple of hours. Once we were done, we had a commander's meeting at the town hall.

K: "Captain Silverfish, Lieutenant Goldencream, you're going to each take half the Marines, and execute a pincer's movement around the edges of the island. Our goal is the capture or elimination of the enemy force." I nodded to them, studying an old map. "Vigilance will be with you, Lieutenant. Listen to him and Colgate - they have a wealth of combat experience. Captain, I'll be with you. Vig, take Rarity and Toola. I'll take AJ, Fluttershy, Sunset, and R-D." I patted my wife on the shoulder.

Vigilance: "Mm. Alright." He nodded. "Sherby's got us covered sea-side."

K: "Sherby sent the Cutters to circle the island. He has the Crusiers a bit further out, looking for marks. If we can ambush a ship of theirs, we might be able to get some information. Or another ship to use." I shrugged. "Piracy."

Viliance: "Piracy!" He smirked.

Capt. Silverfish: "I've informed the platoon commanders." He nodded. "The island circuits we're looking at are about 30 miles of walking, each."

K: "Alright. We'll take things in three, ten mile increments. And we'll meet up here. Moúdhros. Tomorrow, about noon, if nothing gets in the way." I shrugged a bit. "Check in with the Ships every five miles, if nothing else happens. If we lose communications for any reason, we'll get to Moúdhros first and capture it, then head for the last known position of the other team." I traced the map.

Capt. Silverfish: "Alright." He nodded. "I suppose we don't have any reserve?"

K: "Brazier and Bellicose will be arriving soon - but that's only 12 extra Marines." I nodded. "Two squads. That's it."

Capt. Silverfish: "Understood." He nodded.

K: "Alright, let's get going. Make sure your troops have plenty of water and three meals." I nodded to Lieutenant Goldencream.

1LT Goldencream: "Aye, sir." She nodded, and moved off.

Capt. Silverfish: "Odd that. Three meals?" He shrugged.

K: "We might get some Forage, we might not. Either way, Moúdhros will be reached - unless there's trouble - by Noon tomorrow. If we have to resupply by ship, we can. But if we're just chasing them towards the center, I don't want to have to stop, get food off the ships, eat, then start back up again. As much speed as we can muster." I nodded, as I rolled up the map.

Capt. Silverfish: "You speak as though you think no one's left on the island." He frowned.

K: "They might not be. We don't know. We have to think in terms of that being the case. That and, if this is so, that the Macedonkians picked the island clean of supplies for themselves." I gestured. "While they don't eat fish, they do eat other things. Do you recall seeing anything BUT meat and fish in our search of the town?"

Capt. Silverfish: "Yeah.. you're right." He frowned. "Alright, I'll go get our detachment ready." He moved off.

Applejack: "Empty?" She frowned at me. "Y'all ain't tellin' him?"

Rainbow Dash: "Kinda mean keeping him in the dark like that, K." She frowned, too.

Sunset: "..probably better they DON'T know." She shrugged. "Do YOU want to tell them that there's a chance Tirek took them all for Rainbow Extraction, and NOT Ethnic Cleansing?"

Rarity: "It.." She frowned, and went sullen. "..is indeed easier to think they were all murdered, rather than extracted, should that be the case, darlings." And went cold. "It had better not be."

Toola Roola: "..I'm not sure." She blinked, looking at the ground. "I mean.. I can't tell. I'm not getting anything." And shrugged.

Fluttershy: "Well, it can't be helped." She wing-hugged Toola. "Come on, let's help make sure both units are prepared."

Toola Roola: "Yeah.." She trailed off a bit, slightly disturbed that her precognative ability was not telling her anything.

Sunset: "Yeah, this is REALLY starting to feel like Tirek's doing." She frowned. "Why, though? Why would the Macedonkians do this?"

K: "Promise of land. And the Elites get Tirek's favor - they think - if/when Tirek wins. He WON'T, but they don't know that. They ALSO don't know that Tirek is going to stab them in the back the second they outlive their usefulness. As for Tirek himself, we screwed up his plan of having an alliance with a being about his power level, and proved that power had no brain behind it. He needs a back up plan to keep delaying us." I shrugged.

Sunset: "From getting the Rainbow of Light." She nodded. "Which we still need to find."

K: "Yep. I'm starting to think it's back in Eqeustria somewhere." I gestured. "Anyway, let's get ourselves set to go."

There was a lot to think about. We could discern Tirek's motives, and those of his new puppets, but we also knew we needed to get some space so we could complete our mission of acquiring the Rainbow of Light. Without it, the conclusion to this war was going to be VERY bad indeed.

Part 2: Limnos Star

TIME: 16:33 EET
DATE: War Day 1041/8 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Nearing the City of Mírina, Island of Limnos, Principality of Vulpesylvania


We had Brazier off the coast from us. Our unit was following the coast of Limnos, trying to ascertain the disposition of the residents, and any enemy forces. We had encountered some Macedonkians at long range, but none remained for a fight. They would retreat without firing a shot. I suspected they were simply keeping tabs on us.

We were getting close to the small city of Mírina, the capital of the island. None of the island's settlements were especially large, so, I didn't think it all that necessary to muster the entire Company for any single one. This was an investigation, primarily.

Capt. Silverfish: "General." He paced up. "We're almost to the city." He nodded to a paddock of sheep nearby. "These are the farms on the edge of town."

K: "Alright. Break up into Squads, check the farms." I pointed. "I'll take the girls and scout ahead." I nodded.

Capt. Silverfish: "Roger." He moved to direct his unit.

Sunset: "Alright, Kay." She smiled a bit. "Let's go!"

Fluttershy: "..we still haven't seen any other foxes.." She said, solemnly.

Rainbow Dash: "They're probably just hiding! Come on, they've been INVADED, Fluttershy, and not all of them had guns. The militia has to worry about the civilians' safety, first." She shrugged her wings. "They probably went to the interior of the island. There's a pretty dense forest there, right?"

Applejack: "Ah hope yer right, Sugarcube. I really, really do." She frowned.

K: "Let's move." I nodded.

My party moved out ahead by a good bit. We bypassed the smaller farms and moved towards the edge of the more settled part of town. NOW we could see some signs of.. something. Carts were overturned, there were random bullet holes in walls, some blood spatter..

..no bodies, though.

Applejack: "..aw, this ain't good, everypony." She held up a Herdiet 7.92x44mm rifle case in her teeth, then spat it back out. "Ah don't see no NEIGHTO cases around here." She shrugged. "Looks like the bad guys got here first, an' started shootin'.."

Sunset: "..Kay! Over here!" Sh said in hushed tones, looking in a window.

We moved over quickly, with R-D popping up to provide cover.

In the window, we could see a carefully ransacked store. Almost all the edible goods were gone, save some of the preserved meats and fruits. We spotted two little Kits inside. The larger of the two was using his teeth to rip up a slab of preserved fish, and make the pieces small enough for the smaller one to eat. The smaller one looked very hungry, they were both very dirty, and they'd lost some weight.

K: "..." I made a noise that was pure parental anguish.

Fluttershy: "I'm on it." She said, without any hesitation.

She got her combat knife out and gently wedged the window open, then slid in very quietly. She trotted slowly over to the two Kits, and gently set her canteen cup with water in it, next to them. The two looked up at her, and looked ready to cry. No words. They hugged her forelegs, and clung to her with desperation.

K: "Coming in." I said, vaulting the low window sill.

I let my Grant go slack, and pushed it behind me, before approaching. The two Kits ceased hugging Fluttershy, and looekd up at me.

K: "Can either of you talk?" I said in the most fatherly tone I could muster.

Larger Kit: "Aw kihn tawk." Baby babble..

K: "How old are you?" I said, trying to keep my voice from cracking.

Larger Kit: "Ahwm FOUR!" He said, proudly.

Yeah, and if we hadn't come along, he would never have seen five.

Larger Kit: "Lil' Sis iz tweo!" He nudged her with his muzzle. "S-She.. need heylp!"

K: "Fluttershy." I said, softly.

She was already on it, having broken out her mess kit, and mixed up something the poor Kit could digest better.

AJ: "Ah'm in, honeybun." She slid over to the larger kit. "Howdy, sugarcube. I'm Applejack." She said without her usual fervor, and a strong motherly tone.

Larger Kit: "Ah'm Tod! Todddrrick Calah.. calah.. Calaminis!" He said, working to remember his full name.

AJ: "Where's y'all's ma'n'pa?" She asked, tenderly.

Tod: "Duh nassy Donkees. Died'em." He grew sullen, and hugged his tail. "Everyone else? Took't 'm."

K: "Where?" I really, REALLY had to dig my fingernails into my hands to keep my voice from cracking.

Tod: "Awn'a boat. This mornin! Head'n norff!" He nodded, looking at me.

THERE. WAS. HOPE.

I bolted up, and made for the window.

K: C> "Alpha to Roberts! COME IN!"

Sherby: C> "Roberts. Go."

K: C> "Call all available fleet and air arm elements - we have civilian cargo or passenger ships headed north from Limnos as of eight hours ago. They'll be close to the Macedonkain Coast. INTERCEPT AND CAPTURE AT ALL COSTS! The entire population of the island was removed for EXTRACTION!" I paused.. well, here goes the secret. "Sherb.. they're.. if you don't save them.. they're going to have the rainbow extracted from them. Please, Sherb.." My voice finally broke.

Sherby: C> *Fiercely determined* "Roberts acknowledges. Retasking task force. I'll report in when I can. Roberts, out."

As I found out later, he transferred his flag to Bellicose and took off at a straight run for the Macedonkian Coast, calling in both VMS Argolis, and SMS Prague to assist.

I looked back and Fluttershy was cuddling both of the Kits close to her.

K: "..they're yours. If.." I couldn't finish that sentence.

Fluttershy: "He'll have to marry me, now." She said, in low tones. "I'm a mother." She nuzzled Tod with her snoot.

K: C> "Alpha to Victor-One-One." I looked back at the window.

Capt. Silverfish: C> "Victor. Go, Alpha."

K: C> "Move into the city. The enemy has withdrawn."

Capt. Silverfish: C> "Aye, Alpha."

K: C> "Alpha to Brazier."

HMS Brazier Comspony: C> "Go, Alpha."

K: C> "Swing around at high speed towards the port facility at Moúdhros. I suspect the enemy is preparing to withdraw by boat. Accept surrender if possible, sink them if they refuse. Don't dilly dally on making that choice, though. Give any enemy vessels sixty seconds to strike their colors. If they don't, sink them." I nodded.

HMS Brazier Comspony: C> "Aye-Aye, sir. Roger that, Alpha."

K: "Sunset, hand me the long range pack." I held my hand out, as she handed me the Mic. C> "Alpha to Victor Two-One and Alpha Five-Five."

Vigilance: C> "Roger. Go, Alpha."

K: C> "Pack it in and head straight for Moúdhros. The enemy is evacuating the island. They GOT what they CAME for, Vig." He would know what that meant.

Vigilance: C> "..Roger, Alpha. We'll get there."

K: C> "Alpha, out." I shrugged, looking at the girls, who were all in the building, now.

Sunset: "So, that fight at the village was just a delaying action, until they could get the last of the Foxes onto their ships from HERE, and get them off the island?" She shrugged as she stuck the mic back.

K: "More or less." I nodded. "The goal was the foxes, not the island. The island would be simply re-inhabited later by Donkeys, when they won. This certainly solves the question of how they were going to take over any captured territory - ship the Foxes to a Rainbow Factory, sell them to Tirek. And get their occupied lands emptied of former inhabitants, while keeping the structures intact." I shrugged wide.

Rainbow Dash: "Diabolical!" She hissed. "But, it makes a lot of sense." She shook her head. "With all the foxes removed, they can just hand out the property." And shrugged.

Applejack: "Man, that's jes'.." She snorted, but it was a pained snort, of a parent.

Dash gave her a wing hug.

Rainbow Dash: "We'll save 'em." She reassured her friend. "Sherby's on it, and HE'S AWESOME!" She puffed herself up.

Sunset: "As I'm learning." She nodded with a smile. "So, K, what's our next move?"

K: "Well, we can march all night and get straight to Moúdhros. But, Lieutenant Goldcream's unit can get there in just a couple of hours. They SHOULD be at Pourniá, which is five miles from Moúdhros, if they weren't going to take that extra long circuit around the island's edge." I paused. "About eight kilometers." I nodded.

Remember, the Foxes use Imperial units customarily.

Sunset: "Alright." She nodded. "So, we stay HERE tonight, or..?" She shrugged.

K: "May as well. Our formation needs rest. We'll call in the Cutters to transport us to the Fishing Village in the morning, since 'searching' the island is no longer necessary." I shrugged, as Captain Silverfish stuck his head in the window. "Captain, disperse the troops, the Macedonkains have left the island, by my reckoning. We bed down for the night, and get a lift by sea to the Fishing Village in the morning." I nodded to him.

Capt. Silverfish: "Aye, sir." He nodded, and went to step away, then paused. "The.. my Marines want an explanation, sir. What you said to Commander McSherbet."

K: "..I'll give them one, once they've had supper." I shrugged. "Grab whatever you need from the stores, just make sure to leave payment behind from His Majesty's Government in compensation. They're coming back." I was firm with that last sentence.

Capt. Silverfish: "Aye-Aye, General." He nodded, and moved off.

Applejack: "Secret's comin' out, now, honeybun." She frowned.

K: "Celestia won't be happy. We wanted to keep this a secret for a reason. We'll have to be very careful about how we release this to the press.." I frowned.

Sunset: "Oh, I think we know JUST the MARE to help us." Elsie, she meant.

So, now, the secret of the Rainbow Factories was on the brink of becoming public knowledge. That wasn't good. But, we also now had plenty of proof that the Herdiets may have supplied the Macedonkians, but it was in fact Tirek that was the instigator of this invasion.

I needed to get back to Athens.

Part 3: Personal Business in the Middle of a War

TIME: 07:13 EET
DATE: War Day 1042/9 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Athens, Principality of Vulpesylvania


Most of CAG that wasn't busy assisting front line units, or were returning for refit, were here in the capital. As I found out, timely deployment of mechanized units and vehicles had halted the Macedonkian advance into Vulpe territory, but they were now at a stalemate. As in World War I, the Macedonkians had moved up light artillery to use as direct fire anti-tank guns, despite not having dedicated AP shells. This, in turn, blunted the Vulpe counter attack.

As we got from the Naval Port to the Palace, we took a detour. Two now-clean and better-fed Kits were riding on Fluttershy as we looked for our friends. It didn't take us long to find them.

K: "Broken!" I called out.

Broken Dawn trotted right over, with a small grin. His uniform was positively filthy, but he was none the worse for wear.

Broken Dawn: "Ah, K!" He tapped his hooves. "How'd it go?! Did you MEET them?!"

K: "We did. Nice lot." I nodded. "Golden?"

Broken Dawn: "Just went to get some food. Gaze and Norfy had us commanding Mechanized Infantry Companies." He shrugged. "Most of our vehicles were damaged or knocked out, but we accomplished our objectives. We're waiting on repairs and whatever we can get for replacement."

K: "Alright." I nodded.. then slowly nodded to Fluttershy.

She looked up at Broken Dawn and blushed, as Dusk came in with Golden.

Rarity: "Ah-Ah-ahhhhhhh, darling!" She put a hoof out as Dusk came over to her with a kissy face. "Wait."

Dusk: "Oh?" He tilted his head.

K: "Golden." I nodded to him, put a hand on his shoulder, and pulled him aside.

Golden Wattle: "Yeah, K?" He tilted his head at me, wondering if he was being disciplined for the losses.

K: "How much do you love her?" I was direct.

He froze up. Blinked, coughed, and tried to stumble into some kind of placative words, making some noises that weren't actual words, but a tone.

I put a hand to his muzzle.

K: "I mean it." I said, softly, but firmly. "Look. She's adopted two orphan kits. She was going on about how she wants them to have a Dad." I shrugged a bit. "She wants it to be you. But, I don't want to fo-"

Golden Wattle: "AYE!" He stated firmly, raising his head. "A'course I'll marry'er." And smiled.. then looked down, blushing hard. "Ah'love her, yeah.." He rubbed his right foreleg with his left, sheepishly. "..th'thought we'd.. be parents, y'know?" And smiled harder.

K: "Then do it, man!" I hissed at him, encouragingly.

He gave me a firm nod, a smile, and walked back over to Fluttershy.

Golden Wattle: "Ah.. F-Fluttershy.. I.." He looked down and away a moment, then crouched, looking up at her, and pulling out a simple silver hoof band. "I.. I ain't gotta speech ready, but.. I love you. Ah'll awl'ways love you. Would'ya make me th' happiest stallion on Equus, an'.. give me yer hoof in marriage?"

Fluttershy: "Of course." She smiled back at him. "I wouldn't have anyone else." She accepted the band around her hoof. "This is Tod and Maria." She nuzzled the dozing kits on her back. "Kids? This is Daddy.."


TIME: 09:22 EET
LOCATION: Royal Palace, Athens, Principality of Vulpesylvania


I managed to find Elsie. I had to explain everything to her from scratch. She wasn't happy to hear the full truth about things, but she promised to treat this as a very sensitive matter. The truth would come out, but Elise would break the news very carefully, and explain things as softly as possible.

I knew this would lead to more outrage among our forces, but with Elsie's delicate pen, they wouldn't go over the edge and rage or despair TOO badly.

After meeting with Elsie, I found the Prince, finally.

K: "Your Highness." I nodded to him.

Prince Stavros: "General K." He nodded. "It went well, I hope?"

K: "Better than I could have imagined." I smiled a bit. "I need to know something, though." I walked over to the planning table, and gestured at the huge map of the area. "Do you intend on retaking the lands lost to you by the Macedonkians and others?"

Prince Stavros: "Perhaps." He nodded. "Argeios was part of the original Vulpian Kingdoms that founded modern Vulpesylvania." He shrugged. "The Macedonkians aren't even origianlly from this area - they're from southern Tarpangoslavia. That's their ancestral home. They were chased out of it long before they came to our lands."

K: "Tarpangoslavia. They're Tarpans, right? A subspecies of horse?" I tilted my head.

Prince Stavros: "Correct." He nodded. "Before the Macedonkians started to.. invasively settle.. they were chased out of southern Tarpangoslavia. They were originally known as the Donkdanians."

K: "The.." I blinked, paused, and thought back to my own history. "..Kingdom of Dardania on Earth. Interesting." I nodded. "Well, we're dealing with a series of displaced peoples. This isn't an easy answer." I gestured at the map again. "When did the whole infiltration and conquest happen, exactly?"

Prince Stavros: "Slowly, very slowly. It started a thousand years ago, but the border changes didn't start until 784 C.S. Small ones at first, then larger ones. The largest was the loss of the Argeios Coast in 899 C.S. which also saw the loss of the interior of the old Argeios Kingdom, and parts of Thrace. The rest of Thrace was taken by the Blowgarians, traded briefly with the Camels, taken back by the Blowgarians, and once invaded by the Macedonkians." He shrugged. "Western Thrace was ours until 901 C.S. when we accepted their demands."

K: "Why did that happen?" I nodded to him.

Prince Stavros: "They settled the lands." He shrugged. "They got violent, threatened us, attacked us, launched all kinds of offensive actions against our infrastructure. Burned crops, sabotaged water, things like that. It's why our National Police is so veteraned - they managed to deal with most of this. The truth is, they've had a larger population for a long time, and we had no force multipliers to give us any real advantage. They've enjoyed the support of the Blowgarians, or Tarpangoslavians, or Shquiptaria, over time, at different times. They've always, as long as our nation has existed in some form, been aligned against us. There was a time about a thousand years ago.. 950 specifically.. when we were all at peace and the lands had plenty for all." He shrugged slowly, and sighed. "Vulpesylvania, you realize, was made up from several smaller Vulpine kingdoms over time. Minosia, Argeios, Thessaly, Thrace, Molossia, and Mycenae. Slowly, we came together. We formed the original Kingdom of Vulpesylvania in 2577 B.C. and controlled everything from Corfu to Byzantae. At that time, there were other tribes around us. We know that they underwent several periods of shifting. Blowgaria, for example, was once on the other side of what's now Macedonkia. Macedonkians, after being evicted from Donkdania, originally moved east. Eventually, they drove the Blowgarians out of what's NOW Macedonkia, but couldn't really hold the lands they once were driven to, and the Blowgarians drove them out."

K: "It sounds like Southern Europe has undergone a lot of transitions over the last three thousand years or so." I shrugged.

Prince Stavros: "And this is just what we know from our own histories. I'm sure there's more. We know that an ancient tribe known as the Keevans once existed north of Thessaly, that the Cossacks once had their own kingdom, that the forebearers of the current Herediet Union - the Roostians - were once focused much further north. We've tried to clarify history as best we can, but our neighbors don't want to share with us, or be good neighbors. They haven't for a few centuries. So, we stayed on guard, and didn't repeat the mistakes of the past. Once the lands started to be traded under threat, we expelled any non-Foxes from our territory. This after our falling out with Roam. We felt the outside world couldn't be trusted at all. So, we focused on ourselves. Then.." He nodded, frowning. "..then, the modern troubles started. Which, largely, we've pinned on Tirek. This being his next step, makes sense to us. The Macedonkians are claiming cultural connection to all of Argeios, and want all of it."

K: "Do they have a real claim, though?" I shrugged.

Prince Stavros: "That's.. tricky. They did invade and invasively settle in Argeios, and the history says that they did adapt of its culture, but added in their own. So, what CAN you call them? An evolved fusion of Donkdanian and Argeiosian Culture that arose as a result of their actions in this area, creating modern Macedonkian Culture? Or are they Donkdanians that grafted on some Argeiosian cultural tidbits and only use this as an excuse to claim to be the true successors to Argeios?" He shrugged, and again gestured at the map. "It's the position of our government that the original Six Kingdoms Pact that created Vulpesylvania entitles us to claim full cultural and practical sovereignty over the territories of the former constituent kingdoms."

K: "In short, the lands they took, you want back." I nodded to him.

Prince Stavros: "I would have accepted their demands and ignored them in favor of Tirek. But, they have attacked by force of arms, and demand ALL of the lands. And our subdjugation, my execution.." He shook his head. "..they want to fight. I would very much like to take this chance to at least get back everything in Central Argeios and all of Thrace up to the modern Blowgarian border. Not necessarily to punish them, but to reclaim what was very recently ours. Compensation for this attack, and a correction of the mistakes of my predecessors."

K: "I'll have to consult with NEIGHTO." I nodded. "Defensive operations are one thing - but I need to know if the Membership thinks this becoming an Offensive action constitutes a second conflict, and whether or not they want to get into the messy business of backing territorial claims."

Prince Stavros: "I'll be frank. My Foxes are willing to commit to this, but we have no hope of succeeding if NEIGHTO doesn't at least guaranatee the protection of our pre-invasion territory. In short, if NEIGHTO doesn't watch our backs, we haven't the force needed to succeed." He shrugged. "If they want to restrict themselves to only guarding our territory, but do so with aplomb, I can take whatever force I have, and attempt to invade the enemy's lands alone. I'll have enough force freed up to make a decent attempt at it. And if allowed, I will." He tapped his paw on the map, over where Thrace was. "I will not, however, attack the Blowgarians if they do not attack us first. Only the Macedonkians."

K: "I understand." I nodded. "Going after the invading nations' own territories as a part of a larger strategy, then keeping some of it as conquest, is a legitimate method of conducting a war in Human Land." I gestured a bit. "And you do - I think - have at least a legitimate claim to all of Thrace, since they never claimed to be Thracian. They already took Thrace from you by Right of Conquest. So, why NOT take the connecting lands as well? They WERE yours." I patted the map. "However, I will not make a case for this to NEIGHTO - not my opinion. I will state the facts, state the historic precedents, and ask them to come to their own conclusions without my influence. Because, I admit, I have a lot of pull with most of the NEIGHTO leaders." I shrugged. "I don't want them to commit to an invasion JUST because General K says he WANTS to, I want them to genuinely believe and trust that this is the correct course of action from their own hearts."

Prince Stavros: "Fair and equal." He nodded. "Your reputation is accurate, General K. I accept this."

K: "If NEIGHTO will agree to territorial protection while you aim to retake lost lands, I volunteer to help lead your forces." I shrugged. "I can at least do that for one of Havoc's friends."

Prince Stavros: "Oh?" He blinked. "Well, we shall see." He then smiled.

This was going to get politically complex, fast. I'd have to Conference with NEIGHTO's leaders as soon as possible, so we had a clear course of action ahead of us. Especially with the rest of NEIGHTO arriving with forces in the next several days.

Part 4: The Question

TIME: 08:11 EET
DATE: War Day 1043/10 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Governmental Administration Building, Taranto, Empire of Roam


Conference. The leaders of Germaneigh, Prance, Ambelion, Roam, Poleland, Equestria, the Crystal Kingdom, Canida, Navarre, the Griffon Kingdom, Harmonia, the Neigtherlands, and Hippogriffia were all here.

Shortly, we'd be having a debate about what to do about the Vulpine question - do we back their territorial claims, and assist them in retaking Thrace and Argeios? Do we remain in "armed defensive neutrality" of their country, and allow them to conduct the offensive themselves? Or do we only permit NEIGHTO forces to be used until the pre-invasion borders are restored?

Princess Celestia: "K." She came right up to me and swept me aside into a small room. The first thing I got was a friendly kiss, then a hug. "I've been told Aphrodite herself wanted a piece of you."

K: "Oh, come now, Celly. You know you and Luna're the only Goddesses for me." I gave her a 'daddy flirt with mommy' eyebrow wiggle.

She giggled, and wing-hugged me.

Princess Celestia: "Really. I was so worried. Hearing all these reports of you narrowly escaping death." She shook her head. "Anyway. I want to hear your opinion on this."

K: "I can't give it." I nodded. "I'm giving a factual analysis of the combat conditions and the realities of the war. That's it. I do NOT want Pony Politics to be shaded by human influence."

Princess Celestia: "..oh." She blinked, and hugged me AGAIN. "Thank you, for that."

K: "You're awfully clingy." I caressed her cheek.

Princess Celestia: *Mumbles* "..going into estrus.." *COUGH*

K: *Whispered* "YOU!? At your age!?" I smiled in surprise.

Princess Celestia: "I-It happens to even me." She raised her head. "After all, my SISTER decided to create issue." And she shrugged her wings.

K: "You.. ahh.. wanna have a private conference when this is over, then?" I cleard my throat a bit. "I can.. tell you about my.. invasion plans.." I smirked.

Princess Celestia: "Oh. Yes. My general. Indeed." She cleared her throat. "I can't believe this is happening." She looked down, smiling, but a tad embarassed. "At MY age." And shrugged her wings. "I suppose this is what happens when.." She used her wing to lift my chin. "..I actually find a soul that I care about on that level. Even if we're not compatible in that way." She made a small sigh. "Or, for that matter, compatible for a real married relationship." And shrugged again. "It's still so nice to have.. another parent."

K: "It's my honor, Celly." I hugged her neck. "For what it's worth, I care, too." And I held the hug a bit too long. "I really do. I'll never forget you."

Princess Celestia: "Same. I don't think anyone ever will." She smiled.

I had no idea what the future would hold, however.

In the conference room, everyone was assembled. I was shocked to see who was representing Harmonia.

K: "SVEN!?" I about lost my balance.

Sven: "Oh, hey, d'ere!" He was so casual about it.

K: "Oh, my God. It's been years." I went right over to him, and gave him a hug. "YOU!?"

Sven: "Jae." He cackled. "I was elected!" He shrugged. "Dae East an' West wanna unite as one. D'ey t'ink ol' Sven, since he goo't at fixin' things, can fix d'is." He nodded sagely. "I trys, K."

K: "Couldn't ask for anyone better." I smiled.

Prince Hoffnungsteyer: "General K." He clopped a hoof on my shoulder as he took his seat.

K: "Prince." I nodded to him.

Princess Celestia: "Let's come to order. Our most.. perhaps troubling.. decision lies before us. A NEIGHTO member has territorial claims on another nation. They were willing to forego those claims as long as peace was upheld. However, they have been attacked. Currently, the battle is in stalemate, and the initial intense fighting has died down. Soon, our reinforcements will be in position to retake the invaded territory." She looked at the assembled world leaders. "Once that is done, however, Prince Stavros has expressed a desire to retake the lands lost to them a little over 100 years ago." She shrugged her wings. "We must decide. Do we recognize these territorial claims? Do we aide our ally in retaking these claims? Do we simply defend NEIGHTO territory, but allow them to pursue these claims with their own forces only? Or do we discourage these claims, and.." She looked at Prince Stavros. "..withdraw our NEIGHTO forces if they attempt to conduct offensive operations?" She nodded to me. "General K will give us a field report and analysis."

K: "Mares and Gentlecolts." I nodded to them all. "Canid and Foxen." I gestured. "Right now, the Vulpesylvanian Forces have taken about 33% materiel losses in defending from the sudden invasion, and the enemy - the Non-Aligned Movement - is at a standstill. Right now, with the infusion of the rest of the Equestrian Marine forces that had been forward deployed to Roam, the Roaman 1st Infantry Division's leading Brigade, and the Marinekampftruppe brought by Germaneigh, the enemy still outnumbers NEIGHTO troops about 5 to 1. However, we posses superior combat experience and technology. We also have strike aircraft - they do not. The Vulpines can field about two Divisions of troops, with reserve call-ups, Militia, and so on, should they make a total commitment. The Macedonkians have about five field divisions in total, with three committed to the offensive, one in reserve in the center, and one holding the line in Argolis, which they call South-East Macedonkia. This is in addition to what might be another Division and a half of local Militia of unknown constitution." I paced over to the main map of the area. "If the enemy is thrown out of Vulpe territory with significant enough losses, the Vulpes have the capability of attempting to retake Thrace. However, they will need some time to set up their primary combat divison, prepare for navalized landings behind enemy lines with Marines, and to empty out their local militia units, mobilize them, and set them up for occupational and rear echelon duties." I indicated the map with my finger. "The Macedonkians, Tarpangs, and Shquiptrians seem to be united in this offensive, but the Macedonkians seem.. to almost be left alone in terms of defense. I believe that if we inflict severe casualties on the allied nations to Macedonkia, we can force their withdrawl from the field, and if severe ENOUGH, we can get them to sue for peace one at a time, leaving Macedonkia isolated." I paced to the other side of the map. "Once done, or if we can simply hold the line as a force-in-being, it should take about a month or so for the Vulpes to capture all the territory of Thrace up to the Blowgarian border. They have no intention of attacking a neutral nation, despite territorial claims to the city of Byzante and Eastern Thrace." I folded my hands. "I think they can do it. However, they have no hope of success if they must also defend their northern border themselves." I nodded. "I will say, we are certain that Tirek is indeed behind the Macedonkians' sudden aggression." I shrugged. "The evidence we uncovered is... very troubling. Even without the agreement that NEIGHTO in some way backs the territorial claims of the Vulpines, we will have to launch a special operations mission into Thrace to neutralize a specific threat."

Senatus Veloce: "What is your opinion on'a thees matter, K?" He asked, plainly.

K: "I refuse to give an answer, Senatus." I bowed to him. "I do not want Pony Politics to be shaded in ANY WAY by human opinion." I gestured. "You all trust me as Supreme Allied Commander. I refuse to let my opinions of what should be done politically, to interfere with that. SAC should not be a politician. Negotiator, yes, but purely in support of NEIGHTO's mission, and peace. Whomever becomes SAC after me, should follow this example - give you the military reality of the situation, but never once take a position on the 'yes' or 'no' - and equally, you should all make choices like this based on what's best for both your own nations, and NEIGHTO as a whole. Not based on the opinion of a single person." I clasped my hands before me and bowed to them. "I will answer only military related questions, nothing more."

Princess Margaret: "We truly were blessed to have you here, K." She smiled. "You could easily have told us what you think is best, and we likely would have gone along with it." She nodded. "Well, everyone. Let us discuss the matter."

Discuss they did. For several hours. Prince Stavros passionately made his case. I explained, finally, what the Rainbow Factories were, to the assembled NEIGHTO partners (and they were indeed very shocked that this was true). I also explained that Rainbow McSherbet's capture of the civilian passenger liners that had been converted into prisoner carriers, revealed that there was indeed a Rainbow Factory in Thrace, and thus, this entire war was likely an excuse by Tirek to acquire more... "living resources" to power the Rainbow of Darkness.

This really put them on edge. They all immediately agreed that, at the very least, a special operations mission would be called for (entirely at my discretion) to remove it from existence. The question of territory was hotly debated. Mainly, would NEIGHTO make a habit of this, or was this a one time thing, based purely on circumstance? It was clear that the NEIGHTO nations had some of their own issues with territorial claims and the intricacies of that, which had largely been ignored for the last few hundred years, in the name of peace.

Mainly, they didn't want to be hypocrites.

In the end, though, Prince Hoffnungsteyer immediately renounced any previous administrations' territorial claims anywhere. Princess Escargot did the same. This freed up Princess Wilhelmina, who, in the end, voted to back the territorial claims of Vulpesylvania. However, the total vote did not align with that.

Germaneigh voted to provide "robust defense" of Vulpine territory. As did Roam, Canida, and Prance. Princess Margaret was very vocal on her opinion that whatever support was needed, they could provide it, and agreed with Prince Hoffnungsteyer.


King Gorcat promised that whatever the decision was, he'd send a combat brigade to Europe immediately, for whatever duties. However, he abstained from voting, as he knew that Griffonic aggression had ruffled many feathers over several generations, and he didn't want his administration to start out by looking aggressive.

Harmonia refused to vote, as Sven stated, they had no skin in the game, yet, and their first field division was still in training.

Queen Novo likewise refused to vote - she backed Prince Hoffnungsteyer in spirit, but as she had no forces to commit, she felt she had no place to vote officially, yet.

King Solarenski likewise abstained, as he felt his nation, and he personally, were too involved in the situation politically, as it was, since the Non-Aligned Movement shared a border with him.


Princess Celestia and Princess Cadence voted with Princess Wilhelmina, feeling that Prince Stavros' claim was valid, and given that he was now attacked, he had every right to retake the territory stolen from his people, many years ago.


Emperor no Ken voted to "hold the line" only - restore Vulpesylvania's pre-invasion borders, but not fully back their claim, or provide much assistance.

King Condor-Alfonso agreed, and pushed that a peace agreement bew reached with all the aggressor nations when possible, but encouraged "severe consequences" to their military forces until then, and then promised one field division of Navarese troops - largely Civil War veterans.

Both, however, promsied to support whatever decision was reached.


In the end, the vote was:

In Favor of Supporting Vulpesylvania's Terriorial Claims: 3

In Favor of Defending Vulpesylvania, and allowing them to go on the offensive with logistical support: 5

Disfavoring any effort by Vulpesylvania to invade Macedonkia: 2

Abstain: 4


Prince Stavros: "..so, what, then?" He stood, and shrugged, after the vote was cast.

King Condor-Alfonso: "We will support the mayority decision, senior." He nodded. "But retaking territory must be on your own." He nodded to me. "I have a feeling you will have friends, though."

K: "I have.. volunteered my services, yes." I shrugged. "General Sacquet will be interim SAC, and Commandant Forest Spirit will be interim Equestrian C-in-C until I return. IF.. this body will permit me a.. working vacation." I shrugged, coyly.

Daishiro: "Ov course, my friend." He grinned. "It is de r'least we can do. You fought so hahrd for each ov us." He shrugged, smirking smugly.

Princess Celestia: "Then, it is decided." She nodded. "NEIGHTO will not officially assist Vulpesylvania in retaking their lost territory from a century ago, but we will provide for the defense of the nation in the absence of their own armed forces while they make the attempt independently. We will also undertake a special mission to eliminate the Rainbow Factory in enemy territory, and expend every resource to assure the destruction of it, and any supporting facilites."

Prince Stavros: "I thank all of you, on behalf of my people." He bowed to them. "General K?" He motioned for me to come over.

I did, and he reached into his pocket, pulling out a small metal case. Inside was a pair of shoulder strap rank insigna, that looked like a Kotinos wreath, with a large gold star in the middle.

Prince Stavros: "By the authority vested in me as Crown Prince of Vulpesylvania, I confer on you the rank of Stratarches." He nodded to me. "I ask you lead us to victory. Friend."

I accepted with a small grin.

SO! Those following along at home, I am now: General-Field Marshal Sir K---- K---. Supreme Allied Commander of NEIGHTO. Commander in Chief of the Equestrain Armed Forces. Stratarches of the Vulpian Armies, Navies, and Air Forces. Colonel of the Neigtherlands Marines. AND Knight of the Crystal Realm.

Somewhere, I knew Kang would be laughing.

And after the conference, I had a delightful surprise of Luna showing up, so, while Kang might be laughing, I had the Sun and Moon... MOANING.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Initiate

TIME: 09:16 EET
DATE: War Day 1044/11 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Athens, Principality of Vulpesylvania


We wouldn't officially be backing Vulpesylvania's territorial claims. However, if they managed to defeat the Macedonkians, NEIGHTO would recognize any post-invasion borders. That being said, a great deal of war materiel was flowing into the port of Athens, and Aitolikón, in Western Vulpesylvania.

The Vulpes had their own series of armored vehicles, but they'd taken losses, and their industrial capacity wasn't at the same level as Equestria or other nations, so, Germaneigh was sending them "spare" light armor and armored fighting vehicles. Heavy tanks wouldn't be usable very well, here, given the terrain.

I arrived back in Athens to see that the Roaman 1st Infantry Division had arrived, along with the Germane 1st Assault Division. That put the odds decidedly back in our favor. While the troops would be green, they have armored fighting vehicles and motor transport. This would also be a great chance for the individual unit commanders to learn their trade.

Equestria had the rest of the 1st Marine Division on the way, but in the meantime, had sent all its most veteraned officers and NCO's that weren't busy, over to Vulpesylvania to act as advisors to those same unit commanders. Mistakes would be made, it was part of warfare, but with this, we would have experienced eyes helping out.

I made my way over to the NEIGHTO Command Center - a large amphitheatre taken over to use as an HQ. LOTS of people were moving this way and that.

K: "Forest Spirit." I nodded to him as I came over. "Once the main fight is done, I want you to take over here, and command the defense once the Vulpes are ready to counterattack and invade Thrace" I pointed to the map. "NEIGHTO Council isn't going to officially back Vulpesylvania's territorial claims, but they won't object to them, either. So, we're taking some volunteers over there to help out, when the time comes." I nodded to him.

Forest Spirit: "Hm." He blinked, lowered his head, and looked over to Spifire. "Hey, Spitfire."

Spitfire: "Yeah?" She shrugged and came over, smiling at me. "K!"

K: "Hey, you." I hugged her. "How's my Air Marshal doing?"

Spitfire: "Just fine." She nodded.

Forest Spirit: "Good. Because when K takes leave as Equestrian C-in-C, and gives command to me, I'm in turn taking leave as well, and giving command to you." He nodded to her, smirking.

Spitfire: "Wh-" She blinked, and almost fainted. "YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!? FOREST SPIRIT, I'M A SHOWPONY! A TRICK FLYER! A TRAINER! NOT A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF!!" She looked horrified.

Forest Spirit: "..and what would you do if K and I both died?" He shrugged. "You're nextmost senior in line - and you've got just as much combat experience." He nodded. "You need to learn how to do my job, just as I needed to learn K's." And put a hoof on her shoulder. "I trust you, Spitfire."

Spitfire: "Ah.." She blinked. "I.. I just.. don't know if I can.." And shrugged, as Soarin' came up.

Soarin: "I got your back, boss." He gave her a one-foreleg hug. "We'll do it together." He nodded to me. "Right, Cousin?"

K: "Right." I nodded to him with a smile. "You okay? I finally get to ask."

Soarin: "I'll.." He twitched a bit, and looked down. "..never really be fully okay, but.." He looked at me. "Braeburn wouldn't want me to sit this war out, wallowing in self pity." He nodded firmly. "Balindra cleared me for duty - I'm ready to return. I mean it."

K: "Then, welcome back." I nodded, leaned over, and hugged HIM.

Sacquet: "Oui? So.. who will command NEIGHTO?" He smirked.

K: "Oh?" I tilted my head to him. "Coming with?"

Sacquet: "I so... desperately.. need a vacation, K." He smirked back, in that special Prench egotistical way.

K: "Well, then. I'd suggest either Admiral Tortellini or Brigadier Fosberry." I nodded.

Sacquet: "Tortellini." He nodded back to me.

K: "Make sure you tell Gio, then." I grinned.

Sacquet: "Oui!" He nodded, and trotted off.

With that settled, I went looking for trouble. I knew my talent would best be felt in the field with the lead elements. I was a good strategist, apparently, but I always felt like I had a better handle on the situation while swapping fire with the enemy.

But, I needed a team.

I found Trixie and Jack.

K: "Hello, you two." I paced up, holding my hand out to Jack. "We cool?"

Jack Pot: "We are." He shook hoof-and-hand with me.

Trixie: "K.." She looked down, then up, and grinned HAUGHTILY. "Father has spent the last few days cramming me with knowledge." She flicked her tail. "I may not be on the same level as our beloved purple menace.." She grinned wistfully, tilting her head to the side. "..but.." She looked at me with determination. "..I am ready."

Jack Pot: "She needs more thorough training, General K-"

K: "Just K." I nodded. "We should be friends, Jack."

Jack Pot: "K." He nodded, smiling. "Yeah, she needs a lot of training. The instruction part, I can boil down to a few weeks, but she'll need as much practice as she can get once I give her all the tools. I did what I can with the time that I had. I know.. we're needed."

K: "Alright. I need to know about your actual mission. Who put you up to being a War Mage? All that." I gestured.

Jack Pot: "I'm.. we're called the Guardians of Friendship. Grander a title than what we really are - a loose collection of ponies from all the pony races, experts in our field, we're supposed to handle problems that the Palace can't, won't, or doesn't see. Quietly. Just before the war, Tirek.. he must've known about us. There were.. like.. a dozen of us, I figure. It's not like we had regular group meetings. I know he killed the other two in my Cell, but left me alone. Probably to curry favor with my daughter, if needed." He shrugged widely. "I'm reasonably certain that he identified my blood line and.." He shook his head. "I don't want to sound so egotistical, but we descended from one named Gallart Bonebeard.."

Rainbow Dash skidded to a stop six feet above me, and zoomed down.

Rainbow Dash: "THAT name again!" She pointed at Jack. "Dude, do you have ANY idea how many times that name's come up!?"

Jack Pot: "I-I.." He shrugged. "..no."

Rainbow Dash: "YOU... you need to come with me. We need to talk to Twilight." She looked between me and Trixie. "Dusk's lookin' for you - him and Rarity are over by the supply dump. Er, OUR supply dump." She practically DRAGGED Jack Pot with her as she departed.

I stared at them as they left.

K: "So. Thee, me, and thine?" I smirked.

Trixie: "Yes." She gave a VERY egotistical cruel smirk. "The Grrrreat and powerful Trixie..! Wishes to go find trouble." She patted my hip with her hoof. "Come, we need armament."

She STRUTTED over to the supply dump. STRUTTED.

Trixie was back. No longer stuffed into a shell of her own self pity, she was reassured. She mended bridges with her father, she fell in love, and she was accepted by The Herd. And now? She TRULY knew where her strengths lie.

And she was about to return to Tirek tenfold the pain he caused her other self.

We got over to the Supply Dump, and for some reason...

K: "Brindle? What're you doing with that uniform and clipboard?" I tilted my head - he was wearing an Equestrian Army uniform with a Warrant Officer's tab.

Brindle Spindle: "...my part?" He shrugged, smiling. "I can't very well send my son and daughters-in-law out, without making sure they're properly supplied. Besides! Running a supply dump isn't THAT far off from keeping spreadsheets of fabric supplies." He nodded, and patted my shoulder. "Thank you, though, for showing me that I can help, still."

K: "My.. pleasure?" I tilted my head, chuckling. "Speaking of thine kinfolk..?" I gestured around.

Brindle Spindle: "Over there." He pointed with the pencil in his mouth.

Trixie: "Thanks, New Dad." She gave him a very familial hug and cheek kiss. "I can't WAIT for you and my Dad-Dad to get better acquainted." She strutted away, and over to Dusk and Rarity.

K: "She's baa-aack." I said almost monotone.

Brindle Spindle: "I can see that." He snickered. "I love it. It should make things.. interesting." And he nodded. "Oh, we have enough food for 21 days for all our current forces - that is, Equestria has 2 Combat Brigades on the ground here, and almost another besides between displaced Naval crew and miscellanious personnel, that we're responsible for. The last Marine Brigade from 1st Mar Div will be here in five days, along with another 47 days of rations, and 24 days of fire. We currently have 19 days of fire for our current forces." He nodded. "Plenty of party favors to go around. No deficiencies that I can see - we could use more Petrol, but that's being brought with the Marines, along with their mechanized vehicles. We don't have many that we're directly responsible for."

K: "Got it." I nodded. "Every Marine has weapons?"

Brindle Spindle: "Yessir." He nodded with a grin. "We recovered all the small arms from the sunken vessels. We also have two companies of blue jackets that are pulling security, now. Crew from the sunken vessels that weren't reassigned elsewhere." A small shrug. "Exactly 70 weapons were too damaged to repair, so, we cannibalized them for parts. With that, we were able to repair 112 others."

K: "Dang, you're GOOD at this!" I nodded, with a proud grin, as Dusk and Rarity came over, with full equipment.

Brindle Spindle: "It's my job." He nodded proudly. "Son? Going looking for trouble?"

Dusk Seeker: "Yeah, Dad." He smiled a bit. "You be CAREFUL, now. I didn't make up with you, only for you to get hurt."

Brindle Spindle: "I'll be alright." He hugged Dusk. "Now, go on. K needs us - everyone needs us - to do our part." He nodded to Rarity. "That goes for you, too, young lady."

Rarity: "Of COURSE, Darling." She hugged her father-in-law. "K?" She smirked at me. "Shall we off?"

K: "We shall." I nodded. "I've been advised that the Germanes and Vulpes are going to try an offensive to retake lost territory, almost right in the center. I want to see what we can do."

Dusk: "Not going anywhere without this." He handed me a Grant/Gavin, and the correct clip-on pouches, full of ammo. "We have two Snipers, a Machine Gunner, and a Grenadier. I think we're well rounded."

K: "Should be." I nodded, accepting the gear, and getting it all on. I was only armed with my Dager and Bowie Knife, otherwise. "Alright. Let's get going."

Now to start turning the enemy back, and evict them from Vulpesylvania. I was interested in how long this would take - a similar conflict on Earth lasted a few months, though. Maybe we could shave some time off that.

But, I had all the Friends here that I needed to make this work. And as I always say..

...Friendship is Magic.
