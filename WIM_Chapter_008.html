DATE: 6 Primaus, 1002 C.S.

It had been about a month since Derpy's Rangers saved the Cutie Mark Crusaders. Lyra and Bon-Bon were the next to join the unit, and proved themselves very capable at the concept of Ranging. Lyra, especially, took a liking to me. While we were training, though, the fallout of all of these tragedies started to hit home. We were out on the Rifle Range when everything started to go hooves up.

Derpy: "Uh, K? Can I have a word with you?" She tugged my sleeve, in concern.

K: "Sure, Derpy. Any news on Octavia?" I got up from where I was seated.

Derpy: "No, and it's not about that.. well, kinda, it is.." She shrugged her wings.

K: "Go on." I nodded.

Derpy: *Sharp breath* "Berry's drunk." She said, seriously.

K: "On the rifle range?!" I was stunned, and dropped my book.

Derpy: "Yeah.." She sighed in defeat.

K: "BERRY PUNCH! FRONT AND CENTER!" I called out, firmly, as I marched over.

Berry Punch: *Slight slurring* "Yessir.." She trundled over, with effort.

K: "Are you drunk?" I looked her in the eyes.

Berry Punch: "NO! I'm not.. not drunk." She sniffled a little.

K: *Sternly* "Right. Walk this straight line. COLD RANGE! EVERYONE TAKE TWO STEPS BACK!" I indicated the Ready Line on the range as the Rangers stepped back from it. "Walk it!" I commanded.

Berry Punch made a valiant effort to stay stable, but about halfway up the line, started faltering. No one said a word. Then, she toppled over, and started crying. Hard.

K: "You're DRUNK, and you came to RIFLE PRACTICE?! YOU KNOW MY RULE ABOUT FIREARMS AND ALCOHOL! THEY DO NOT MIX! THIS IS HOW ACCIDE-"

Berry Punch: "SHUT UP!" She cut me off!

K: "Did you just tell me to shut up?" I stomped over to her, like a Drill Instructor. "DID YOU JUST TELL ME TO SHUT UP AFTER YOU ENDANGERED THE LIVES OF YOUR FELLOW RANGERS!?"

Berry Punch: "YES! I DID! SHUT UP! SHUT UP AND LEAVE ME ALONE!" She galloped off, clumsily.

K: "Note to self - tough DI love does not work with ponies." I.. yeah, that was a huge revelation for me, really.

Derpy: "Don't be so hard on yourself.." She patted my thigh.

Lyra: "Aye, I'd'ahve done th' same thing." Yes, Lyra had an inexplicable Irish (Ironish in this world) accent.

Bon: "What's with her, anyway?" She looked at where Berry had run.

Derpy: "Octavia was her friend, too. Berry Punch was basically her orchestra's roadie.. and it's because of Octavia that she got that job." She shrugged.

Vinyl Scratch made a small noise, and sniffled, a tear escaping her eye. She still wasn't totally right in the head, but she made the effort. She knew ponies were counting on her.

Lyra: "Wahnt me ta go after her, K?" She asked in a reassuring voice.

K: "No, I'll.. Sergeant Derpy?" I looked over to her.

Derpy: "YES, sir!" She proudly snapped to attention.

K: *Sigh* *Softy* "Talk to her. She's your Ranger. Your friend. Right now she probably thinks I'm just a mean old human." I shrugged. "I'm going to the Cafe.. Corporal Cheerilee, take over, please."

Cheerilee: "You got it!" She nodded firmly.

Off to the Cafe I went. I was upset. Octavia's injury was the first time a Pony under my command had been hurt so badly. The Skirmish at Lonehoof Ridge was a lucky break - Twilight's gang got off with minor injuries. So, I walked in and took a seat. I was wearing my new "uniform" that Rarity had made for me. She was being so supportive of all this, Celestia personally paid her for her Scope design, and I was paying her from the Defense Funds to invent a proper uniform for everyone - I gave Derpy special permission to design her own uniform or her Rangers, though.

Doctor Whooves (10th): "Is this seat taken?" He asked, nodding to the chair next to me.

Yeah, the cafe is completely empty except us.

K: "Not at all, Doc. Have a seat." I gestured.

Dr. Whooves: "So.." He shrugged.

K: "Before you start psychoanalyzing me, do you actually have a Sonic Screwdriver?" I gave him a small smirk.

Dr. Whooves: "Oh, not any more.." He kinda cocked a brow, with a small smirk.

K: "So, you ARE-"

Dr. Whooves: "Don't finish that sentence. And no, I can't get you out of here." He shook his head.

K: "Alright. So, I'm not the only one that feels a little out of place." I nodded to him.

Dr. Whooves: "Eh.. you could say that." He smiled a bit.

K: "You were going to ask me about what happened, weren't you?" I looked at the cafe doors a moment.

Dr. Whooves: "Actually, yes. Nopony has ever been.. well, shot, before. Not like that. And not in a very long time." He sagely nodded.

Rose came over. She gave me a big smile.

Rose: "What'll you two gentlemen have?"

K: "Tea and biscuits. For two." I gave her a grin, and Dr. Whooves a small cocky brow raise.

Dr. Whooves: "Mm. Sounds lovely, actually." He gave me a warm smile.

He wasn't the Time Lord any longer - if he ever actually was, or if he only was for here, or whatever - but he was a mature, intelligent person. And I suspected he knew and understood far more than anyone else here. Even me. Rose made note of or order, and toddled off.

K: "I won't ask anything about 'that' but, I do want to know, are you singling me out for a reason?" I slid in closer to him, so we could talk more freely at lower tones.

Dr. Whooves: "Call it.. a familiar feeling. That and you look like you could use some intelligent, worldly conversation." He nodded a bit.

Just don't ask him any questions if he references something he shouldn't know if he lived his entire life - and only one life - here.

K: "I could. I mean, the girls are awesome and all-"

Dr. Whooves: "They sure are." He interjected, the statement meaning more than the words.

K: "-but, I need some perspective. Am I going too far with the training?" I gestured with one hand.

Dr. Whooves: "Being.. alert to danger.. is a wise stance to take. I don't blame you for doing what you're doing. If you're right and you really are causing some kind of effect on this world, taking steps to minimize the damage is a prudent action." He nodded sagely.

K: "I guess it is.." I trailed off.

Dr. Whooves: "..but you doubt if you're doing the right thing." He course-corrected me.

K: "Yeah, I am. Octavia's still in critical condition.."

Dr. Whooves: "..and if you'd never done training, the Griffons might not have attacked. Or if you'd been alone.." He said, presupposing possibilities.

K: "..would the kids have survived?" I led the thought line to the end.

Dr. Whooves: "Probably not. You're right - Derpy's Rangers saved the day. If you had been alone, I don't give the children good odds of survival." He shrugged.

K: "Still.."

Rose arrived with the tea. Doctor Whooves immediately took the pot and poured my tea for me, giving me a small smile.

K: "..you're playing Mother." The person serving Tea in an English tea ceremony is called Mother.

I knew for a damned fact that Equestria didn't have such formalities.

Dr. Whooves: "Ah-ah-ah, remember, no asking." He smiled fully.

K: *Small chortle* "Of course. Plain, please." I gestured.

Dr. Whooves: "Don't be too hard on yourself. No one can say for sure what the future holds.." He would know about that. "..but, for the present, enjoy what you have. The best that you can do is -plan- for tomorrow and be ready."

K: "Sounds about.."

Dr. Whooves: "..what you'd say to someone in this same situation." A knowing grin.

K: *Chuckle* "Doc, you're one strange man. I like you." I nodded with a smile.

Dr. Whooves: "Figured you would.."

He took a bite of biscuit. Just.. his whole feel about him, if I didn't look right at him, I would swear that he was human. And it felt fantastic. Did Doctor Who really have this effect on people? I'd never watched the series, though I was aware of it. He was a bit of a problem-solver himself. Even if he wasn't.. had at one time -not- been a human universe's 10th Doctor.. he was a wise and experienced man - Pony? - beyond his appearances. I had a feeling we'd be getting to know each other a bit more. In as much as he may be permitted. We finished our snack in knowing silence - not that much needed to be said. We seemed to connect, and know what each other was thinking, to the point where a mere look, spoke volumes. I'd found a genuine friend here. Then, Derpy came in, looking rather saddened.

K: "Doc? I think you've got another patient.." I nodded to her "..she looks like she could use a little of your advice."

Dr. Whooves: "Y-yes.." He'd been staring at her.. STARE-STARE-STARE.. it was cute.

He got up and went over to her as I deposited the bits for the meal on Rose's bartop. As I exited, I heard him speaking to Derpy..

Dr. Whooves: "Derpy, my dear.. you look like you could use a doctor." And with a warm, romantic tone of voice. Oh, dear.. he fell for her.

I went back to the farm. Applejack was home and we would be discussing our wedding. I -still- felt uneasy about this. A serious relationship is one thing, but going all the way to marriage? I didn't know if the world was ready for us. I was ready for her, and I know she was ready for me, but together? I got in, just in time to catch Applebloom digging in the cookie jar.

K: "GOTCHA!" I got up behind her, and tickled her sides.

Applebloom: *WHEEEEEEEE!* *Laughter* "AWWW! Ya cawt me!" She pouted.

K: "No cookies until after dinner, now go wash up." I set her down and nodded.

Applebloom: "Awright.." She gave me a peck on the cheek.

Of all the ponies in Ponyville, the Cutie Mark Crusaders had welcomed and adapted to me the easiest. Applebloom slipped up one day and called me Dad. I about cried. Applejack came in the room, setting her hat on the hat rack in the kitchen.

AJ: "How was trainin' ta'day, Honeybun?" She walked over, and leaned her left hooves over her rights.

K: "Bad. Berry Punch had a mental break down and came to practice drunk. Back on Earth, she would have gotten in a lot of trouble for that. Lyra and Bon-Bon are shaping up, though." I shook my head.

AJ: "Well, 'least that's goin' well." She gave me this 'come here' look.

How could I resist?

K: "Hm.. and what's on YOUR mind?" I asked, padding over.

AJ: "Oh, nuffin'.. jes' a lil' somethin' to take yer mind off'n yer troubles." She said warmly.. drippingly..

Her mouth bit carefully over my belt buckle, and I was being dragged out to the barn. I wasn't in a position to object. With expert mouth work, she had my belt off, the barn door closed and the latch thrown, and was unzipping my pants. She pushed me up against one of the beams in the barn, grinning up at me in a lusty, crazy way.

K: "Okay, and is this the Equestrian way to de-stress?" I gave her a goofy grin.

AJ: *Lusty giggle* "Sure, let's call it that, Shug.."

She freed the beast, and it glided between her lips, into her warm, slick mouth. I groaned. I only ever groaned when I was getting a blowjob.. normal sex, I rarely made noise. She was being slow, gentle, and tender in her ministrations of my manhood, slicking it up, letting her tongue wash over it.. those lips of hers suckle on it.. I moaned, as my head lolled back and hit the beam. She didn't wait long before sliding it out, and turning around. She didn't even lower herself down, she just slid her ass back into me, and my shaft found its mark in her delicious muff. Groaning herself, her vaginal walls contracted and started milking me while she moved her hips back and forth into me.

It was Magic, alright.

I leaned a bit forwards - rather paralyzed by the pleasure of it all - and gently grasped her mane. It tugged every time she pulled forwards. In between her ever-loudening moans, she managed to spit out 'pull harder' - which I did. I pulled back hard, as though her mane were reins. She yelped and asked for more. So, on every outbound thrust, I pulled her back into me. Back, and forth, our bodies making the lewdest noises - the wet slurching, slapping, and gooey sounds, the groans from my special somepony (and yes, I was STILL rather shocked at myself for thinking of this term), the heavy panting.. and the inevitable loud moan of release. I was de-stressed alright.. I was damn near out cold. I barely had the energy to pull over my work chair and plop down in it. Panting a little, and grinning at Applejack while she lowered herself down on the cool floor, and rested. She was all sweaty.. that meant I had the pleasure of giving her a hose-down.. and a massage.

*BAM*

K: "THAT WAS A GUNSHOT!"

I rocketed out of my chair, pants on, pulling my PA-63 from my holster. I ran outside, and there was Derpy and her Rangers - minus Berry Punch - rallied at the edge of the orchard. I ran over to them.

K: "Derpy! Report!" I called out, trying to get my shirt halfway buttoned.

Derpy: "Sir! Someone in a cloak attacked Rose at the cafe and made off with all her cash!" She came running up, fully armed.

K: "WHAT!?" I was shocked.

Derpy: "We were nearby, and we happened to see what happened, so, we responded.. did we do good?" She looked back at her Rangers.

K: "You did fine - who fired?" I nodded to them.

Lyra: "Ah did!" She affirmed.

Applejack came running up, with her Custer revolver holstered at her hip.

AJ: "Ah could hear you from the barn.." She caught Lyra examining me. "Hey there, sugarcube, no puttin' the eye on my stallion here!" She put an affirmative hoof on my side.

K: *Ahem* "Did you hit the suspect?" I corrected.

Lyra: "Ah dunno.. I might'ahve.." She looked at Applejack's stern face and blushed. "..but it vanished innae th' orchard."

K: "Derpy, up top. Scout it. Rangers, split up. Applejack, get Mac, and get Applebloom and Granny into the barn." I directed.

Derpy: "Right!" She flew up, and started examining the orchard from above.

Lyra: "Should we partner up? F-for safety." She was STILL looking at me.

AJ: *COUGH* "I got it, Honeybun." Off she galloped.

K: "Yes - and I want you partnered with Bon-Bon. Take the west. Cheerilee, Sweetheart, check the east side. And Vy, you're with me." I nodded.

Vinyl Scratch: *Scratchy throat* "Right."

Vinyl and I paced straight for the out buildings. She was still upset. She'd been crying recently, I could tell.

K: *Sigh* "Any news on Octavia?" I knew that's what her crying had been about.

Vinyl Scratch: "She's going to make it.. but.." She trailed off.

K: "But?"

Vinyl Scratch: "She's going to take a long time to recover. They're bringing her home tomorrow. Can.. can I get leave from the Rangers to take care of her?" She whimpered a little.

K: "Not a problem. I know you two are close-"

Vinyl Scratch: *Sob* "I LOVE HER!" She cut me off.

K: "-Oh."

Vinyl Scratch: "She's like a sister to me! And.. and she almost died before I could tell her how much she really means to me!" She about started sobbing, but held it together.

K: "OH!" Darn my lack of innocence some times. I thought she meant.. well.. yeah. "Head in the game, Vy."

Vinyl Scratch: *Sniff* "Yes, sir." She nodded.

As we approached the outbuildings, I saw the cloaked figure messing with something, partially obstructed by Mac's plow. I motioned for Vy to flank left and get a clear shooting position. I moved up, low crouch, PA-63 ready. Once I was good and close, I announced myself.

K: "YOU THERE! FREEZE! PUT YOUR HOOVES, HANDS, AND-OR CLAWS IN THE AIR, NOW!" I had my PA-63 aimed at its face, about six meters away.

The cloaked figure froze alright, but didn't raise their limbs. The head of the cloak cast enough of a shadow that I couldn't tell what species I was looking at. It looked at Vy, then to me.

K: "HANDS UP!" I repeated. "YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!"

The figure levitated off the ground, and in a sudden burst, a big ball of purple light exploded, dazing my vision. Vinyl had her goggles down, so it didn't affect her, and she fired twice at the figure. One round passed harmlessly through its cloak, and the other struck its "arm." It turned to her, and pushed her over with a purple wave of energy, before rocketing off into the sky. Derpy was right there, firing her Sherman at the cloaked figure, but it was too quick for her. Soon, it was gone, and Derpy declined to pursue without backup - a wise move. She landed next to me after circling around.

K: "Did you get a look at the.. whatever it was?" I looked to Derpy.

Derpy: "Nope, sorry." She shook her head.

K: "Well, it can't be helped. Let's pack it in." I said with a sigh.

Derpy: "Aww.. I failed." She frowned.

I patted her neck, reassuringly.

K: "Not every mission is a success - it's said that the way we deal with failure, and what we learn from it, is how we gauge our capability to grow." I pointed out to her.

Derpy: "Still, this is horrible!" *Hmpf* "Now I gotta train extra hard." She said with determination and grit.

K: "That's the attitude." I gave her another pat on the head. She smiled.

Derpy: "RANGERS! FORM UP! We're outta here." She instructed.

Derpy's Rangers left the farm, as Applejack came up and examined what the robed figure was tinkering with. It looked like it was trying to take apart some of the farm machinery, for some reason. Three different sized cogwheels were missing from one if the pieces of equipment.

AJ: "I dun git it, Honeybun. What'd they want with cog wheels?" She seemed annoyed.

K: "No idea. Anyway, it's dinner time. We'll.. have to shower afterwards." I shrugged.

AJ: *Lustily* "Sounds good to THIS mare.." She nuzzled my hand.

The next day, Princess Luna's carriage arrived, carrying Octavia. Luna herself was actually flying next to it. Steelhoof was with Luna's Guards, leading the way. They moved along the road carefully, but not with a sense of sadness or grieving. I came up to the carriage with Vinyl Scratch, and lo' and beholds, there was Octavia, sitting up. She looked.. thin.

K: "Report, Ranger." I said, softer than I probably should have. I promised myself I wouldn't cry, but this was hard.

Octavia: *Mmm* "Ranger Octavia, reporting for duty." She said, weakly.

Her eyelids were heavy with medicine. Her chest area had a huge bandage covering it, fresh and white. There was an IV bag hanging from one of the hooks on the inside of the carriage - saline solution, nothing big. Nurse Sweetheart was in the carriage with her. She looked at me, worried, and got out of the carriage, after whispering something to Octavia.

K: "Yeah, Sweetheart?" I asked, in low tones.

Nurse Sweetheart: "I.." She looked at Vy, and nodded to her. Vy climbed in the carriage. "It's bad. She's going to be in bed for weeks, and even after that.."

K: "..is she going to be strong enough to play music again?" I was more worried about that.

Nurse Sweetheart: "Yes.. given time. But.." She trailed off.

K: "..she'll never be healthy enough for active duty, will she?" I shrugged.

Nurse Sweetheart: "She lost half of her liver, and her diaphragm was seriously damaged. The liver.. that'll grow back, with time. But.. she might not ever be able to keep up with strenuous physical activity again - she might not be able to breathe well enough to keep up." She whined a bit.

K: *Siiiighhh* "I understand. How does she feel about it?"

Nurse Sweetheart: "We.. I haven't told her how bad it really is.." She looked down.

K: "Tell her. She deserves to know. She's a hero." I nodded.

The Cutie Mark Crusaders ran up and all piled into the carriage, hugging on Octavia and telling her how sorry they were for getting into trouble. The poor fillies.. they blamed themselves. I moved over to Princess Luna..

K: "Your Highness." I put a hand on her shoulder.

Luna: "K." Again, she rested her foreleg on my shoulder. I swear she's still flirting with me. "Anything to report?"

K: "Nothing major - we had an unknown intruder attempt to rob the cafe, but Derpy's Rangers pursued them into Sweet Apple Acres' orchards. We pursued the unknown hostile to one of the outbuildings, and attempted to detain them. They.. used magic, flew, attacked us non-lethally, and managed to break contact. They were about as tall as a pony, and seemed to move on two legs. Small legs. It wasn't a Raptorian, it was something else. They dropped the Bits in the west field, which we recovered later, but they stole three cogwheels from a piece of farm machinery. Nothing important - but I've learned that it's the small stuff that adds up to bigger problems."

Luna: "I see. Thank you." She nodded and led the carriage to Octavia and Vinyl's apartment.

Luna stood there as they took her out on a stretcher, and carried her to her and Vinyl's room. I watched from a distance. I was mad at myself - Octavia really wanted to be a part of the Rangers, but now, she may never be fit for duty ever again. Berry Punch resigned on me - Derpy told me that morning. She couldn't handle the pressure. Not everyone can. Doctor Whooves told me he saw her taking a train to Baltimare, to stay with a cousin for a while. I didn't blame her. She was a good Ranger, but, she was one of those that couldn't deal with the fallout of being in a real war, with real blood. Derpy was devastated that she'd lost two Rangers, but Dr. Whooves asked her out on a date, and that seemed to cheer her up. As for me?

AJ: "HONEYBUN~!" She galloped into the square with a picnic basket.

I had other things to concern myself with.
