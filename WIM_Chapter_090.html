Part 1: Looking Glass

TIME: 11:33 MST
DATE: Friday, 12 March 2004
LOCATION: K's House, Canterlot, CO

I had everything I was going to bring back with me. Laptop, spare batteries, cell phones, walkie-talkies, all kinds of stuff. And most of my guns.

K: "Okay, Sunny." I shrugged. "Time to explain the real truth."

I led him up to the Mirror.. and bade him to look through.

On the other side, was himself. Prince Consort Sunshine Smiles. A pony.

K: "I'm not with the US Government. I'm sorry I misled you about that." I patted his shoulder. "You see him? Him and I shed blood together. We're fighting a war - a real war, not that shit in A-Stan and Iraq. He died, once. I managed to revive him. He's married to a Princess. And he and I are bros."

He turned to face me, but my eyes were watering.

K: "I'm.. I'm just glad.. no matter where we are, Sun, we're bros, no matter what." I opened my arms for a hug.

GOD DAMN is Human Sunshine STRONG! He popped my back!

Sunny: "I had a feeling something wasn't right.. but.. like.. I could trust you. So, I did." He was tearing up, too.

K: "Over there, they call me General K." I nodded a little. "I'm commander-in-chief of a whole military alliance like NATO. Tirek.. Tirek is our ultimate enemy. He's killed so many people.." I looked at Pinkie. "He's the reason she's here." And back to Sunny. "He's the reason Sunset was stuck here, and.. used.. like that."

Sunny: "Sounds like one heck of an adventure." He nodded. "I don't suppose I can go with?"

Pinkie: "Universe doesn't work like that, silly-billy." She slid up next to him, and smooched him. "You and me, though? We're real. Really real. And I love you." She caressed his cheek. "I didn't get you, over there, because fate got in the way. Here? You're my special cupcake."

Sunny: "So.. I suppose you have to go back, now." He was tearing up, too.

K: "I do." I shrugged. "Not that I want to. I mean, I do - I have a family over there. But.. I kinda grew a family over here, too, didn't I?"

Sunny: "Bros." He held his hand out.

K: "Bros." I shook it.

Sunny: "Will I see you again?" He asked.

K: "I can't promise." I shook my head. "You need to keep that Mirror, safe. If I lose, over there, Tirek is going to want your head. And Pinkie's. I mean.. at one point, I wanted you to shatter it."

Sunny: "I'll keep it somewhere safe." He nodded back.

K: "There's also a chance I'm going to die when I confront him. I nearly did, once, already. That, or, I go back to my actual real world, when this is all over." I gestured to the trailer. "This.. this isn't it. I have a wife, over there.. her name is J--. We've been together for over ten years. I miss her. I hope I do go back.. I don't know what's going to happen, but.. if I can come back and see you, I will."

Sunny: "Alright, bro. Well.." He hugged me again. "Good luck."

I was going to miss this place.

The bags went through, first. Then Sunset.. then me. We were both tackled to the ground, hugged, and cheered. I had returned. Alive, and victorious.

Applejack.. once everyone was done getting their hugs in..

Applejack: "Naw.. ever'one.. I know we's all excited t'get our friends back.. but.." She fixed me with a gaze. "I'm sure they're exhausted from their lil' adventure.." She paced right up to me. "..an' bein' as I'm the General's Wife.." She fluttered her eyes. "..I'm'a be seein' to their.. comfort."

Sunset: "Oh, I'm in trouble, now.." She whined a bit.

Rarity: "Darling, you would have been fine if you hadn't said anything." She sat up and filed her right hoof.

K: "I just want to say.. before I'm dragged off and forcibly relaxed.." I grabbed Sunshine and hugged him. "You and I are bros, no matter what universe we're in."

Sunshine: "Yeah.. hah.. I saw myself in the mirror." He raised his head. "Looks like I'm a soldier, no matter what, huh?"

K: "And a damn good one." I nodded to him.

Applejack smiled, warmly, though.. knowing I had a connection like that to a Stallion, the way she did with the girls. That kind of male bonding. If I was going to spend the rest of my life, here, she DID want me to have male friends the same way she had female ones.

Applejack: "Ah'm glad y'all're bros like that." She sighed a bit.. then bit into my belt and started dragging. "Let's go, you!" She eyed Sunset. "You, too!"

K: "See you guys later!" I chuckled a bit, as I was being pulled away.

Rarity: "Oh, not without me, Darling. Come along, Dusty, I'll do your hair once this is over." She patted her on the shoulder.

Dusty: "Hot damn!!" She trotted behind us.

Celestia: "Enjoy yourself, General! You're going to be QUITE busy tonight.." She shot me a 'Mommy Has Needs' look.

Goddamnit, I was in trouble...


TIME: 07:22 ERST
DATE: War Day 805/19 Sextus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Royal Palace, Canterlot, Equestria

I woke up the next day.. and realized that.. well, damnit, I'm only ONE MAN. I have entirely too much of the best pussy in Equus to sate all in one go. It didn't help that, after my fight with Tirek, my adventure in Colorado, and all the time in Navarre, I'd skirted death several times, and everyone.. everyone.. wanted "that closeness" they felt after getting some quality time with me.

Telling Celestia and Luna that Pinkie was not only just fine, but very happy as the Guardian of that world, made them both cry tears of joy. Moreso when I told them that, today, after they had all the necessary stuff bought, they wanted me to return briefly to bring her Spunky Pie, now that she was in a position to properly care for him.

I couldn't blame them for wanting that kind of intense emotion. This war, especially the last month, had been draining on everyone's emotions. War Exhaustion is a real thing. America experienced it in World War II, despite rosy depictions otherwise - my grandmother and her family, especially after rumors started coming back after D-Day about the insane casualty rates, could testify that more than a few of their neighbors and kin would have been very happy to see Roosevelt or Truman negotiate an end to the war in Europe that a lot of Americans didn't see as their business, anyway.

I just finished dressing. I had my Morgan on me, and I had an extra Canidan-made (commerical) Morgan to give to Sunny and Pinkie.. and Pinkie's old Knox Grenade Launcher with her carvings on it, and some other of her stuff.

Applejack: "You know ah'm gonna be right on th' other side, right?" She kissed me.

K: "I know. If you could come, I'd be very happy, but.." I shrugged.

Spunky: "Abhhoooo!!" He bounced in my arms.

K: "Yeah, come on, you little stinker." I kissed AJ again. "I'll be an hour. And if I'm not, the human weapons are right there.. send Sunset and Twilight to come get me." I shrugged.

Applejack: "Durn straight, I will!" She huffed, and hugged me one more time.

I stepped back through, Spunky in my arms, and a huge satchel over my shoulder.


TIME: 07:33 MST
DATE: Saturday, 13 March 2004
LOCATION: Sunny's House, Canterlot, CO

K: "Good morning!" I called out.

Spunky's human baby form was cute as heck.. and he suddenly discovered that he had FINGERS.. and TOES.. and his right foot went directly into his mouth.

Pinkie: "In here, K----!" She called from the back room.

I walked in, and was greeted with a Baby's Room. Holy HELL had she gone to the limit! New "evolving" crib that could be reconstructed into a toddler bed, a play area, loads of toys, books ranging from story books to picture books, a Speak-and-Spell, the works.

K: "Sunny!" I grinned. "Here." I handed HIM Spunky.

Sunny: "Whoa!" He took the baby in his arms. "Hey, there lil' guy!"

Spunky: ".....DADDY!" He finally said, clinging to Sunny for dear life.

K: "Uh, Pinkie, that's his first real word.." I blinked.

Pinkie: "Hm! Seems I picked the right sta-ahh-MAN!" She giggled. "Toys for adults?" She pointed to the satchel.

K: "Yup." I got it off my back and set it in the hall. "I got all the stuff from your old room - Mr. and Mrs. Cake had just heard about what happened when I got back to Canterlot, so, they hadn't had time to decide what to do with your stuff. Your Knox and all your old gear is in there. Just don't let the ATF catch you with that unlicensed ordnance projector." I smirked. "I included a few boxes of grenade shells, and several empty hulls so you can roll your own." I shrugged. "Sunny, pass the baby, I have something for you specifically."

He did so, and we stepped into his Man Cave. I was in uniform, too - field tunic and pants, pistol belt, but still. I looked like a General, now. I pulled my smaller messenger bag off of my shoulder, and opened it, taking out a pair of small cases.

K: "By the authority vested in me as Commander-in-Chief, General-Field Marshal of the Armed Forces of the Kingdom of Equestria and Supreme Allied Commander of the North Equus Independent Group of Herds Treaty Organization, I appoint you to the rank of Warrant Officer, Equestria Royal Army." I attached the shoulder boards to his flannel shirt, and saluted him.

He saluted back.. standing at attention.. tears coming down his cheeks.

Sunny: "I.." He was choked up.

K: "For voluntarily risking life and limb in the service of two nations, for bravery and gallantry above and beyond the call of any duty, on behalf of Their Royal Highness, The Princess Celestia of the Sun and Luna of the Moon, I award you the Distinguished Service Crown." I slipped the medal on his shirt. "You've earned it, Sunny Smiles." I saluted again.

He returned it. We hugged.

Sunny: "I.. this means more to me than.." He was wiping away manly tears. "I don't know what to say."

K: "I'm not done." I pulled out the laptop, opened it, and turned it on, then played a video file.

Prince Sunshine: "Hey, me! If you're seeing this, K managed to come back to you.. me.. us.. and get this to you. I want to explain why we have a connection with him..."

Part 2: Front to the Back

TIME: 11:22 IT
DATE: War Day 812/26 Sextus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: 24km from Pamplona, Navarre

I came buzzing in on a C-1 Buffalo with my General Staff. As we landed at the makeshift airfield, I could see that everyone was gathering around their camps, and preparing for what should be the last major ground engagement of the Navarese Civil War.

I was glad I could be back in time to lead my forces for our phase of the battle.

I disembarked the plane, and was greeted by the staff and friends that I'd left here, almost a month ago.

Forest Spirit: "K!" He hugged me immediately.

Sacquet: "MON AMI!" He tackled me to the ground.. and Spirit with me. "YOU LIVE!" He hugged, too.

K: "ACK!" I tapped both of them. "GENERAL.. NEEDS.. AIR!"

They got up, and I brushed myself off, as everyone else disembarked the plane.

Forest Spirit: "Twilight..?" He tilted his head at her. "..errr.. new manestyle?"

Twilight: "I'm half dragon, now, Forest." She shrugged her wings.

K: "She's also no longer the Element of Magic. Tirek killed her, briefly, and Tiamat revived her." I shrugged a bit.

Sacquet: "Mon dieu!" He gave her a hug. "Twilight, you are still our friend, forever. No matter what." He put a hoof on her shoulder.

Redheart: "No kidding." She hugged Twilight.

Twilight: "Thanks.. that means a lot.." She smiled, then hugged all three of them, one at a time.

K: "May I introduce Sunset Shimmer - our new Element of Magic." I gestured to her as she got off the plane.

Sunset was set up as a markspony, like Rarity, but she had a grenade launcher on her as well. The pistol version of the Gavin, the Cota. She wore standard Equestrian temperate camo, with a beret. She bore no rank, same as the girls. Her chest rig was set up to put her pouches and loops on the flanks. She carried her issued Morgan pistol in a rear leg holster, right side. Left foreleg had her combat knife - the Cold Steel OSS, actually.

Forest Spirit: "Welcome." He put a hoof on her shoulder.

Sunset: "I kinda feel like I'm coming in at the middle of the story, here." She shrugged.

Toola: "Like we told you - don't worry about it! How do you think I feel?" She giggled. "I mean.." She shrugged.

K: "What's the situation?" I asked, as the troop replacements that the forces here had requested, disembarked the plane behind me.

Forest Spirit: "We've concluded all the support operations before Pamplona. The Dukes are eager to take the city, and the troops we've absorbed from the other two cities will have finished essential training the day after tomorrow. The Anarchists are in control of the city - they retreated all the way here with their remaining force. Two trained regiments, three regiments of rabble. Colonel Espinoza wants to see you."

K: "Colonel?" I smirked. "Maria has done well for herself."

Forest Spirit: "Even money, she becomes Commander in Chief of the Navarese military after the war." He shrugged. "We located General Falco - he's just started marching this way from Barcelona, which he captured with his own forces. He'll be here in four days. Meaning, we have two days to capture Pamplona, if we want the Dukes to have a clean and unquestioned victory."

Sacquet: "A tight schedule, mon ami, but we can do it easily." He nodded. "The Navarese Forces have become quite skilled. Equal to the Equestrian troops, I should say."

K: "And the rest of the International Brigades?" I said, adjusting the Glock on my hip.

Forest Spirit: "They've gotten a lot of experience as well - not so much in combat shooting, but in deploying rapidly, taking and holding objectives while under threat, and learning what it means to be alert in a combat zone." He looked at the Glock. "..what's THAT sucker?" He grinned.

I moved to a clear area by a berm, and motioned folks over.

K: "I based the Morgan on the Colt 1911 pistol. Good gun, low capacity. This.. is the Glock 19. Probably the best all around handgun available in my world - perfect balance of size, durability, capacity, concealability, customizability, and so on. A true jack of all trades, and a master of a couple." I showed off the trigger. "I can't reproduce this trigger for ponies - the double trigger acts as a safety. In fact, the only safety. Observe!" I aimed at the berm, and lit off all 15 rounds in the magazine, plus the one in the chamber, much faster than one could with a Morgan, or even a Canidan High-Power, and I kept the weapon on target well enough to put all 16 within a pony torso-sized target, in about a three-and-a-half inch group.

Forest Spirit: "Now that's a heck of a sidearm." He nodded. "Going to make a version for us?"

K: "You know it - It'll be named the Degar." After Holmes Ely Degar, a combat commander in World War II that was legendary for being able to drive assault spearheads with amazing speed. "The Pony version will be adapted for a Pony-style trigger.. but I'll also be adding a few special accessories, like a sear disconnect, so it can be made fully automatic, and replaceable sights. We have chemists working to reverse engineer how to make Tritium night sights. You have to realize, Forest Spirit, Sacquet, guys.. when I left, I ended up going to a human world similar to my own, so, I grabbed as much information and technology that I could. In about 100 days, we're going to be taking another major technological leap. Portable comms and other devices that don't use fragile batteries, shrunk-down flashlights that every soldier can carry that don't fizzle out in anti-magic fields, a new rifle, the works.."

Sunset handed me my HK91A3. With the Hensoldt 4x scope, it was a good Light DMR.

K: "This is the Heckler & Koch (Ko-hhch) HK91A3. The military version is called the G3. The round it fires is slightly larger than the 7mm NEIGHTO, but the version I'll be making, will be chambered in 7mm. This, right here, is probably one of the best and most robust assault rifles manufactured in my world. This rifle will be called the Grant when it goes into production. Unlike the Bradley, this can have an even more compact collapseable stock, making it easier for ponies - and Ibex-" I noted that the Dukes had approached, with Colonel Espinoza. "-to handle." I nodded to them. "Once you join NEIGHTO, the technical data package to make this system will be provided."

I motioned for everyone to get back again, and I took a knee, then planted all 30 rounds on target like a laser.

K: "It'll be completely capable of being fielded as a Markspony Rifle, Assault Rifle, and a compact carbine for special operations - Rangers and Paratroopers. I'm making a new shotgun, also - I didn't bring that with me. The action is going to change from gas operation to inertia operation, making the weapon shoot cleaner and be easier to maintain. I want these weapons completely online before we take Tirek." I motioned for Havoc to come over, and reloaded. "Here, pal, take a shot."

He slid the stock down to account for his size, and got comfortable with it.. then he took a few shots, adjusted his aim a bit, and fired more. A beaming grin.

Havoc: "The human version's a bit long for me, but I can imagine a Wolf-sized verison is going to be a fantastic weapon." He handed it back.

K: "In addition, better powder, other minor upgrades all across our forces, you name it. Tirek, once again, handed me something I really needed - and in the process, he's made us stronger. Also, I killed the human version of him." I shrugged.

Sacquet: "How did you do that, mon ami?" He asked, examining the AR-180B.

Sunset: "He shoved that fucker into a woodchipper.." She growled, but cleared her throat, realizing she'd cussed, and ponies generally don't. "Sorry, but he kept me as a 'toy' for years, knocked me up, and made me abort it."

Sacquet: "SACRE DAMNE!" He spit on the ground.

Gaze: "Oi, ain't the werst of it, mate.. he was tryin' ta take over part of that human world, an' spread misery, t'strengthen his counterpart here, wi' dark energy." He shrugged. "Twilight an' I studied what were goin' on wi' that."

Forest Spirit: "Sounds like he deserved it." He snorted, angrily.

Chemical Lens: "He did." She paced up, with Wide Lens. "My dear husband and I are reporting for Gendarmes duty, K."

Wide Lens: "Thanks for saving me, everyone." He patted folks on the back, and hugged Sgt. O'Fang.

K: "Good. Good. You two, take command of the Gendarmes detachment here, and make sure you police all the camps. We have a lot of new Ibex, and they might wander off without thinking - and remember, no booze." I nodded to them.

Chemical Lens: "Of course." She nodded.

Twilight: "That's not the worst of it - her parents tricked us. They were part of a Unicorn Supremacist Cult that.. may be allied with Tirek somehow. My.. father.. was a part of it." She looked down, in shame.

K: "She's not kidding. Her parents sold her to Tirek. They apparently had a deal going where Tirek would make the Unicorns the turnkeys once he took over, and reduced the rest of you to slaves. They seemed to prefer the idea of being the big fish in a small pond, than having the freedom that Celestia offers. Anyway - we must conclude this civil war, first, before we address that. Mainly so the International Brigades can go back to their home lands and instruct their countryponies in how combat operations work, adjust field manuals, that sort of thing. This is our first major operation - we're all learning something new, here." I gestured out to the masses assembled.

Forest Spirit: "Mmm. We've gone over the battle plans with the Dukes, and we'd like your input, K." He motioned to the command area.

It was good to be back with my.. my family.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Conclusions

TIME: 11:41 IT
DATE: War Day 812/26 Sextus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: 24km from Pamplona, Navarre

I was examining the plans to take Pamplona. They looked solid. The Dukes had done the general work, Forest Spirit and Sacquet had refined the details. Navarre's army now had a section of 90mm heavy guns donated from Germaneigh, and had captured enough enemy tanks of Herdiet make to form a single Armored Company. The Armor would spearhead the assault from the east side of town, where things were more open, while Rangers supported the attack. Infantry would be close behind.

In the south, Recon and the remaining Hoof Cavalry would advance first, followed by Infantry. The Recon and Cavalry teams would be responsible for reaching the Royal Palace, and securing it. If they had the ponypower, they'd also take the Governmental Administration Buildings next to it. Infantry would sweep and clear the city by the numbers.

We expected a nearly two day campaign, we were running very close to the edge of time remaining to us before General Falco arrived. We absolutely could not allow him a PR victory - this had to go to The Dukes.

And for that, I had a plan.

K: "We demo the bridges.. here and here." I pointed to a set of large bridges that led from Zargoza to Pamplona. "Leave these bridges here, open. That'll take him on an eight hour detour, and those bridges are more narrow.. it'll cost him time to get through them. That should buy us some time. Close to 12 hours." I ran my finger along the path Falco would have to take.

Duke Condor: "A little.. backstabbish, si?" He tilted his head.

K: "Which is why the Neighponese are going to do it." I nodded. "Your hands will be clean. Daishiro, you can chalk it up to the Banzai Spirit - no retreat, once committed to battle." I smirked a bit. "Yes, it's dirty pool, but we need to buy every minute we can."

Duke Alfonso: "Si." He gestured to the map. "This is the best way, but.." He looked at me. "..as with my cousin, I agree this feels dirty."

K: "Sometimes, in war, you have to do very dirty things to win. Once in a while, to people that aren't quite your friends, but aren't ostensibly your enemies. It's unsavory, but war itself is unsavory." I shrugged.

Col. Espinoza: "I agree with K." She nodded. "It is for the best. Falco - as he said - could both ruin our nation in the long term, and prevent us from helping our friends in the short term."

K: "Daishiro?" I nodded to Emperor no Ken.

Emperor no Ken: "My troops wirl carry out de assignment." He nodded slowly.

K: "Alright, then. Everything's prepared. Start disseminating orders to your subordinate units. We march at dawn, day after tomorrow." I nodded, and headed off.

I'd be commanding the Equestrian Armed Forces present, which now also included an Air Force Security Company, in addition to the entire 1st Brigade and 2nd Ranger Regiment, and the 1st Airborne Battalion. My immediate subordinates were Senior Colonel Flint Ironstag, commanding 1st Brigade, and Webley temporarily commanding the 1st Airborne. Derpy commanded the 1st Ranger Regiment (organic to 1st Brigade), and Dex commanded the 2nd. The Air Force Security Company was commanded by Captain Cloudly Breeze.

Air Force Security Protection units were primarily infantry forces that were intended to guard airfields close to the front lines. Unlike United States Air Force Security Forces, they weren't police in any regard. They were trained to use anti-aircraft weapons in an emergency, but their primary duty was guarding aircraft and stores. They'd be set up to do just that - guarding the Prench Air Force airfield, and our own.

I instructed all my gathered officers about our phase of the plan.

K: "Our objective is to provide a wall to the east of the city. 1st Brigade, your six Infantry Regiments will deploy along this set of hills and broken terrain about 12 kilometers from here. Armored Cavalry in reserve, Artillery here with all the others.. Cosmic has command there. The reserve 7th Mechanized Infantry will deploy here, near the road. They have two companies of anti-tank guns, and carry spare Funstons. That road is the only real stable terrain the enemy can use to deploy tanks or other armored vehicles." I traced along our operation map.

Twilight: "Where will we be?" She asked, half expecting me to say 'with the Navarese troops.'

K: "At the Forward HQ, near the Artillery. I want our four Jeeps ready to go, and fully stocked." I looked to Havoc. "Your Rangers will be deployed directly on me, since there's no other Canidan forces here."

Sgt. O'Fang: "Oh, boy! I smells trouble, General!" He snickered.

K: "Yeah, and, maybe we just spend the whole time playing fetch, who knows?" I shrugged.

Norfy: "We DO have a statistically higher chance of encountering something unexpected. K." He chuckled a bit.

K: "If it's another Monster Tank, we have all the Artillery we need to wreck it. If it's mystical, we can handle it. If it's a concerted enemy attack, they simply don't have a large enough force to hit us in numbers that would matter. They have five Regiments left - we have seven expert Infantry, plus armor, and arty." I shook my head. "I'm hoping this goes well. After the last month, we've had our share of crap to deal with."

Teddy: "No kidding. At least the Rainbow Factory is shut down.." He patted my shoulder. "..Tirek can't mass-exterminate Sentients any more."

Gaze: "Aye." He gave a short sniff.

K: "Alright. Two days. And as soon as we get to the assigned area, I want fighting positions dug, machine gun entrenchments, pill boxes, the works. I want those troops acting like Tirek's whole army is going to attack us." I tapped the map. "Webley, you're in reserve with 1st Airborne. If something like that DOES happen, move your forces about 2km behind us.. here. Until then, stay here at the assembly area."

Webley: "You got it - and we wait for a breach, and act as a counter-attack force." She nodded.

K: "Combined Arms when you do." I indicated on the map. "If there's a breach of any kind, I want Airborne plugging that gap, then the routed infantry regrouping to reinforce."

Webley: "You'll have it." She nodded firmly.

K: "Alright, run your final drills, but let the troops rest tomorrow. If there's going to be a huge fight, I want them fresh as possible." I tapped the table. "Dismissed."

And went over to the girls. Twilight was talking with them.

Twilight: "..and don't forget, when we need The Elements, we need them immediately." She patted Sunset on the shoulder. "You can do this."

K: "Rallying the troops, Twilight?" I nodded to her.

Twilight: "Well.." She sighed, frustratedly. "..besides running a machine gun, there's not much else I -can- do, right now. When I was reborn as a half-dragon.. I lost all my Pony magic. I'm.. I'm trying to re-learn the basics." She whined. "I feel so useless! Like I cut off my horn!"

Applejack: "Aw, Twi, it ain't like that a'tall!" She gave her a hug. "Yew been with us since th' start. An' y'all'll be with us 'till the end."

Rarity: "Indeed, Darling." A short sniff. "Besides, that machine gun comes in quite handy."

Twilight: "Tha-anks.." She still sounded sad.

K: "You have new magic to explore, Twi. And you can teach what you DO know, to Rarity and Sunset, that they don't know, that they can handle. Right?" I put a hand on her shoulder. "That Dragon Magic might be something we end up desperately needing. You don't know. So, don't be so hard on yourself. WE need you, WE care about you."

Twilight: "Yeah." She perked up.

K: "We'll run through some drills before dinner. Sunset still needs to catch up to our level of skill." I patted her on the shoulder.

Rainbow Dash: "We'll make her awesome in no time!" She gave Sunset a one-arm hug.

Fluttershy: "Yes.. she's our friend, now. We're responsible for her." She nodded.

Toola: "Don't worry - I had to learn a lot of new stuff, too." She beamed a grin.

Applejack: "Y'all'll be caught up in no time." A cheek peck.

Rarity: "We believe in you, Darling." That was a serious tone.

Dusty: "Ehh.. I suppose I can teach you a few of my tricks." She smirked.

Sunset smiled warmly. After everything that happened to her, being accepted by "The Herd," made her genuinely happy. It made me happy, too.. after all, Friendship is Magic.

Part 4: Siege

TIME: 07:11 IT
DATE: War Day 814/28 Sextus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Approaching Battle Lines, Near Pamplona, Navarre


We were double-timing it. Most everyone had a ride, so, it wasn't so hard on the troops. We got to the ridges and broken terrain just 12km from Pamplona, and as soon as we arrived, we started taking fire.

K: "OUT! OUT! TANKS, ADVANCE!" I called, jumping from my Jeep, rifle in hand, with Sunset and Toola behind me, Applejack detaching the Jeep's Abrams, and following.

Twilight: "Fire coming from the hilltops!" She pointed. "Rarity! Sunset!" She organized the girls. "Toola, help AJ with hers. Fluttershy, Dash, get a sight bead on them! C'mon, Spike!"

Spike: "Right with ya, mom!" He had her spare belts and spare barrel.

I grabbed hold of the first M-4 Meade that passed by, and pulled myself up on top, grabbing the pintile machine gun. The tank's commander popped her head up, and gave me a nod.

K: "Max elevation! Give 'em a few shots of HE!" I said, directing the pintile Browning up there, and firing a few quick shots.

This being a Tank Machine Gun, the ammo belt was loaded 1:5 Tracers, so the gun could be used for spotting. Dash and Fluttershy were up and had marked the targets with green smoke. I put a few bursts on them, so the tank crew could see. The Meade stopped, travered the turret, and fired off two quick shots of 57mm HE. Not the most effective against infantry, but they made some big poofs, along with its two nearest companions, and the gun fire ceased.

K: "MY TEAM! ON ME! FIRST RECON! FIRECRACKER, COME ON!" I called out, jumping off.

Firecracker Burst: "FIRST RECON, YOU HEARD THE GENERAL! COME ON!" She took the lead of her Company, and rallied them forwards.

K: "FIFTH INFANTRY, FOLLOW ON!" I called out, as my team advanced.

Norfy: "Come on!" He called, paused, sighted in, and fired two times, then fell in right behind me.

Cosmic: "We didn't expect any resistance." He said, falling in behind Norfy.

Gaze: "I betch'er issa patrol lookin' out fer exactly this!" He snorted, hefting his Ridgway, and advancing with me.

We climbed the low hill - it was steep - and as we got to where the shell holes were, we took cover in them, as 1st Recon advanced up to meet us. The girls set up the two machine guns. We were just below the peak of the hill.

K: "Hold here. FIRECRACKER!" I called her over.. and motioned to the Lads to follow me.

I got to the very peak of the hill and noted Ibex bodies all over the place. One had been hit by the Browning I'd been firing. He was also carrying a copy of the Walker RPG. Interesting - same as Quirtbeck. The peak itself was smallish, about 10 meters across, and it dropped off VERY sharply on all sides. There was a lone tree, here, and a large rock that was no doubt the tip of what the dirt was fastened to. Total height was perhaps 50 meters from ground level.

Down off the edge, I could see some small farm fields, the road that led to Pamplona that we'd have to defend with anti-tank guns.. and three ADVANCING Herdiet tanks, backed by half a company of infantry.

Firecracker: "Guns aren't set up, yet." She said, getting up there with me.

K: "Get your company's snipers up here. RARITY! SUNSET!" I motioned. "Cosmic! Get on the horn, get the 7th Infantry up here! We need AT Guns! Toola, call the Tanks, tell them to take a defensive position around those low pillars and broken rocks! I need Funstons!"

Rarity: "Hmm.." She sighted through her scope. "I think they are an alert team, meant to chase off recon forces.. and the shooting caught their attention." She looked to me. "The tanks are standard Herdiet light tanks. Funstons should be enough. Mmm.. My Hathcock might even do the job." She smirked.

K: "Give it a shot. Sunset, get in here with the Recon Company marksponies, start picking off ALL the enemies as soon as you get a shot at them. Norfy, if those tanks aim their barrels this way, Ice Wall. Gaze, get those Funstons, and get those tanks." I pointed as I got into a kneeling position, and sighted on the enemy with that Hensoldt on the HK91.

It was a good thing I decided that, if I was going back here, I'd need proper precision ammo for this thing - 168gr (10.8g) Sierra MatchKings.

At this range the 4x Hensoldt scope did give me enough magnification to get a bead on the Ibex advancing at us. They were poorly organized, most of them, but the two leaders of the formation seemed to be squared away.

K: "Sunset. The sergeant." I indicated. "I got their officer. Ready?" I looked at the other Marksponies. "All ready?"

Sunset: "Yep." She nodded.

K: "On my go, then on your own time." I sighted in on the Officer.. right between the horns..

The crack of my unusal caliber rifle would reach them AFTER his head virtually exploded, spraying a subordinate with brain matter and bone. The sergeant was hit in the chest, right at the apex of the lungs, he coughed blood violently, and fell over.

The rabble panicked at that point, and started shooting in EVERY direction.

The Recon Company marksponies, drew beads on them, and snapped off shot after shot.. kill after kill. Rarity aimed at the engine blocks of the light tanks, and fired off her 11mm rifle.. obediently, one tank's engine started smoking after four hits. It dropped back, as the other two light tanks got in range of the Infantry teams on ground level, and before they could open fire, I could hear Gaze direct the anti-tank rocket teams. They were stitched up with three rockets each, and all exploded.. the final tank started trying to go into reverse with the damaged engine.

And it found itself entirely alone - its infantry support was dead, too.

It just.. stopped in the field.

After about a minute, the turret traversed all the way to the rear, the hatch opened, and a white flag came sticking out of it, and waved around a bit.

K: "Firecracker. You, me, Applejack, Norfy." I pointed. "You take the Surrender.. Captain." I nodded to her.

Firecracker: "Yes, General!" She nodded to me, and we made our way down the hill.

We approached the tank, weapons raised, and she called to them.

Firecracker: "We accept your offer of surrender! Exit the tank, legs in the air! You will be treated fairly!"

Tank Commader: "SI, SENORITA!"

They tossed out their handguns, and one SMG, and then got out, one at a time. Three Ibex, and a Herdiet Pony.

K: "Not what I expected.. but also exactly what I expected." I nodded to the Herdiet. "Tovarishch, govorite po-angliyski?"

Herdiet Captain: "Da. You vould be General K, da?" He nodded to me, moving just a bit ahead of the Ibex.

He WAS wearing a field uniform, from the Tank Corps, but bore the brigade badge of a staff officer, not a field officer.

K: "Yes." I nodded to him. "Do you know Major Kosygin, or Colonel Kenevelov?"

Capt. Kenevelov: "I should. De Colonel.. is my father." He coughed a bit, and lowered his head.

K: "Ah. Well, he's alive and well, Captain. He surrendered his unit unconditionally to Equestria's army and requested asylum, citing the risk that he'd be executed if he returned or was repatriated." I shrugged. "We granted his request."

Capt. Kenevelov: "Rumors vere true, 'den." He nodded a bit. "I ask de same. Being realated to a suspected traitor, has not been easy. It vould double my shame if I were returned to my nation of origin alive and uninjured."

K: "Request granted, Captain." I extended my hand.

We shook, and I indicated the Ibex could lower their arms.

Capt. Kenevelov: "You are as honorable as reputed. I must then warn you that.." He looked at Applejack, and Norfy, then Firecracker. "..there is a full regiment of volunteers from Herdiet Union, here. We originally aligned with the Marexists, but when they were defeated, we were not present.. and we negotiated alliance with Anarchists."

K: "That's not all, is it?" I could hear the fear in his voice. "There's an atomic device here, isn't there?!"

Capt. Kenevelov: "...da, Comrade General." He sunk to his haunches. "As I said, being son of suspected traitor has not been easy. We have orders to die rather than be captured. The bomb is our last one - we were trying to get it out of Navarre and back home, since your little attack on Moscow. But, we have not had the means until just recently. Then, you arrived. We were cut off, our allies were killed.. my commader has orders to detonate the device rather than risk its capture."

Norfy: "Holy Hay Bales..!" He was more angry than scared.

Applejack: "Ah.. man, ain't nothin' ever easy?!" She snorted.

K: "We need to alert the Dukes. AJ, get our team together - we're taking the front lines, and we're going in first. Get the MARCh, and get us a plane, we need to move fast."

Indeed. Nothing in this war has ever been easy.


TIME: 07:41 IT
LOCATION: Navarese Royal Army Advance, Entering Pamplona, Navarre

Sunset, Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Toola Roola, Dusty Dunes, Twilight Sparkle, Spike Sparkle, Norfy Loconsole, Lidless Gaze, Cosmic Plane, Teddy, Gorcat, Gilda, Katrina, Jade. And me.

The MARCh slammed down to the earth just to the side and barely the rear of the advanced elements of the Navarese Royal Army, as they were jumping off. These soldiers knew me, most of them. They knew that if I came here, something was seriously wrong. I could already hear the field grade officers call halt on the advance as we disengaged from the MARCh, and RAN for the Dukes' field headquarters.

We'd radioed ahead and informed Forest Spirit and Sacquet about what was going on. They were less than pleased. The Dukes were even more upset.

I entered the tent, and returned several salutes.

Blinda: "The information is accurate, then?" She said, just confirming things - my presence was plenty of confirmation.

K: "Yes. Captain Kenevelov says the device was taken to the National Cathedral, behind the Royal Palace." I pointed to it on the map. "Your Highnesses, we don't have a choice, now. My people need to go in first, and take the Palace - if we don't, you won't have a capital left to claim." I said, grimly.

Duke Alfonso: "D-Do whatever is necessary! The lives of our people are in your hands, K!" He nodded, with fear in his voice.

Duke Condor: "SI! Mariscal. Please." He shook his head. "Our glory is nothing, if our people die needlessly."

K: "Wise." I nodded, and turned to Forest Spirit. "Change of plans. 1st Airborne is going in by parachute, we're aiming for the north-center of town. Abort the southern attack, advance from the east only, and try to push the enemy force out of the city, towards the west. Give them a wide berth if they attempt a retreat. No air strikes against any Prime Movers, instruct the infantry teams not to shoot the trucks or anything like that. 1st Airborne and my team are going to try to hook around behind them and ambush them as they're trying to withdraw. They can't instantly detonate the device - that much we learned from the last two we handled. So, we're going to try and take them, and dismantle the device. I'd rather not improperly detonate it, but I will if I have to." I looked over the table. "Ember, I need ALL your Dragons - you have one organized Company. They're to take off immediately, circle around to the north of town, and come in with the Airborne troops and provide them cover as they land." I looked between everyone. "We have one chance. If we fail, the rest of the war isn't going to matter much - the nuclear genie will be fully unleashed, and everyone will want them. Including, and especially, Tirek."

Meaning, if the Herdiets detonated the device properly, and everyone publicly saw what these weapons could do, this war would devolve to a nuclear exchange soon enough, with Tirek and NEIGHTO simply launching atomic weapons at each other - and thanks to Bright Eyes, we had two Hydrogen Bombs of 15Mt yield to kick things off with.

That would unleash the Cataclysm that would reset the World.. pretty much on schedule, more or less.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Atomic Heart and Soul

TIME: 08:37 IT
DATE: War Day 814/28 Sextus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Skies over Pamplona, Navarre


All of the Airborne Infantry Companies were in the skies. The HQ Company, Engineer Company, Artillery Companies, and the Recon Company were dropping without their mechanized support. The 1st Airborne Armored Company wasn't dropping at all. We just didn't have the space in the town to try dropping large payloads. The 76mm guns, I figured, half of them would end up in places we couldn't get to them in time, and we'd lose most of the ammo, but anything was better than nothing at all.

I was at the door of the slightly overloaded C-1 Buffalo holding the Parachute Infantry Battalion HQ Company, my HQ team, Webley, and Coco.

K: "REMEMBER! We have to AMBUSH them and get the device AWAY from them! Don't shoot it, no matter what! Marksponies, we're going to be counting on you especially, here! We can't afford any mistakes - we do, we're all ash!" I said, making sure my static line was hooked.

Webley: "We can do this! JUMP TO FIGHT, JUMP TO DIE! AIRBORNE!"

Company: "AIRBORNE!!"

Crew Chief: "TEN SECONDS!" He called out, and wrenched the door open.

I counted ten manually, and jumped just as the go singal lamp lit up. My third combat jump, and this was into an urban area. One of the worst places to attempt this sort of thing, but we had no choice. We had to get ON TOP of them, before they could think about anything but running away - and we'd give them what looked like a perfect escape.

I felt my parachute jerk open, and grabbed the rigging carefully.. I was jumping with my rifle fixed to my pack on my back. I reached back there to make sure it was okay, and feeling the cold metal of that German Engineering, I refocused on trying to pick a spot to land that wasn't going to get me hung up on something.

I spotted a small plaza and tried to aim for it.. but the wind was fighting me. I ended up off course.. instead of dropping six blocks south and four blocks east of the Palace and National Cathedral, I was going to end up four south and two east. I looked back and saw that this was a parachute clusterfuck - everyone was going to end up all over the place.

I focused on the last 100 feet of the landing, and realized I was going to end up on a roof.. I braced my legs as best I could, and as I was about to land, got ready to roll, but a breeze snagged me, and I ended up skidding across the roof on my heels. Quickly, I pulled out the OSS Knife, and slashed my rigging, cutting one side of it, and collapsing the envelope. I cut the other side, and got free.

Detaching my chute, I got my rifle out, and crawled towards the edge of the roof, to see if I could get a look at things through my scope. Sure enough, I had a clear line of sight towards the Palace area. It was heavily entrenched - all Herdiet forces. I estimated three companies holding the line. Behind them, towards the National Cathedral, I saw the Herdiets trying to appropriate vehicles and carts by whatever means necessary. They were rigging up their tanks to be used as tractors.

I switched to my binoculars, and scanned the area by the Cathedral that I could see at my angle. The bomb wasn't visible, but the senior officers were out in the open, on the Cathedral's steps, under an awning.

I was fairly certain that only the Regiment Commander and perhaps their second would have any idea on how to activate the bomb.

Opalfire landed on the roof.. rather, she landed on the side of the building, and crawled up the edge, and behind me.

Opalfire: "I saw you fly way off course." She said, looking through her own binoculars. "Where's the bomb?"

K: "I'm not sure. Too many candidates, and we can't see the grand plaza between the rear of the Palace and the Cathedral." I lowered my binoculars. "Try and gather up my team.. something, anything. I need some ponies. I'm going to work my way north along this road, on the rooftops, until I'm paralell with the Cathedral. There's plenty of cover. Get me something to work with. Go!" I hushed her off, and she departed the same way she'd approached.

I got up to my knees, and started working my way to the next roof. All the buildings were right up next to each other, and had no separation, except when a road cut through them. I managed to cross three roofs, and get to the street. This street would run in front of the Palace... I waited for reinforcements.

What I got were some paratroopers from different units, and Sunset. Opalfire brought the ones that couldn't fly, up to the roof level, but out of sight of the Cathedral.

Sunset: "K." She slithered over to me. "Everything's a mess - the wind caused us all to get mixed up."

K: "Names, ranks, units." I pointed to the other five.

SSGT Gusty Leaf: "Staff Sergeant Gusty Leaf, 2nd Company, 2nd Platoon Leader." She was a green Unicorn mare, with a spiky dark green mane.

SGT Amethyst Star: "K!" She slid right up next to me. "Good to see you. I'm in 1st Company, 2nd Platoon." She was outfitted as a machine gunner.

K: "Amethyst." I pet her mane, and shrugged. "Long way from Ponyville."

MSgt Rainey Parasol: "Master Sergeant Rainey Parasol.." She was lemon colored, a Pegasus, with a pink poofy mane she had tied back in a ponytail. "You knew my sister, Pixie. 3rd Company, 2nd Platoon Leader."

K: "She was a brave Paratrooper." I cleared my throat.

CPL Comet Tail: "General K. Corporal Comet Tail - I lived in Ponyville, but I think we kept missing each other. Ah.. 3rd Company, 3rd Platoon Medic." Yellow unicorn stallion, dark blue mane, he had it shortened.

CPL Apple Tart: "Hey, Cuzin. Ah'm Apple Tart - AJ's mah relation through Granny Smith." She beamed a grin - a rust-colored coat with a light tan mane. "Corporal of 3rd Company, 3rd Platoon."

K: "Guessing you lived in Appleloosa?" I nodded to her.

CPL Tart: "Yes'sir." She grinned a bit.

SSGT Leaf: "Plan, General?" She looked back at the others.

K: "Get across the gap, stay on the roofs, look for that atomic weapon. The enemy command unit is right there." I nodded to the Cathedral. "They're trying to gather up transports. I think they're aiming to bug out."

Msgt Parasol: "Sounds about right." She shrugged her wings. "I'll grab Comet, he's lightest."

SGT Star: "I can blink across small gaps, I'm good." She nodded.

K: "I can jump the gap with a running start, but I'd rather not attract attention. Opalfire? Me first. Star, blink across and set up. Parasol, grab Comet and follow her." I climbed over to Opalfire, and let her pick me up.

Star blinked across and set up her machine gun behind a chimney. Opalfire set me down on the far side, and I slid up next to Amethyst.

K: "Sorry we didn't get better acquainted. I really haven't talked to you much since my party 4 years ago." I shrugged.

SGT Star: "It's okay." She shrugged a bit, keeping her eyes down her sights. "You had eyes for Applejack from the very beginning. I could see it." She gave a small smile. "I didn't want to try and pry into that."

K: "Really?" I snort-chuckled just a tad. "Comet." I nodded as he got into position, and had his Ridgway ready.

CPL Tail: "Sir." He nodded a bit.

The others got across, and I moved down the furthest, taking Sunset with me.

K: "We'll slowly slink across the roofs until we get a better angle on the courtyard." I nodded. "I know Amethyst, she's good. Comet, I.. I saw him in Ponyville." I shrugged. "I know he was in the Militia."

Sunset: "And Rainey?" She asked as we got to the far end of the roof.

K: "Her sister was incredibly brave. She died in Neighpon, killing the first Monster tank we ever saw." I shook my head slowly.

As we got to the far end of the first building roof, I peeked my head around the edge of a decorative fold in the roof, and sighted down the Hensoldt on my HK91. I still didn't have a good angle, given how the palace was shaped. I motioned for my ad-hoc team to follow.

We got down two more buildings before I got a good look at the courtyard. The atomic device was kind of the center piece of a large stack of crates, identified by the Herdiet symbol for atomic weapons - an atom, or, a dot representing a nucleus and six orbiting swirls. It was still packed in its crate, and locked with chains.

Perfect.

K: "Everyone get over here." I motioned.

Opalfire: "What's u-Oh." She saw it, squinting and letting her better vision tell the tale. "That's the bomb, isn't it?"

K: "Sure is." I grunted.

Sunset: "What do we do? There's only eight of us." She shrugged, but set up her Sniper Sherman.

K: "Opalfire, Rainey, gather up everyone and everything you can, and amass them down on the street behind us. You have fifteen minutes. Go!" I hissed at them.

They slid down the back side of the roof, and took flight.

I could hear the Navarese Royal Army starting to engage the enemy at the edge of town. The Herdiets will be sending out a scout team, soon, to evaluate the situation and judge how much time they have left, and if there's an escape route.

I was hoping to catch them completely off guard, and get that atomic device away from them before they even unboxed it. If I could get enough troops to just.. get in there.. and secure the weapon.. steal it..

Sunset: "They have guards on the Bomb, K." She nodded.

K: "I see them. Four. One on each corner." I slid my sights over to the senior officers, who were now more animated.

I watched a field grade officer march up hurriedly, and start talking to them. The discussion was brief, he saluted, and departed, grabbing one of the HQ guards, and moving towards the palace. He'd be the Scout Team commander.. I gave him about ten minutes to gather a team, twenty minutes to evaluate the battlefield conditions, and five to get back.

Not ten minutes later, I had Webley sliding up the side of the building, and getting close to me.

Webley: "Everyone's all mixed up, K. Only two AT guns landed where we can get to them, and we lost most of the ammo." She sighed. "What're we looking at."

K: "Nothing Funstons can't handle. We're going to hit the courtyard, and steal that bomb." I nodded. "Heist time." I smirked at her. "Webley? HEAT." I forced her to get reception..

..she paused a minute, her eyes went blank.. then she grinned the most evil grin I'd ever seen on her.

Webley: "You get to be DeNiro. I'll be Pitt." She patted me on the shoulder.

K: "What've we got back there?" I asked.

Webley: "A company and change, part of the Pathfinder company, and a Weapons Squad with Funstons." She nodded. "Four machine guns."

K: "Alright. Set the MG's up quietly to give us maximum coverage of that courtyard. You, me, Opalfire, and Sunset are going to rush them.."

Amethyst: "Actually, sir.." She rolled around to face us. "..I can blink you, me, and one other pony almost next to the crate."

K: "Webley." I nodded. "Sunset, stay here and cover us - once the shooting starts, your priority is the senior officers. Herdiet units don't function well without officers."

Sunset: "That.. that I can do." She nodded.

Opalfire: "When you three blink over and secure the crate, yell for me, and I'll come pick it up. I can carry something that size, no problem." She nodded.

K: "Alright, go get us ready." I nodded to Webley.

She moved off.. and I looked intensely at that crate. We had to make sure every bomb was accounted for, every gram of Uranium and Plutonium.. this monster can never be allowed to mature in this world.
