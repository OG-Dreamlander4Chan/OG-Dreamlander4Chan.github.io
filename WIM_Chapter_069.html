TIME: 09:22 ERDT
DATE: War Day 632/28 Lunarius, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Bridge of HMS Moonlight, 230 nmi from Fillydelphia Harbor

The Raptorian had told me about various minor sabotage attempts that were afoot with the fleet, but knew nothing else. The artillery guns were loaded without incident, along with my first armored vehicles.. the Tassingy Medium Tank. I named it for a French general. Probably the greatest French general of the modern age. It sported a 76mm gun, and was intended to be used as both a tank, and mobile artillery. By digging a trench at an angle, the tank could be backed up into it, and used as an artillery gun.

Sherman tanks had been.. adapted.. to that role in Earth's Korean Conflict. I did it on purpose from the outset, even dictating that the pain scheme include marks on the sides of the tank's chassis on how to dig for different ranges.

The tank itself resembled the Sherman, but a bit longer, and with an angular turret instead of a rounded one. Taking into account modern tank design, I basically created a 21st century-laid out 1944 Sherman Easy 8. It looked mean, too. It's follow-up, the Powell Heavy Tank, was due to enter production soon.

I decided to organize the tanks into proper armored formations for Medium and Heavy Tanks, with Light Tanks and Armored Fighting Vehicles in updated Armored Cavalry formations. Equestria and NEIGHTO were completing the transition from an Infantry-centric to a modern Mechanized force.

It only took us three years.

Zorch: "Commodore Sea wants to see you in her cabin, General." He nodded.

K: "Yup." I rose from my seat at the rear of the bridge, and followed him.

Zorch: "I still can't believe I'm wearing this uniform.." He trailed off - he was now in an Equestrian Royal Army uniform, with shoulder pauldrons for General's Staff, but no rank.

K: "You gave me reason to trust you." I gestured. "You already know what'll happen if this turns out to be a trick or something, so, I won't bother."

Zorch: "I promise. I'll do GOOD this time." He rubbed his hands on his pants.

K: "The blood never comes off. You just learn to live with it." I shrugged, knowing why.

We got to Sargasso's cabin, and I entered with Zorch. Dex, Applejack, and Havoc were here.

K: "So, the plan when we get to Fusan is simple - the foreign ships we meet up with, will help provide gunfire support along the line as much as possible. The reinforcements from each nation will land at the Port of Fusan, and start taking positions as possible. Meanwhile, the 2nd Marines and a detachment of ships is going to reproduce exactly what my Earth did - an end run around the side of the main enemy force. Cowrea and my Korea are both narrow-ish peninsulae, meaning if we can land our Marine and Armored force here, near Jemulpo, and cut across the peninsula, going east, we can cut off the enemy force." I shrugged. "And after that, it's a matter of mop up. I know the pitfalls my military fell into along the way - I won't repeat those mistakes."

Sargasso: "I think we're good, then." She shrugged. "Who has command of the 3rd Marines?"

K: "Blinda, despite doctor's orders." I frowned. "She says she's healed up enough to command the engagement strategically."

Applejack: "She dun learn't too much from ya, honeybun. She's gonna push herself to an early grave." She frowned.

Dex: "And where do my Rangers fit in?"

K: "The Rangers will be the landing invasion spearhead at Jemulpo." I nodded. "Sacquet's Legionnaires will become the lead element in the Fusan Perimeter." I looked at Dex. "You're going in with Havoc's troops."

Dex: "Roger that, dude-sir." He gave a small grin.

Sargasso: "It seems.. everything is planned, then. What kind of resistance do you expect at the landing area?" She tilted her head.

K: "Moderate, but nothing we can't handle. If I'm right, and they're doing something like a mirrored repeat of what happened in my world, we might be meeting a rear column heading to Fusan, or we might see very little resistance at all." I shrugged. "Either way, with the Neighponese army's contributions, we have more than enough troops to build a steel wall. Hammer-and-Anvil strategy."

Sargasso: "Who'll command the landing at Jemulpo?" She shrugged slightly.

K: "You. You have the most combat experience." I nodded. "I'll be landing at Jemulpo, and helping coordinate on the ground." I gestured to the map. "I'm hoping this'll be easy. If the North Cowreans are involved? This gets messy, and fast. That's why the special grain carrier is with us.." I looked at everyone in the room, as Blinda entered.. looking frail, but alive.

Blinda: "It's actually the HMS Cloudsdale - the world's first operational aircraft carrier." She patted me gently on the hip, and sat down. "And it's loaded with one of Bright Eyes' atomic warheads." She looked at Applejack. "Hey."

Applejack: "Yer a durn fool, Tank." She hugged her. "But yer my friend. Ferever."

K: "Colonel Blinda, you have command of the 3rd Marines." I nodded, turned, and knelt far enough to pin her new rank on her.

Blinda: "I'll do my best, sir. You know that." She gave me a determined, but tired, smile.

K: "Don't push it." I nodded. "I'm taking the field, you only need to coordinate."

Blinda: "Aye, sir." She nodded.

K: "The warhead is a last resort. The captain of the Cloudsdale has special orders. If I call in the code "Ash Wind" she will break off with a small escort, and use the weapon against Nanjing, Khyanga."

Sargasso: "That's.. the last thing you wanted." She frowned.

Blinda: "I was the one who suggested it. If the Khyangese get involved, we're looking at a two front war. We just don't have the ponypower to deal with that." She shook her head slightly. "The only option we have is a decapitation strike against their government, and one that will ensure nationwide chaos. They know we have the weapons, but they'll be expecting a Crystal Kingdom airship to deliver it. Not a smaller strike bomber."

K: "Let's hope it doesn't come to that." I nodded. "It'll be several days until we reach Fusan."

Dr. Well Wishes: "And until then, young lady, you need to rest." He patted her shoulder, and looked at me.. he was going to say something, but declined, patted me on the hip, and escorted Blinda out.

Havoc: "Man, I hoped it wouldn't come to this. At all." He shook his head. "I wonder what Colonel Williams would say?"

K: "He'd probably feel like I do - I don't want to use it, but I will if I have to, if it means less death." I shrugged gently. "If the Herdintern Pact declares war on NEIGHTO, Tirek will destroy us, or he'll have plenty of time to re-amass his forces, grow his technology, and make the fight against him even harder. We can't let that happen."

Sargasso: "Either way.. we're scheduled to pick up the Royal Navy and Prench Navy reinforcements in a few hours, then the Germanes next morning, and the Roamans in the afternoon." She nodded. "We'll be in Cowrea in 12 days or so."

K: "Alright. Everyone just.. take it easy until then." I shrugged a bit.

I took AJ back to the command staff cabins, where the girls were. Toola was painting us all together in Ponyville. Rarity was doing Pinkie's hair. Twilight was talking to Gilda and Dash. Fluttershy was talking to Harmony Bunny.. I just gave her a look. The last time her bunny came with, it died..

She just gave me a beaming grin.

Blinda was laying in her cot on the far side of the suite. The General Staff Quarters had an outer bedroom/living area fit for 14, including bunks, and a private suite for myself.. and Applejack, actually. The staff suite included a planning table and a kitchenette. And some pony grade embellishments.

I went over and sat next to Blinda.

K: "Colonel." I smiled a little.

Blinda: "K." She smiled back.

K: "You really should be back in Equestria." I shrugged.

Blinda: "And what did you do when you had your blood sucked from your sweat pores?" She gave me a little frown, like, I have no room to speak.

K: "Okay, I give." I shrugged a bit, and looked at Dr. Well Wishes.

Well Wishes: "She'll recover, alright. She was most fortunate she had the second best doctor in Equestria to do surgery on her, right after it happened." He smirked, brimming with ego. "She did lose some of her liver, you know, but you probably also know, that's one organ that actually grows back." He gestured with his right hoof.

K: "What's her treatment plan?" I looked between them.

Well Wishes: "Nutrient-rich IV's for the next twelve days, with bed rest and low intensity exercise." He gave a dismissive hoof-wave. "Then re-evaulate."

Fluttershy: "Harmony and I will look after her, K." She smiled.

Well Wishes: "Yes, my.. newest nurse, over here.." He ahem'd. "Fluttershy, I can't imagine why you took nursing.."

Fluttershy: "We need it." She nodded. "Redheart is going to be pregnant for another two months, almost." She grinned a little.

K: "We'll be back from Cowrea by then, I hope." I gestured a bit, and patted Blinda on the shoulder. "Does it hurt?"

Blinda: "Oh, a bit. It's mostly that I get tired so very easily." She frowned. "I've never been this weak, and I hate it."

Well Wishes: "You could have died instead." He chuckled.

K: "Yeah." I looked over at Well Wishes. "You know, it's ironic. When this war started.. and I'm going to get very meta-universe on you, here.. you reminded me of a character from another television show - not a cartoon, like you were, but a live show, called MASH. A certain Dr. Pierce. He hated the war going on around him - the Korean War - and especially hated the men running it, committing what could be seen as treasonous acts, at times, to stop them from doing what he thought was wrong. He was a military doctor, but his goal was to just end the war, damned the consequences, and leave." I chuckled a bit. "And here we are, going to Cowrea, the equivalent of Korea, and about to fight the very same war, with about the same level of technology or so.. and you hate the war, but you don't hate me, any more. You've changed. We're going to the place where your kindred spirit made his fictional mark, and you're now nothing like him." I reached out and patted his shoulder.

Well Wishes: "You're right. I don't hate you, K.." He looked down. "..I'm a bit ashamed about how I acted at first. I didn't think about the consequences of just not fighting. After what I heard happened in Maine.. even after Ponyville.. I realized that if we don't fight, worse things will happen. We can only rely on each other, your judgment, and our own hearts to end this war as best we can - alive, with Tirek defeated, and us able to live our lives in peace." He grimaced a bit.

K: "I forgave you years ago." I shook my head slowly. "We're friends, Well." I pulled him into a hug.

Well Wishes: "Ah! General! Ah.. bah!" He gave up and hugged back.

Pinkie: "SEE?! This is what I mean when I say K has magic! The magic of friendship, like, he can make friends out of enemies, and make friends out of strangers, and it's magical, because he isn't even FROM here, and he can still find that common ground, and be friends, and support each other-"

Twilight: "We get the point, Pinkie." She chuckled.

We'd be in Cowrea in a few days, and after that, we'd have a fight on our hands. I hoped we were ready for it.. I hoped this would go a lot smoother than my Korea did.

Part 2: Dark Harbor

TIME: 14:24 ERDT
DATE: War Day 644/8 Primaus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Fusan Harbor, Kingdom of Cowrea

I was transferred to the Thuringia, which was acting as the force flagship, given that all the other capital ships had needed to return to their nations of origin for repairs after Neighpon. Equestria wasn't the only nation that had underestimated the wear and tear on machinery - Germaneigh was the only one that hadn't, which came from a long tradition of constructing, of all things, railroad engines.

VAdm. Kaltbluter: "General! Ist good to see you again!" He escorted me on to the deck.

I had the girls with me, plus Havoc and Sacquet, and the replacement Royal Navy senior officer.

K: "Vice Admiral Kaltbluter, may I introduce Vice Admiral Winsome Goodenough, Ambleon Royal Navy." I nodded to her.

Vice Admiral Goodenough was a tall, stately lady, that, despite her rank, insisted on wearing the feminine uniform dress, instead of slacks. She was mature aged, with a few streaks of grey in her lemon mane, and a rust coat. She even had white hoofcaps on her forelegs. She extended her hoof to Admiral Kaltbluter.

VAdm. Goodenough: "Admiral." She nodded formally, curtly.

VAdm. Kaltbluter: "Mein lady." He bowed as he accepted her hoof, clicking his heels together as he did so, and while moving to kiss her hoof, did not do so, as was Germane social standards.

VAdm. Goodenough: "Such manners! I feel we shall get along well, Admiral." She accepted her hoof back with a small grin. "Despite my adherence to social standards, the sailors have given me the nickname Granny Admiral.." She sighed slightly. "..I regret to say, that short of a lifetime of sailing, and organizing papers, I have no experience in a fighting navy, so I shall defer to your superior experience, Admiral Kaltbluter."

VAdm. Kaltbluter: "Ja, mein lady." He smiled, and ushured forth his wife. "Zis ist mein wife, Hauptmann zur See Kaltbluter." He looked up at Thuringia's superstructure. "She commands zis fine ship."

HzS Kaltbluter: "Admiral." She saluted, crisply.

K: "You remember Vice Admiral Tortellini, and Admiral Lauzun, of course." They were behind me as well. "And let me introduce Kontradmiral Wadislawa Bialagora." I gestured to a statuesque, white-coated, fairly young mare in a Polelish Navy uniform. "She commands the Polish naval forces. Such as they are."

Kont. Bialagora: "Ladiez taj Gentlecolts.." Her accent was incredibly thick. "I regret to say, I vas chozen zat I could speak Eqvestrian better zan my fellow Admirals." She shrugged. "I was Captain last week'n." She gestured to her ships. "Poleland has small navy. Armored cruiser Prince Korlowski, Scout Cruisers Krakow taj Torun, Frigates Lodz taj Chelm." She nodded. "Plus our Hussars."

VAdm. Kaltbluter: "Ja, vithout your Hussars, ze General vould be dead right now, I sink." He smirked a little. "Velcome, Admiral Bialagora."

VAmm. Tortellini: "Yes! Yes.. welcome, Admiral.." He swept in, bowed, and plucked her hoof for a kiss. "I am Vice Ammiraglio Giovanni Tortellini!"

There was a thump from his flanks. Contessa Tortellini was RIGHT behind him.

Contessa Tortellini: "Forgive'a my husband.." She gently seperated them. "Sometimes, his heart thinks before the rest of him." She glared at him.

His.. heart. Right. Everyone chuckled, but Admiral Bialagora. She looked a bit flustered.

K: "You'll be okay, 'Lada." I was already on informal terms with her, as we'd spoken as much as possible during the trip. "Gio means well, honest."

Rarity: "Yes, darling. He's just far too welcoming of female company for his own good." She gave Lada a small grin.

VAdm. Kaltbluter: "Come. Forest Spirit unt zee other officers are in our vardroom."

We paced along the deck, and I noted that the Germane cruisers were positioned for ship-to-shore artillery support - I wondered how tight the ring around the city was.

The Thuringia's wardroom was about as large as the Ceasar's, save, Kaltbluter didn't have a veritable feast of luxury goods staked out, with fresh cappuchino and the like. Instead, simple coffee and sandwiches, with some olives and pickles, and a small tray of herring. Gio seemed a bit disappointed, but satisfied himself with a couple ham sandwiches.. which his wife replaced with watercress when he wasn't looking.

VAdm. Tortellini: "So, Spirit, my old'a friend! How goes the war, eh?" He waved a welcoming arm to him.

I noted Forest Spirit had a bandage on his right foreleg, covered mostly by his uniform jacket.

K: "Judging by your face, not as well as we'd like." I grabbed a couple sandwiches and coffee, then sat.

AJ had two sandwiches (note that Germane sandwiches are made on a smaller loaf of bread than American/Western standards, so, two of theirs isn't quite one American-style sandwich), coffee, and some pickles, and sat right next to me.

Forest Spirit: "The only think I'm thankful for, is that we have good medical personnel. We've suffered an overall loss of 20% ponypower. Most of them are alive.. but a good number of them won't be fighting any wars ever again. The North Cowreans-"

K: "Oh, fuck!" I interjected. "Continue."

Forest Spirit: "-like to use landmines and grenades. A LOT. There's a large number of amputees..." He shook his head. "..they're not nice to prisoners, either. They tend to be tortured for information, then executed." He shrugged, and shook his head again. "They take their time, K."

K: "Well, shit." I scowled. "Have you seen any Khyangese?"

Forest Spirit: "Actually.." He looked to the inner hallway of the wardroom. "..Comrade?"

Comr. Div. Chmn. Kang: "Ah.. General, we meet again." He wasn't in a Mao Suit any more. "I must express my thanks for your.." He looked around the room. "..influence on my career. In exchange.. my government has given me field command of the region bordering Cowrea. And authority to negotiate. Presently, we take no stance on the Cowrean Conflict." He shrugged.

K: "Kang. Long time. You're looking well." I gave a very gentle smirk, that he was in a formal military uniform, now. "Division Chairman, eh? I see Keng Wan has.. been replaced." I was delicate on purpose - Chinese/Khyangese in-jokes often significantly downplay negative outcomes.

CDC Kang: "Indeed." He sat, with a briefcase.. and an orderly.

K: "Well. You'll be.. bemused.. to know that my decadent western title has grown. I'm now officially General-Field Marshal Sir K---- K---, Supreme Allied Commander of NEIGHTO, Commander-in-Chief of the Equestrian Armed Forces, and Knight of the Crystal Realm." I looked at Forest Spirit. "Cadence is pregnant, I'm the Godfather."

CDC Kang: "Oh!" He chuckled heartily. "Indeed, it HAS become rather decadent, hasn't it?" He couldn't stop grinning - partly because he knew I understood the humor.

Applejack: "Kang." She nodded to him. "We didn't meet b'fore, but ah'm Applejack K---, Lady of the Crystal Realm, an' General K---'s wife." She just gave him a touch of country sass.

CDC Kang: "A lovely wife." He nodded. "She looks quite strong, too."

K: "Stronger'n you." I looked down and sipped my coffee.

CDC Kang: "HA! Hahaha.. I suppose I trotted into that one, yes?" He grew serious. "My government understands the gravity of this situation, and the level of authority you have-"

K: "I will not invade a nation that is a partner in peace, Comrade." I stated, cutting him off. "No prattle. I have no desire to start a war with you. But, you will let us settle the situation on the Cowrean Peninsula ourselves, our way. If you want to accept refugees, that's on you, but I won't tolerate Khyanga setting up a North Cowrean government-in-exile or any such ridiculousness. I know your government wants a buffer state against NEIGHTO - too bad." I looked at the 'grain carrier' visible from the open deck-side door to the Wardroom. "Toola?"

Toola Roola: "Yup!" She stepped to the open door, and shot a pen flare through it.

This was the signal to cut loose the massive tarp covering the ship.. HMS Cloudsdale.. and her full, angled, flight deck.

K: "Say hello to the world's first operational aircraft carrier, Kang. If you have observers anywhere near us, you'd see it sooner or later." I sipped my coffee again. "I have 17 megaton atomic devices loaded on it." I looked up at him. "My bargaining chip."

CDC Kang: "Wh-.." He looked very nervous, all of a sudden. *Ahem!* "Comrade K..."

K: "Don't make me use it, Kang. I said before I'd regret having to do violence to you or your troops - you're a decent ponybeing, and you care about those beneath you. So do I. If Khyanga gets involved militarily, it'll be a disaster. I know, I saw this happen in my world, and it ended in a stalemate, becasue my leaders didn't have my resolve to achieve victory. If this had just been Tirek's forces, we wouldn't be talking. We're only here because your government wants something out of this war - some advantage, if they can get it. Just like what happened in my world. And you'd get the same damn thing - a barking dog that pisses on the neighbor's lawns and makes an annoyance of itself, doing more harm than good to your interests. I'm going to prevent a century or more of tension, fear, and low level conflict that could threaten to erupt into a nuclear war in the future." I pointed right at him. "I would trade the entire population of your major cities right now, for peace later. And I have the means to carry through with that. You, still, do not. That window may close in the futute, your people are very clever, as are you."

CDC Kang: "..I understand. Comrade." He seemed more defeated than disappointed. "Once again, you prove your strategic prowess." He shrugged. "I don't think my superiors would blink if they thought a conventional war was in the offing, again. But, erasing whole cities? With no ability to counter? That is far different.. seventeen megatons?" He was genuinely curious.

K: "At least. It's untested, but my calculations with atomic devices is backed by my years of study. If it has a runaway reaction, it could pull 21 or so. That's enough to wipe out a small county." I nodded to him. "You know I'll pick the biggest cluster of lives I can.. and account for your own limited countermeasures. I know you better than you know yourself, Kang."

CDC Kang: "Indeed! You.. impress me, K. Nopony here would have the courage to do what need be done. But, you're not a pony."

K: "I'm not." I finished my ham sandwich. "Cheers to your promotion, Comrade. You're a wise one. I hope we have more dialogue with you and other wise leaders of Khyanga in the future, as we work towards peace." I raised my coffee cup to him. "Now, I'm sure you have to report this to your superiors, and we have strategy to discuss." I looked at one of the Wardroom attendants. "Herr Bootsmann, Begleiten Sie ihn zu seinem Schiff." I nodded to Kang.

Without further discussion, he got up and left, escorted by the petty officer from the Thuringia.

I looked at the remaining admirals and senior marine officers, and shrugged.

Rarity: "I can tell - they thought this was a bit overly aggressive.." She looked at them.

Fosberry had been frozen in a pose with her sandwich halfway into her mouth for at least a solid minute. Eisensattel was calm, but looked right at me. Gio was the only one going to town on his food, not seeming to care.

VAdm. Tortellini: "Friends! Friends! You are'a shocked, eh?" He looked at me and patted me on the back, hard. "Kang is right - he is notta pony, eh? But he is one of us. And he is our leader. I trust him. No matter the scary things he says - I know K will do what needs to be done." He looked at Fosberry. "Even if'a we lack'a'de'stren'th to do it ourselves. He care'a so much for our lives, he is willing to.. destroy his own morals to protect us. Who could'a ask for a better friend?"

Bgdr. Fosberry: "I.. you're right, Giovanni." She shrugged.

Pulkownik Pasterzki: "Indeed, War is changing." She sighed wistfully. "Soon, our Hussars will be in metal boxes."

K: "Quite. But, you have the honor of one of the last mass cavalry charges in Equestrian history, on the hoof." I nodded.

Eisensattel: "Ja. Und ze time of ze atom ist here." He shrugged.

K: "Only briefly. I have every intention of burying this secret forever when the war is over." I shrugged a bit myself. "Now, on to the plan for Fusan.."

Reservations about my threats? I expected that, but these were military officers. Even before the war, when the Guards they originated from, were mainly for parades and looks, they were disciplined. They understood what it meant to be afraid of the beast they claimed to tame - here, being much softer than dealing with humans.

Still. I agreed. After this war, no nukes. That had to be the rule. I hated the thought of what nuclear brinksmanship would do to this world.. but I, too, felt that pull I'm sure Curtis LeMay and others felt - that a monopoly on such things would bring its own kind of peace. Almost like General LeMay himself was whispering sweet nothings into my ear about Nuclear Dominance, and how Equestria could run all of North Equus, like America had run Europe...

No. Absolutely not. I discarded such thoughts out of hand, and focused on the conventional...

Part 3: Fusan Perimeter

TIME: 16:42 ERDT
DATE: War Day 644/8 Primaus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Fusan Harbor, Kingdom of Cowrea

I was met on shore by the remaining parts of my General Staff, and saw them all banged up somehow. Even Norfy was sporting a gash on his shoulder.

K: "Norf. We didn't need you after all." I shrugged.

Katrina: "He was scared of me." She grinned sweetly, and gave him a peck on the horn. "And the fact that K was an adult human, not a child. He's gone back to sleep."

Norfy: "I still think I should have come with.." He sighed. "..but if I hadn't.."

Cosmic: "It's been bad, K." He shook his head.

Gaze: "Aye, suh." He growled.

Gorcat: "Ah.. there's my future sister-in-law." He actually hugged Dash.

Dash: "Ah! Unexpected, there!" She was a bit surprised, but hugged back.

Gorton: "Nephew." He nodded. "How goes?"

Gorcat: "Bad. Casualties are heavy each time.." He looked towards the edges of the city. "..they stay just out of naval gunfire range." Then back to the shore. "Well.. we have bigger guns, now."

K: "Cosmic?" I smirked a little. "Look." I nodded to the artillery tractors pulling the new (to the field) 155mm guns.

Cosmic: "HOT DOG!" He skipped in place. "Fully motorized?!"

K: "And that's not all." I took the radio mic from Toola Roola. C> "Alpha Actual to Falcon-3. Clear for flyby and strike."

A flight of four F/A-1 Falcons zoomed overhead at about the speed of a biplane. Lifting body fighter-bombers, with pusher engines. Bright Eyes' design. They were multi-role aircraft, and I thought it best our first aircraft be that way, so, if we hadn't time for specialization, we could pump out a lot of one design and just overwhelm the enemy with a "Jack-of-all, master-of-none" aircraft, like the Sherman Tank had done on the ground, in World War II.

Everyone ooo'd and ahh'd at the sight of them. They had a top speed of 282kp/h, or about 175mp/h. Certainly faster than the cruise speed of most any Pegasus, Griffon, or other flighted species, save Rainbow Dash being able to break the sound barrier.

The four aircraft heaved over and dove, strafing an enemy position with 11mm machine gunfire, and firing a spread of 70mm "Hydra" Rockets. Yes, I reused the name. The hits and little fireballs were answered with scattering and panic.. from our hill, we could see the enemy flee from the position the fighters had strafed, having no answer.

Cosmic: "Oh, golly gee!" He beamed with excitement.

Gaze: "S'what's'a plan, suh?" He gazed at the sight, but was businesslike in his tone.

K: "I'm taking my General Staff on an end-run around the Fusan Perimeter. Sacquet and his legion, plus a few new volunteers, and our replenishment forces will bring the perimeter units up to full strength. The 3rd Marines, 3rd Army, and 5th Airborne are making a landing north of here, at Jemulpo. WEBLEY!"

Webley came running up, and level-flight tackled me to the ground, hugging me tightly.

Webley: "I'm so glad you're safe! Ohmigosh, this place is TERRIBLE on my Internet connection - like, I get SO MANY bad visions and things-"

Norfy: "Which have saved our flanks several times." He put in.

Webley: "I had this horrible nightmare about.." She got up off of me. "..mirrors, sir. K." She looked down. "I thought you were going to die. I was sure when the ships came in, it'd be Luna telling us.." She sniffled.

Still a pony.

I got to my butt, and pulled her in for a hug. Katrina, Applejack, and Fluttershy joined in.

Fluttershy: "You should know, Webley.. he doesn't die so easily." She 'hmm'd' a bit.

K: "I'm fine. But, I need you to take field command of the 5th Airborne Battalion temporarily. They're all green." I got up, finally. "They need an experienced commander for their first operation." I pulled out the operational map, and set it down.

Webley: "..all due respect, sir, that's not a Major's position.." She looked down at me.

K: "You're right, Colonel." I turned and put her new rank pins on her. "You're promoted. Again."

Norfy: "Not bad." He patted her on the shoulder.

Cosmic: "Hey! Congrats!"

Gaze: "Oi." He just grinned, cheesily. "Ma'am!"

Webley: "Ch'GUYS!" She rolled her eyes. "Really, K?"

K: "Really. Now, I want the 5th to land by parachute right here." I pointed at the map. "On the other side of Seoul. They're to blockade all roads leading from the city, and from the north and south along this line." I indicated on the map. "When the Marines and Army troops arrive, we'll catch any occupation unit between two forces. After that, it's a matter of moving across the peninsula.. and we'll have TANKS for that." I smirked.

Gaze: "TANKS! Finally! Oi, e'er since Marelin, I been wantin' a big steel box t'hide in.." He gave a grin.

Forest Spirit: "And I'll have command here, still?" He looked up at the city.

K: "Yes. Time it to four days on the nose, then I want an offensive.. punch north and west at the same time. Make a line across the peninsula. By that time, Neighponese Army units from Bushin-5 will arrive and reinforce you. We crush the enemy between two forces. Then, we advance north to the Khyangese Border and stop there." I indicated on the map. "Straight north. Advance with everything we have. When we get to this line here.." I indicated a line just on the Cowrean side of the border. "..we stop. Khyanga has agreed not to intervene in the war, in exchange, I'm giving them this four kilometer deep strip to have as a demilitarized zone. About 98% of Cowrea will be in the King's hands.. it's better than 50% or nothing." I shook my head slowly. "I'd rather take it all, but I want to placate the Khyangese a bit and avoid needing to execute a nuclear strike." I shook my head. "There's a bomb along with the fleet. Seventeen megatons. Enough to take out any city on the planet."

Forest Spirit: "I understand." He nodded. "I'll have, which units?"

K: "Sacquet's, the ones you have now brought up to full strength and then some, Bushin-5, and one Armored Company. Each Tassigny Medium Tank has a crew of five. That's twelve tanks. They take the same shells as the 76mm field guns. You'll also have the 155mm batteries." I nodded to him. "They have two and a half times the range of the 76's, and a bit more than twice the payload. The gun crews are the same ones when they were on stationary duty, so they know how to lay the guns right." And pointed to the shore. "They also have artillery tractors.. those are a seperate unit. They have fuel and ammo carriers organic to them. We don't have a whole lot of fuel - enough for the tanks and artillery to carry out the operation and perhaps a day or two besides. Another supply ship is coming, and should be here before they run dry, with more fuel for them." I stood up. "Blinda's taking charge of the landing operation at Jemulpo."

Forest Spirit: "Is she UP to it?" He tilted his head.

K: "Ahh.. you know her." I waved a hand, dismissively. "Try stopping her."

Webley: "Yeah." She looked down a moment, then back up. "Don't let her go on shore, okay?"

K: "I'll.. take that." I nodded sharply. "Pinkie?"

Toola: "She's right." She shook her head, and Pinkie absolutely mimiced her.

K: "Okay, then. You have your orders. The supply ships should be done unloading in a few hours." I gestured to everyone. "Come on, let's get back to the ships. When those supply ships are done offloading everything, I want to make speed to Jemulpo."

Forest Spirit: "Going to have a talk with the King?" He tilted his head to the side.

K: "I don't know. Have the Cowreans made any significant contribution?" I gestured.

Forest Spirit: "We raised about a battalion of soldiers.. we had enough extra equipment for that.." He looked back towards the edge of the city. "..I don't know what your human Cowreans are like, but.. I hate to say it, sir, they have no stomach for a fight. None. They expected us to do all the heavy fighting, and when pressed by North Cowreans, they usually retreated with little combat." He sighed. "They're even worse than some ponies."

Sergeant Ochre came up at that point, and nodded to us - no saluting in an active combat zone.

Ochre Wave: "General. Commandant." He handed Forest Spirit a note, which he then showed me.

It was a note from the commander of the Cowrean Army force, complaining that they have no proper quarters for their troops, were requesting specific foods that I personally considered luxury items in a combat environment, and complained that they had not yet been paid.

K: "..Spirit?" I cocked a brow.

Firest Spirit: "They're cows, sir." He snorted. "They have the same quarters our troops do - field tents, and whatever abandoned structure is available." And lowered his head. "They've been complaining about pay since the beginning."

K: "Guys?" I looked back at my three best stallions.

Gaze: "They dun' like takin' orders from ponies, suh." He made a face. "What ones can speak Equestrian, anyhows." Another snort. "An' they complain if they have to do this-and-that.. normal soldierin' stuff, suh."

Norfy: "They're highly disagreeable. Primadonnas." He fixed the perimeter with an icy gaze. "I commanded a company, briefly. They refused my orders to stand and hold a position - this ended up endangering a Marine platoon, and we lost several of our own. Instead, they fell back when they caught sight of the enemy."

Cosmic: "They don't like manual labor - we tried assigning them to haul ammo carts and things. They only did one or two trips, then they refused to work any more." He lowered his head. "I don't want to sound mean, sir.. you know that.. but, K, why are we saving them? They don't seem to care! And they're so ungrateful." He sighed. "They don't even care about their dead, sir. What ones did fall dead, they just left them there. I don't think they'd care if you turned the lot of them into steaks, sir." He sat down. "A lot of the soldiers here feel the same way. Like, we know fighting Tirek is important, but.."

Forest Spirit: "They're only keeping this up because of you, K." He put a hoof on my shoulder. "They trust you."

K: "You're right." I stood up. "I want answers. Prince Milk-Sum's attitude was completely different at the NEIGHTO conference."

Time to have a word with the king...

[End of Part 3]

Part 4: Royal Cow

TIME: 18:44 ERDT
DATE: War Day 644/8 Primaus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Temporary Royal Quarters, Fusan City, Kingdom of Cowrea

I came in with the girls, the lads, Forest Spirit, Brigadier Fosberry, and Pulkownik Pasterzki. I was alone as far as royal things were concerned. And I was very unhappy about this sad state of affairs. I had spent the lives of my troops, and my allies' troops, and for what?

K: "I demand to see your king. NOW." I entered, and told the first official-looking cow I found.

Cow Royal Official: "I am so soddy, King has retired for night. Tomorro-" I pushed past him. "YOU CANNOT GO IN THERE!" He screamed.

Two guards armed with lances approached us.

K: "I'm going in there. Step aside, or I'm going to eat all three of you." I said, very darkly.

Cow Royal Official: "They are king's guards! They die-"

I whipped my Bradley up and hosed down both of the guards. Forest Spirit, and Gaze, grabbed the Royal Official, and subdued him, tying him up.

K: "-they did die." I finished for him. "Come on."

I walked into the king's quarters, and I was instantly reminded of what a cow stable would look like, if the cow was, indeed, revered for their station. Silk pillows, curtains, and the like. Gold statues. A very nice rug.

Basically, so very nice that I questioned if the King had fled his capital with half his bedroom packed away.

K: "Your Royal Highness." I announced loudly.

He snored.

I walked over to his huge bed, grabbed his left side limbs, and YANKED him out of bed.

K: "GET UP, YOU FAT COW!" I screamed at him.

King Milk-Sum: "WHO DARE!?" He bellowed back.

I slapped him across the muzzle, twice.

King Milk-Sum: "YOU DARE!!" He headbutted me.

I kicked him in the neck, punched the side of his head, grabbed his bull horns, and wrestled him to the ground, putting him in bovine submission.

K: "Now, you listen to me, you brisket with legs. My stallions and mares are dying out there! FOR YOU! For your country! And your own people, and it seems you, have ZERO GRATITUDE!" I screamed in his ear. "The so-called SOLDIERS you gave me, are worthless! I've lost TROOPS because of their COWARDICE!" I released him and stood up. "GIVE ME ONE REASON WHY! ONE REASON WHY I SHOULDN'T CUT MY LOSSES, LEAVE COWREA, AND LET TIREK TURN YOU INTO HAMBURGERS!"

King Milk-Sum: "BECAUSE WE ARR PAHT OF NEIGHTO!!" He spat at me.

K: "NOT GOOD ENOUGH!" I screamed back. "THE NEIGHTO ALLIANCE MEANS EACH NATION CONTRIBUTES SOMETHING OF VALUE! YOU DON'T GET TO MILK OFF OF THE REST OF US, WHILE YOU GROW FAT AND LAZY!" I jabbed my finger at him.

King Milk-Sum: "YOU ARR PONIE! YOU SHOULD SERVE US! PROVIDE FOR US!" He got to his feet, and paced forwards. "WE ARR COW! IT IS OUR STATION TO RECEIVE!" He shook his head. "Griffons would und'ah'stan! Is why we have Griffon servants!" He snorted, bullishly. "We give milk, we give cheese, we give'ah our bodies when we die! In return, YOU give US! Everything! YOU ser-"

I turned around and started walking out.

K: "Contact Tirek's or the North Cowrean's field commanders and reequest a cease-fire. Then order everyone to re-embark to the fleet. We're done, here." I shook my head.

King Milk-Sum: "YOU BETRAY!"

That was his final mistake. Charging me, trying to gore me with his horns - he IS a bull, after all.

Norfy knocked me out of the way, slamming himself into me at the same instant he cast an ice spell on the floor, to prevent the King from gaining traction..

..the King hit the ice, slipped, slid, and finally fell down, knocking several large statues down with him, sliding along the floor, at velocity, and hitting the wall.

He also stopped moving.

I got up, helped Norfy up, and dusted him off.

K: "You okay? Thanks for the save!"

Norfy: "I'm fine, K! How's the king, though?"

Pinkie went over to the King, and poked him with her bayonet. Several times. Not stab, poked.

Pinkie: "So, K, you like beef, right? If I'm right, he's going to be delicious!"

Twilight: "PINKIE!! How COULD you!?" She was shocked.

Rarity: *Dismissive snort* "You heard him - in death, they give us.. him.. meat." She kicked him. "Ungrateful BOVINE!" She growled a little. "The ladies in Ponyville were SO nice! SO gracious! Not like this spoilt tub of lard. Literally."

K: "Well, fuck, he's dead, isn't he?" I paced over, and realized, indeed, the King's corpse was not bleeding much. "FUCK!"

Norfy: "Sorry, K." He lowered his head.

Gaze: "Aw, come off it, Norf! Wha's a lil' Regicide between friends?" He chuckled.

K: "Get that royal official in here." I nodded to the doors.

My team did as instructed, and I let them remove his gag.

K: "As Supreme Allied Commander of NEIGHTO, I am hereby revoking Cowrea's membership." I nodded to him. "Furthermore, your king is dead. He tried to kill me, and one of my officers protected me. They tried to do so in a non-lethal fashion, but.." I shook my head. "..he had too much velocity when he hit the wall."

Cow Royal Official: "YOU BARBARIANS! Killing our king is punishable by death!" He shut up when Forest Spirit stuck his knife towards his eye.

K: "We will be leaving as soon as is practicable. Your people can suffer at Tirek's hands until the war ends. If he genocides the lot of you, I won't be the least bit sad." I shook my head. "When you ask people to die for you, you treat their lives with more respect than your own. We came here to save you, but you don't care. So, I'm not going to let another one of my soldiers be maimed or killed in a land that doesn't give us the least bit of gratitiude, and asks instead that we blindly serve you and be grateful for the chance. That's not what war is about. And you're going to find that out real quick-"

Kang and an armed escort entered.

K: "Perfect." I nodded. "You made the guess."

Kang: "Not as such. We had.. someone.. tell us you went to see the King." He looked at the mess. "I see it did not end well."

K: "Comrade, Cowrea is yours. I ask you arrange a ceasefire, and we will simply leave." I bowed my head to him. "I ask forgiveness for my harsh language earlier - I foolishly assumed I was standing up for a people that desperately desired my help. It turns out, I was instead spending blood and treasure on a peoples that simply did not care. I wasted the lives of my troops, and I caused you to lose face." I actually bowed lower as I spoke.

Kang: "Oh, come, come, General." He patted my shoulder. "You are forgiven. We know you care so much about those around you, that you are willing to light up whole cities in hellfire to defend them. I did not expect you to be as humble in admitting your errors."

K: "I thank you, Kang. Can you arrange a cease-fire?" I earnestly implored. "I want the killing to end.. for now."

Kang: "A cease-fire has been arranged, Comrade. And you will find, interestingly, that Tirek's forces.. are no longer among the North Cowrean Herdintern Forces pressing against your lines." He smirked a little.

K: "I was outplayed and my heart betrayed by a culture filled with greater decadence and degeneracy than could be tolerated. Comrade Division Chariman Kang, I concede this victory to you." I bowed my head again.

Kang: "No, no.. it cannot be called a defeat if it did not happen on the field of battle - and you are poised to end this war with your own victory. So.. we shall call it.. peace with dignity." He smirked again. "Stalemate."

K: "Thank you, Comrade Kang." I nodded.

Kang: "Consider this repayment for my new position.. and likely for the promotion I will get for this.. political situation." He grinned broadly. "I hope when next we meet, K, your title is even longer and more decadent! You are humble when you are not the winner, and gracious in victory. You are one I could respect." And gestured. "Go, now."

So, the Cowrean War was officially over. A stalemate that would result in the Kingdom of Cowrea's eventual destruction. Equus' equivalent of the Korean War would end like my Vietnam War did - with the side 'my people' were supporting turning out to be run by a bunch of self-entitled pricks that didn't really care, who, in the end, we left to the wolves....

[End of Part 4]


Part 5: Not-Victory

TIME: 07:33 ERDT
DATE: War Day 657/21 Primaus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Royal Palace, Canterlot

Representatives from the rest of NEIGHTO were here to discuss the Cowrean siuation. Ambleon, Prance, Germaneigh, Poleland, Roam, Canida, Dragonshire, and the Crystal Kingdom.

Everyone was upset.

I had been informed that the dawn meeting would take place as soon as I could get there. When I pulled in to Fillydelphia Harbor, I took a train more or less straight there.

I walked in, still in my field uniform, and saw the assemblage of officials. Princesses Margaret, Escargot, and Cadence. King Solarenski. Ceasar Androlini. Queen Ember. Prince Hoffnungsteher. Prime Minister Spot. I pulled the Sword of Rainbow's Light from my belt, and set it down before them, and took a knee.

K: "Royal Hignesses, Mister Prime Minister. I have done the unforgivable. I have wasted the lives of the soldiers under my command, and I have done so for no gain whatsoever. I drastically misread the intentions of the Cowrean People, their desires, and their culture. They wished for us, for your ponies, to die, so they could be served." I didn't look at any of them - even Luna. "I had no idea they were so self-righteous, so greedy, and so ungrateful for the sacrifices we were prepared to make. Under my authority as Supreme Allied Commander, I ejected them from the NEIGHTO allaince, withdrew the soldiers under my command at the time, from the Cowrean Peninsula, and surrendered myself to the only available representative of the Governments of NEIGHTO - Prince Blueblood. He has escorted me here, at my request. If it suits Your Royal Highnesses, and you, Mister Prime Minister, I would tender my resignation as Supreme Allied Commander immediately." I bowed my head down completely.

There was silence.

Princess Margaret: "General K-"

Luna: "Beloved, I think you misunderstand.." She was being very warm and caring in her words.. beloved, in front of other royals?

King Solarenski: "My friend! No! I refuse such!" He clopped his hoof on the table.

Ceasar Androlini: "Citizen K.. what I have'a heard from Vice Ammiraglio Tortellini.. such a request, of yours.. I cannot accept, either."

Ember: "Hell no, I'm not letting you quit!" She snorted.

Prime Minister Spot: "That would be barking up the wrong tree, General. We've come a long way - I'm not going to have us chasing our tails again! I can't accept that offer, sir!" He pawed at his spot at the table.

Cadence: "That wasn't the reason for this conference, anyway, K!" She leaned forwards. "Get up.. please? Face us. With the same love and courage you had when you departed!"

Celestia: "Yes, General." She had full Mommy Voice going. "You have no reason to be this ashamed."

Escargot: "Marechal K.. this is true.." She sounded concerned. "You cannot resign. I would not accept, either! Sacre bleu." She sighed.

I stood up, but I kept my head down.

K: "I will always feel like I failed." I said, in low tones. "I made a grave error in thinking they had a culture close to yours-"

Celestia: "Ours. You are one of us, K." She reassured me.

K: "-that they would care about their own fate, and do anything to avoid being enslaved or defeated. I was terribly wrong. I was so terribly wrong, 172 ponies died, and another 212 are so greviously wounded, their war is over. My mistake cost lives. I will think of each one, for the rest of my life." I shook my head.

Celestia: "That isn't just your failing, K. We all thought the same." She reassured me.

I looked up at them, tears streaming from my eyes. Burning tears of shame and regret.

K: "But I'm the one that's supposed to know better! I'm the one you all trusted to run this war! And I made a fatal mistake for 172 ponies! And ruined the lives of another 212! I should.. I should have seen this coming. I should have known.." I was choked up. "..they're dead because I could only think of avoiding the military mistakes of my world - I forgot the political ones."

Escargot: "Oui. But, zat is our job, Marechal." She said, reassuringly.

Prince Hoffnungsteher: "Ja. Und we failed to vet zere intentions." He bowed his head. "Ift anysing, herr K, it is ve who failed you." He shook his head and looked up to me. "You heff saved mein life. You heff saved mein capital. Mein home. For me, ze troops of Germaneigh cannot accept any ozer leader."

Celestia: "We called you here, K, to tell you ourselves that we forgive you. That we're sorry we sent you on such a fool's errand, to save a people who did not care about being saved, who did not care enough about their own freedom to fight. You're still our Commander. And you always will be." She got out of her chair, came over, and hugged me.

I cried. Like a baby. In her arms. I cried for all of them that had died, that I would forever feel like I failed.

And I was forgiven.

The Rainbow Factory.. now that we knew its horrors, we had to track it down. That meant tracking down someone who knew about it.

The likely target was to hunt down the terror cells headed by Porkarius. Zorch had given us what he knew - the mooks were rarely told anything of importance, and the cell leaders were kept in the dark as much as possible.

So, I went to see Chemical Lens..


TIME: 13:47 ERDT
DATE: War Day 657/21 Primaus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Gendarme Headquarters, Canterlot

Her office was one of the largest rooms on the floor. She insisted on doing most of her own Forensic Science work herself. She HAD the talent for it. When I entered, I found her numbly staring at a pile of reports.

Her office was also a mess.

K: "Chem?" I eased in.

Chemical Lens: *Distractedly* "Yes, General."

K: "Are you okay?" I went over to her desk, and.. I had to clear a pile of newsprint from a chair to sit down. "This isn't like you."

Chemcial Lens: *Analytically* "I am attempting to corellate unusual incidents with possible movement of the terror cells-"

K: "He'll be alright, Chem." I interrupted her.

She was WORSE than Twilight!

Chemical Lens: "I.." Tears. She sharply turned her head away.

K: "Chem, he's going to be okay." I reached out and grabbed a foreleg, and held it.

Chemical Lens: "General.." She sniffed.

K: "Just K." I shook my head. "You look up to me like a Dad, you're going to address me as a person, not a rank."

Chemical Lens: "Whe.. When I heard.." She lowered her head to her desk, and cried softly.

K: "It's going to be okay. We got the main ones that did this." I nodded. "Wide's tough. He'll make it. He's recovering as we speak. Doc says it's going to take a while, but he WILL pull through.. and with your support, he'll even be good enough to return to duty." I held her foreleg in my hand, and rubbed her shin.

Chemical Lens: "I almost lost him." She made a maddened titter. "This is crazy! A year ago, it wouldn't've mattered at all! And here I am, falling to pieces.. because.. because.."

K: "You love him. And you didn't think it was possible in that hyper-logical little brain of yours, for you to love like that. Not after the things you've been through. Congradulations, Chem, you've come out the other side." I smiled to her.

Chemical Lens: "But, it HURTS!" She looked right at me.

I slid around the other side of the desk, got into a Slav Squat, and pulled her into my arms, and just let her cry. It took over half an hour, my legs cramped up, and they burned, but I refused to let her go.

When she finally let up, and slid out of my lap, I fell over, and had to use my arms to stretch my legs back out.

Chemical Lens: "I-I'm sorry, K."

K: "Nothing to be sorry for." I stretched. "You needed it. What kind of a father figure would I be, if I didn't care about you?"

Chemical Lens: "..thank you." She finally smiled.

K: "Have you been to visit him?" I tilted my head.

Chemical Lens: "..not lately." She lowered her head.

K: "Come on." I got back up, and stretched out fully. "We'll grab a lunch along the way, and.. you can sit and talk to him. Here's something Human medicine figured out ages ago.. people in Comas can hear EVERYTHING. If he hears your voice, telling him to keep fighting, to get better, that you LOVE him? He'll never stop until he gets better. And that's a fact." I nodded, firmly.

Chemical Lens: "Is that so?" *Analytically, but with a humored air* "Then, I suppose I should examine this possibility." She actually smiled! Probably for the first time in a couple weeks.

Together, we went to the hospital to check on him. And, Dusty, too, of course. I reflected on how, even with the wounded, there are many more casualties - mental health ones. Whatever this Spell of Carefree might be, it wasn't 100% effective, and sometimes, the "other wounded," really needed a friend.
