Part 1: Quantum of Decadence

TIME: UNKNOWN

LOCATION: UNKNOWN
THIS BULLSHIT AGAIN: MOST LIKELY

Again with the greyness. Again, me sitting up and seeing nothingness. What, was the Mystery Pony going to bitch at-

Discord: "Good, you've come."

K: "...wat."

I patted myself down - no weapons. Not that it mattered, I nearly killed him with my bare hands once before, and that was with a broken radius and before I got in shape. I lifted myself off the ground and.. realised he wasn't actually there. Not.. not like standing next to me. He was off a bit in the distance, by some colored area. I marched towards it. Ready. If he was going to fuck with me, now, I was going to kill him.

Discord: "I really did love her, you know."

He was staring at a stained glass window. A glorious beast stood in the center - a proud, long body. Hooves at the rear, cat's paws at front, and proper goat's horns jutting proudly up from his forehead. His wings were those of an eagle, his tail a snake's.

K: "You.. were.. a Chimera?" I was dumbstruck. "A proper Chimera?"

Discord: "Yes. That.. was me, once." He pawed at it gently. "But no longer."

He turned to me - he'd regained his horns, that I'd ripped off, but the bases of both of them were still.. swollen. They looked tender.

K: *Flatly* "What am I doing here?"

Discord: "Hah.. because everyone seems to think this War is my doing. It isn't. I'm about chaos, not strife. My tricks are entertaining! Oh, okay, a bit dangerous perhaps, but.. nothing like this."

He cast a glance to a crystal orb that showed him Princess Celestia. He waved a paw over it, and it showed her on the day we dedicated the War Memorial by the castle. It showed her crying.. his head drooped.. and though his back was turned to me, I saw a tear drop from his snout.

K: "You STILL love her!" I insisted. "You can't bear to see her in pain like this, can you?"

Discord: "There's no sense denying it." He placed a paw on the orb gently.. then let it drop away. "She thinks me a monster. I became a monster. Then I was humiliated and nearly killed by.."

K: "..one of the worst monsters to ever evolve. And there's billions of us. We're chaotic by our very nature. A cruel kindness, a savage beauty.. no wonder you picked me. My kind and loving heart, crossed with my terrible knowledge. You wanted me to raise an army for Celestia, then trip her up and make her go on the warpath again?"

Discord: "Pretty close. Actually, I was hoping that your romance with Luna would grow and you'd take such sympathy on her that you would offer her the chance to put Celestia in her place.."

K: "To make her feel like you did, when she rejected you."

Discord: "Exactly! I wanted her to have her comeuppance. To put her in the same place she put me. But.. you fell for the Apple Pony instead. Miss Honesty. This caused.. complications. Instead of Luna running to you when she started arguing with her sister, you were with Applejack instead. I'd hoped that confronting you.. would make you run back to Canterlot and aide Luna." He turned to me.. a flash of wickedness in his face for half a moment, then sadness again. "I was so jealous that you.. that she.. laid with you. You're far MORE a monster than I, yet.."

K: "She didn't exactly give me a choice, you know." I frowned.

Discord: "No, she didn't. No, no.. I'm over it." He gave a dismissive paw-wave. *Sigh* "Then you utterly destroyed me." He shrugged. "You nearly killed me. Be glad you didn't - you would have been cursed too."

K: "Cursed..? Does that mean.. you.. killed the last embodiment of Chaos?"

Discord gave me a half smirk.

K: "And you did it on purpose.." I continued. "You fell on your sword, so to speak, deliberately.. to.. protect her, didn't you?"

He zoomed over to me and grabbed my shirt with desperation. Tears in his eyes.

Discord: "YES! Yes.. the.. the last embodiment of Chaos.. he.. he wanted to make such chaos that Celestia's kindgom would have been destroyed! He.." *Sniff* "He would have killed her! Or hurt her so badly, that she would not have wanted to live." He grew slack, his grip loosening. "I had no choice... I had no other choice. But after I killed him, he warned me what would happen. That the power within him would kill me, bring me back, and make me just as bad as him. And if I didn't cause chaos, that the power of Chaos would eat me from within and turn me into something just as bad as he was. That.. that was the reason he acted. Because he held it in too long." He let go of me and slumped to the ground.

K: "You sacrificed yourself." I frowned and sat cross-legged in front of him. "I completely misjudged you. I'm sorry."

Discord: "Oh, no, no.. don't be sorry. What I've done since then has been pretty awful. I wanted Celestia bansihed from her own kindgom, that I might.. have her by my side again.."

K: "You wanted her so humiliated, that she would be banished, and have no other place to go but your arms.. so you could show her that you still loved her?"

Discord: "Sick, isn't it?" He frowned. "I have.. moments like this.. when the Chaos in the world is so that my power is drained.. sane moments.. I realize what I've become. And I'm afraid, K. I'm so very afraid." He put his head in his hands. "I'm just one Chimera. Was. There's.. so little I can do."

K: "And you can't end the war, either, because if the Chaos stops too suddenly, you'll go ape shit, am I right?"

Discord: "Exactly! And they say humans are stupid monkeys." He shrugged. "Or was that the Saiyans?"

K: "Prob.. probably the Saiyans." I scratched my head. "Either way.. then.. who's pulling the strings?"

Discord: "That's why I brought you here! I.. don't know who or what it is, but if it isn't stopped, more creatures will die."

K: "So, what, I have to save the world? What is this, Final Fantasy?" My mind was quite full of fuck.

Discord: "As if you weren't planning it already?" He asked, flatly.

K: "Okay, I was, I admit it." I shrugged. "So, do I kill Tirek or.. what's the deal here?" I said, hand-gesturing.

Discord: "I think something more powerful than Tirek is at hand here.. though Tirek's death would end all of this in a safe manner. Just one thing.."

K: "Yeah?"

Discord: "I must be dealt with before Tirek is killed, or I risk turning into the monster that I once slayed." He scowled. "While I'm still sane, I would like to avoid this."

K: "You know, Discord, you're not such a bad guy after all." I smirked.

Discord: "I'm Chaos, dear human. Not evil." He crossed his arms with a small smirk.

K: "Alright, how do I do this?" I shrugged.

Discord: "The Rainbow of Light." He said with a finality.

K: "..oh, Great Ceasar's Ghost.. THAT thing?"

Discord: "It's energy was used to make the Elements of Harmony, you know, but it's still around. It exists. And it must be used if Tirek is to be defeated."

K: "And you know all this because..?"

Discord: "Really! How ill-informed do you think I am?" He shrugged. "Though I have absolutely no idea where exactly it is, I know that it is not in Tirek's lands." And scratched his chin. "Specifics? Not so much."

K: "Alright.. one more question." I stated.

Discord: "Like I have anything better to do?"

K: "Where am I? Some pocket dimension of your creation? Dead? Half-Dead? Coma? What's.."

Discord: "You are not physically conscious at this moment, no, but your body is quite alive and.. I'm pretty sure it isn't terribly damaged."

K: "Can I have a look, then?" I pointed at the Crystal Orb.

Discord: "Oh, right."

He waved a hand over the orb and showed me.. the entire prep area was being shelled. Hard. Magical artillery of some kind.. damned Grogar. Luna was dragging me - my body, that is - away from a large smoldering crater.

K: "Soo... I'm in some kind of Limbo?"

Discord: "My personal limbo. I've been waiting for you to get knocked out. We had to talk - and in a situation where you didn't have means to cut me down before hearing me out."

K: "Oh.. uh.. nice place you've got here. Where's the exit?"

Discord: "The exit? You must make it yourself - this is a realm of Chaos. You should be especially suited to manipulating it. Oh, and, one last thing."

K: "Yeah?" I crossed my arms.

Discord: "I.. please don't tell Celestia my feelings, or what I did. It's far easier for her to hate me. If she knew the truth, it would crush her."

K: "I can do that." I said, grimly. "Just send me a message when you're ready to be sealed away. I'll arrange it, and white-wash the truth about it. I'm a Chicagoan. Lying is a profession where I'm from." I shrugged. "Now.. an exit."

I focused my mind and a door appeared. I was about to step through, when I gave Discord one last look. He was.. sad.

K: "For everything you've ever put me through... thank you. Yeah, I miss Earth, but.. I've found a happiness here I never thought I'd see."

Discord gave me a small grin.

Discord: "Chaos is Chaos.. sometimes in your favor, sometimes not. Sometimes both all at once."

K: "I hope you find something happy.. somewhere." I said, before stepping through.


TIME: 23:56 ERST
DATE: War Day 141
LOCATION: Ponyville Milita Headquarters

I awoke with my Field Jacket in Luna's teeth, her pulling me desperately as far from the Farm as possible.. we were about halfway into the large empty field near it, where other rear echelon personnel were also retreating to. I awoke perfectly - as though I'd merely blinked..

K: "LUNA!" I said, sticking my arms out. "Stop, stop! I'm awake, I'm fine."

Luna: "OH!" She hugged me from behind. "My.. My Ge- K, I.. I thought.." She stuttered. Very unlike her.

K: "I'm fine, I'm fine. Look, while I was out cold, something told me that we need to find the Rainbow of Light. Remember that! We MUST find it if we're to defeat Tirek." I insisted. Oh, I tried to stand, but she had her weight right over my shoulders. All I could do was hug her. "I'm FINE, honey. Really!"

Luna: "Don't.. scare us.. me.. like that.. ever.. please." She squeezed her forelegs around my neck tightly, then released me.

I stood up, finally, and ran like a madman over to the artillery position..

K: "COOOOOOOOSMIIIIIIIC! I WANT COUNTER-BATTERY FIRE! COORDINATE AND FIRE A-S-A-P! ALL POSSIBLE GUNS, EVERY IOTA OF SHELL, GET IT OUT THERE!"

Cosmic: "YES, GENERAL!" He turned to his staff. "PLOT ME A FIRING SOLUTION! SOMEONE GET A SIGHT ON THOSE ARCS! DEGREE AND DECLINATION! I WANT THEM TRACKED! GUN OFFICERS! ESTIMATE RANGE AND ELEVATION, EMERGENCY COUNTER-BATTERY FIRE, SHELL THOSE WOODS! I WANT SOME THROW WEIGHT OUT THERE!"

And then I ran to the airfield.

K: "WE'RE UNDER ATTACK! ALL WINGS, TAKE OFF IMMEDIATELY AND BOMB THEM BACK TO THE STONE AGE!" I pointed towards the woods. "GILDA! SPITFIRE! GUIDE THEM IN! AERO DART! I WANT THEM COVERED LIKE BLANKETS!"

Gilda: "YES, SIR!"

Spitfire: "RIGHT AWAY!"

Aero Dart: "ON IT, SIR!"

And then, as fast as I could, over to the front lines. Gaze wasn't back yet.. I was concerned. I dove for the nearest trench - Norfy's trench.

Norfy: "Seems like it's raining, General." He scowled.

K: "Yeah, raining purple bolts of death." I replied, pulling my Zhukov up from its sling. "Get the troops ready - pass the word. We may have to assault the forest with minimal preparatory bombardment."

Norfy: "On it, sir!"

I scrambled out of the trench, and ran as fast as I could back towards the artillery position.

K: "COSMIC!" I yelled, running towards the Artillery Command Position.

Cosmic: "YES, GENERAL!?"

K: "We're out of time! Load with Napalm Shell, execute preparatory bombardment of the general area the Artillery Fire is coming from! Forget precise C-B fire, BURN them out!"

Cosmic: "YES, SIR!" He turned to his staff. "FIRE MISSION CORRECTION - ALL GUNS LOAD NAPALM SHELL, EXECUTE BOMBARDMENT PLAN ONE-FIVE."

As they scrambled into action, I scrambled back towards the Headquarters Building. Dodging incoming fire as I did, I heard the rounds go out. Napalm. Fire. I was going to burn down the forest.. but it's not like Grogar gave me much of a choice..

As I went through the piles of maps and charts in the Headquarters building, I kept thinking of the conversation I had with Discord. He wasn't as evil as I thought - he wasn't evil at all, just chaotic. And he had given me the clue I needed to defeat Tirek, if not the exact tool. But I knew better than to think he was being entirely altrusitc - what was his angle in all of this? What was he really after? Was defeating Tirek that important to him, or was it something else? Did he really have "bouts of sanity" or was this all an act?

Part 2: From the Fold

TIME: 00:01 ERST
DATE: War Day 142
LOCATION: Ponyville

Gaze just came slamming through the barn door - the rear one. He was bloodied, he looked like he'd been stabbed. But he staggered over and dropped a large magical tome on the central map table.

Gaze: "Suh!" *Squeak*

K: "Fuck.. Gaze.." I grabbed him as he slid to the ground. "I NEED A MEDIC IN HERE, NOW!" I screamed, pulling him towards the door, applying direct pressure to his large knife(?) wound. "Gaze, who shanked you like this, buddy?"

Gaze: "Griffon. He.. he called himself.. Gorosbif.. he.. he said you killed his brother." He shook his head at me. "There were twenty of them, suh.."

K: "SWEETHART! GET OVER HERE!" I screamed. "Shit.." She was busy with a casualty of her own. So, I scooped him up and ran towards the field hospital. "Hang on buddy, you aren't going to die on me, understand?!" I said as I ran into the medical tent, and put him right in front of Dr. Well Wishes. "Save him." Was all I said, before running back towards the barn. "Fuck, fuck.. who's around.." I grabbed a Detrot Militia Pony as they were running by. "Get this book to the town Library immediately!" I shoved Gaze's book in the pony's saddlebags and pointed.

Luna: "My General!" *Ah!* A shell landed near her, but she dodged it deftly, throwing up a Lunar Curtain to protect herself from shell splash as she ran over to me. "What's going on!?"

K: "Gaze found something, but he was attacked by a gang of Griffons that said they know me.." I shrugged. "I'm pretty sure the Squad that went back with him are all dead - I can't imagine what he's been through, he literally looked like he'd been through a combine harvester. But he did find something - I sent a pony to the Library with it, maybe the girls can figure it out." I shrugged. "But that doesn't matter - we're going ahead with the bombardment. At least long enough to get them to stop shelling us."

I escorted Luna into the barn, and sat down on an old barrel. Artillery Bombardment is one hell of a way to damage enemy morale. Especially if you do it in such a way that continually keeps them on alert. Running hands through my hair, I tried to shake off the whole experience and get back on an even keel - this was a lot to go through my mind all at once.

Luna: "Are you alright?" She nudged me.

K: "I'll be fine." I said, getting up and going over to the sand table. "Alright.. we need a distraction.. something to make the enemy shut the hell up, other than fire bombing them - if he has more artillery, next time, he'll just park it farther away."

I studied the scale model of the battle area.. the lay of the land, the way the ridges were stacked. I nodded. I had a plan.

K: "I need the First Paratrooper Wing." I pointed to a ridge along the side of the forest. "I need them landed here, right along here. Have them push into the woods from here and pin Grogar's.. monsters down. And from there, they can call in more accurate artillery and air strikes."

Luna: "Are you sure?" She said, looking at the area I indicated.

K: "Best choice right now. It's either that or I make a frontal assault and go in completely unprepared." I shrugged. "That Artillery has to be silenced - they're the only solution we really have. Make the call."

Luna: "Yes, My General." She nodded.

K: "Once they land on the ridge, I want them to push into the forest and act as Forward Observers - as little Direct Action as they can get away with. Have them calling in Artillery and Air Strikes on any cluster of enemy troops they can find. And use High Explosives, not Napalm. I don't want a stray bomb or shell to incinerate them. I'm going to the Library.." I said as I stuffed the maps into Luna's saddlebags.

Luna: "Yes, My General." She galloped off - after all, the Barn had been 'abandoned' since it was so close to the shelling. They probably set up all the Comms Gear and such at Town Hall.

As for me, I ran for the Library. The shelling didn't reach very far towards town itself, so, after a bit, I was fairly safe. I went from a flat run to a jog.. urgent, but I wasn't about to break my neck, tripping on something. I took a moment to slow down and breathe.. Discord. He was still on my mind. His words.. his attitude.. everything. I was trying to pick out the words I could take as truth, and the ones that were lies. The Rainbow of Light, though, that was significant. I was certain he wasn't lying about that - that we would need it to defeat Tirek. Everything else, I didn't especially trust.

Oh, I believed that he loved Celestia once, and at least PART of the reason he wanted me here was to start a civil war between Luna and Celestia, or at least force Celestia off her throne (and cause immense Chaos by forcing Luna to handle the Day/Night Cycle, in as much as they ever did). That much, I also believed was true. But to do that, just to put her in a position where she'd have no choice but to go back to him? I wasn't sure about that. I also wasn't so certain he had this deep, unrequited love for her - at least, not that he STILL had it.

Did I trust Discord? No. Did I hate him? No, not anymore.

Did I have any other answers? No.

I checked my watch.


TIME: 00:14 ERST

What a day - I got to the Library and stepped in. Spike was guarding the door - lethal and cute all at once. He had an M1 style steel helmet on his head and he was holding my other Zhukov - well, his. I loaned it to him. Permanently. To top it off, he had a cute little faux Flak Vest I asked Rarity to make for him. I wasn't going to try for bullet resistance, but it looked nice. He looked like a little soldier straight out of Full Metal Jacket. I was half-tempted to get a proper cover for his lid and do Animal Mother's helmet markings, just as an in-joke that only I'd ever get.

Spike: "Girls are in the basement - Katrina, too." He saluted.

K: "Katrina?!" I was a little surprised at this.

Spike: "Well, Twi and Applejack kinda took her into protective custody, so..." He shrugged. "..that, and she wanted to help." He scratched the back of his head - and kept his finger OFF the trigger as he did it.

K: "Good Trigger Discipline, soldier." I tilted the brim of his helmet down a little, and set my Zhukov against the wall. "Keep guard, I'm going to check on the girls."

Spike: "Yes, General!" He snapped to attention, and started marching back and forth.. "Hut-one-two-three.."

I went down the stairs to the basement, and I had to do a triple-take - the basement was larger than the rest of the place. Confounded ponies and their deceptive construction practices! I'll bet Pinkie had a hand in this. Ah, well. I shrugged, brushed off my Field Jacket, and kept walking down the stairs, passing the in-wall rifle rack where the girls had their weapons stored. The door by it led to Twilight's "Science Room" - I guessed that's where she kept her testing equipment.

Twilight must've made some improvements on the place, to make it like her secret military command bunker or something. That girl - her nerdiness verged on neckbeard-grade, in that cute and adoreable way that would probably make a more jock-inclined man want her. Oh, I appreciated Twilight Sparkle - she was beautiful, and surprisngly warm and caring. But I was attracted to, and madly in love with, Applejack.

Still, I could understand how some Pony Fans would be attracted to her.

K: "Girls!" I called out.

Zecora: *Jersey Accent* "Back hea'h!"

Of course, they'd have to be all the way in the back of the basement. Moving through stacks and shelves of books and related materials - a few statues and other odd bits and things - I arrived at the rear area. There was a large area rug here, with benches set up, a desk, some small tables, and a few other knicknacks. It was like a reading nook.

Rarity: "Oh, my goodness, darling, you look positively thrashed!" She had half-moon glasses on, and was busy reading part of an ancient tome.

Applejack: "Hey, Honeybun." She gave me a look.

K: "Girls.. I need to be honest about something, but it can't leave this room." I said, taking a seat next to Applejack.

Fluttershy was half-asleep with Angel guarding her. NOW, he was in a Samurai getup. Still with the Bayonet. I was going to have to issue him his own at this rate. Pinkie was in the corner - no, sorry, Pinkamena was off in a corner, reading another book. She wasn't doing well, mentally, I could tell. I was honestly concerned she wouldn't snap out of it this time - and if she didn't, she wasn't the Element of Laughter. Thus the double-edged sword of Pinkamena - a sadistic psycho-killer on the tier of Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers, or a depressed sack. No joy. It worried me that she was able to slip so easily between personas...

Dash was buried nose-deep in a book - and when she looked up, she quickly whisked something off her face.

K: "...Dash, were those.. GLASSES?" I chided. I wanted to start this off on a high note.

Dash: "NO! Don't be SILLY! It's not like I can't read tiny words when they're less then a hoof away from my face or anything!!" *Nervous giggle* I could see the sweat pouring down her face.

K: "LIAR!" I playfully pounced her (actually, I just extended my body - she was that close) and nabbed them from her. Half-moons - exactly like Rarity's. "You borrowed Rarity's spares?"

Dash: "GIV'UM BACK!" She pounced me.

K: *AAH!* "I'm being attacked! Help me, my love!" *Laugh*

Applejack: "Mhm.." She flipped the page in her book, still reading. I knew she wore glasses for reading - I actually helped her pick out a large square-frame set to go with a kinky little outfit she liked to wear ("SmartyJack" she called herself - she'd use her Upper Class accent and pretended to be a college girl). "Y'all're'nt gettin' no help - y'all dug yer own grave there." She said, nonchalantly, pretending to ignore us.

Dash was quite strong - easily a good bit stronger than me, especially if she used her back muscles. And she did - she had me pinned in no time. Not that I really resisted much - I was laughing too hard to move my muscles properly.

K: "I surrender!" I laughed.

Dash: "Uh-huh! GIVE!" She demanded, pushing her snout into my nose.

I handed over the glasses.

Twilight: "Now, K, what's the big confession?"

K: "I talked to Discord." I said, still laying on the floor. "He's.. well, I better explain."

Katrina: "Oh, yes, my dear.. please, do. Discord isn't exactly high on my list of favourite persons, either."

She draped herself over the couch that Applejack was seated on, right next to her, and deliberately letting her breasts sway. She was dressed in a.. dress, now. A simple one, but it was clear Rarity at least sized it to her waist and bust. And it looked like she was going to make it up proper when we weren't getting shelled so hard.

K: "..before I get to that, tell me, what did you learn from Gaze's book?" I up-nodded to them.

Twilight: "..what book?" She looked at me, confused.

K: "The book I sent with the messenger - I grabbed a Detrot soldier." I shrugged. "He should have arrived here at least five minutes before me. I had him rush, I took my time a bit." I rolled to my knees. "You're telling me, no soldier from Detrot got here?"

Katrina: "No. You can ask the adoreable little Dragon - no one has been here." She shrugged.

K: "..oh, sweet fucking zombie Jesus.." I shook my head. "Goreham." Like, it just came to me.

Applejack: "The Griffon that tried to have his way wi' Gilda?!" She tossed her glasses onto the couch. "He's dead!"

K: "His brother isn't - Gorosbif." I shook my head. "What the hell.. he attacked Gaze, murdered the squad that went with him.. and I don't even know if Gaze is going to make it. He shanked him pretty good - and I don't even know how Gaze got back here." I shrugged. "Or why Gorosbif wants the book. Maybe Grogar hired him..?"

Gorosbif: "AN EXCELLENT GUESS, HUMAN SCUM!" He stood at the top of the stairs at the far side of the basement - holding Spike by his tail. Spike's face was battered and bruised. Gorosbif had one Zhukov, and a buddy of his had another.

And none of the girls even had their sidearms.

We were trapped in the basement with at least a dozen Griffons coming in the only door out, and I was the only one with a gun. They wanted us dead, it seemed. And they had a hostage.. and we had nothing but my PA-63.

Hostage situation.. what do you do?

My mind raced as I tried to think of a plan. Outnumbered, outgunned, and trapped.

Talk about a bad situation.

DATE: War Day 142
LOCATION: Twilight's Basement, Town Library, Ponyville

K: "What do you want, Gorosbif?" I said, flatly, standing up.

I crossed my arms as I looked at him evenly - I didn't make a move for my PA-63, that might've endangered Spike. They wanted something, or they would have just snuck in, grabbed the other guns, and started shooting.

Gorosbif: "You have something my client needs." He said, dangling Spike by his tail. "Deliver it to me and only one of you need die tonight."

K: "I'm guessing that's me, then?" I shrugged.

Gorosbif: "NO! Silly human. I seek the one named Derpy. She was the one that murdered by brother in cold blood." He snorted.

Twilight: "Derpy isn't even here! She's-"

Gorosbif: "YOU LIE!" He slapped Spike across the face. Hard enough that blood spurted from his nose.

Twilight: "SPIKE!"

K: "I wouldn't slap him around like that! He breathes FIRE, you know!" I pointed out, loudly.

I could see Spike's left eye open, just slightly..

K: "You keep hitting him, you'll burn yourself." I shrugged. "Fair warning - he IS a Dragon."

Gorosbif: "But a BABY! Feh! It wouldn't even give me a sun tan!" He gave a boastful grin.

Spike opened his mouth.. I could see his tongue wrap around one of his teeth.. then, belched fire, towards the ground.. the tooth was gone. Spike, you brave bastard - I knew I just had to stall him, now.

K: "Alright, Gorosbif.. what item do you seek?" I shrugged. "I'll trade you the item for your hostage - and give myself to you as a replacement." I made a slight hand gesture. "Surely, a Griffon of your size can handle one measly human with no magical power." He was easily a foot taller than me. Probably a couple hundred pounds heavier..

Gorosbif: "And YOU will take me to my brother's killer?" He snorted.

K: "Yes. You've already tangled with some ponies - my responsibility is to look after these here. I have no responsibility towards any of the others. Celestia gave me a very specific job.. and I'm guessing you were hired to do another very specific job. I'm sure you wouldn't want to assume more risk, more danger, than you have to.." I tilted my head, evenly, towards him.

Which is a good thing about Mercenaries. Their motivation is usually JUST the money - they'll do the job they're paid for, but unless there's a further bonus attached for additional mayhem, they're not likely to take any more risk than they absolutely have to...

Gorosbif: "An intelligent creature you are, Human." *Short sniff* "I can see why my brother spoke highly of your mind." He nodded. "No tricks - or the hostage - whomever they are - will die. Is that clear, human?"

K: "Crystal." I gave a tiny nod.

Applejack: "You cain't ser'usly be negotiain' wit' this varmit, izya!?" She layed into her accent.

K: "My job is to protect you - that's the job Celestia ordered me to do. It's my duty. Do you HONESTLY think I would abandon my Duty?" That was a little hint there..

Applejack: "So, yer jes' doin' yer duty, is that it!?" She huffed - she was a GREAT actress...

K: "Yes, Applejack. My duty. Nothing more." Twilight gave me a look, then nodded solemnly. "What's the item, Gorosbif?"

Gorosbif: "Done yammering? The item is actually two - a crystal pony skull and a book. It's an ancient tome, matches this one.."

He held up the book Gaze had brought back from Detrot. There was more blood on it than last time.. I can only guess they killed the messenger.

K: "Alright, but this will take a few minutes - they were going to study that very book. Twilight? Do you know offhand of any other matches to a book like that, down here?" I didn't look at her, I kept my eyes on Gorosbif.

Twilight: "No, but, I haven't been in this basement very often. There's hundreds of books here." She shrugged.

K: "Fortunately for you, there's eight of them to search.." The Girls, plus Katrina and Zecora.

Gorosbif: "I count nine of you." He narrowed his eyes slightly.

K: "Oh, I'm not going to help them - I'm going to stand right here and watch you, so you don't decide to use him as a punching bag or try to hurt them, and force me to act. He is under my protection as well, even if he is just a servant of the purple one here." I gave him a stern look. "You understand, my duty is paramount."

Gorosbif: "HAHA! Of course, human. Fine.. the eight of you get to work looking for the match to this book!" He huffed. "Immediately!"

K: "Go on, ponies. Look for the book." Gorosbif had just helped us immensely. And as long as I could keep him occupied, delayed...

The girls started searching.. haphazardly, but they made themselves look like they were being thorough - just enough to appease him. I stood there.. watching him, carefully.. my hand crossed under my arm, however, was resting on the butt of my PA-63. The second something happened, I'd be in a position to draw. Foolishly, the other Griffons didn't go to sieze the girls' guns. They were too pompus, too sure they'd won. They felt they didn't need the advantage...


TIME: 00:24

Gorosbif: "It's been nearly ten minutes!"

K: "There are hundreds of books here - most of them ancient. Do you want them to give you the wrong book?" I shrugged.

Gorosbif: *Grunt* "Fine. But hurry!"

K: "Oh, they're hurrying, Gorosbif.. they're hurrying.." Behind him, I could see a sparkle of light.. "I think they're just about done.." I looked at Twilight.

And back up to the stairs. A flicker of an astral rainbow mane...

K: "Twilight?" I said, turning to her.

Twilgiht: "Yes?"

K: "Check that pile over there - by the switch on the wall." I said with a huff. "It hasn't been searched yet."

Twilight: "R-Right.." She paced over to the pile - it was all children's books. She knew it, I knew it.

My grip on the butt of my PA-63 tightened ever so slightly..

K: "Twilight?"

Twilight: "Yes, now what?"

K: "THE LIGHTS!"

She gripped the switch in her teeth and pulled down HARD. The lights went completely out.

Gorosbif: "A TRICK!"

K: "CELESTIA! NOW! EVERYONE TAKE COVER!"

A giant beam of pure white light fired into the room. Not only did it blind the Griffons, it hit the one next to Gorosbif and sent him flying into the wall, knocking Gorosbif over, and forcing him to drop Spike. I drew my PA-63, and blind-fired towards the ones near the weapons rack, to keep them away from it, advancing rapidly as I did. Katrina summoned up a fireball and let it fly from the darkness - I saw it ignite one of the Griffons like a torch. He screamed, and fell to the ground.

Katrina: "VILE GRIFFONS! DID YOU FORGET THAT FELINAE CAN SEE IN THE DARK!?" I heard her yell.

She screamed, and I could hear a feline hiss and yowl, and claws tearing flesh. And a Griffon yelling in agony.

I ran for the weapons rack, I could hear Applejack behind me. Reaching the rack, I grabbed a Zhukov, and Applejack's Sagebrush Shotgun. I tossed it to her without looking, knelt at the edge of the stairs, and fired upwards, 9x18mm bullets stitching all along the wood.

Gorosbif: "RETREAT! RETREAT!" He screamed.

Taking flight, I could see them flow out of the door. I ran up the stairs after them, but I held my fire - I wasn't sure where Celestia was, and I didn't want to shoot her by accident. I got into the room just in time to see Celestia, IN HER BATH ROBE, duelling with one of Gorosbif's crew. She'd clipped his wing with a shot from her horn, and she had that sword again. She was trying to shank him, and he, using a large mace, was constantly parrying. I walked up as I was changing magazines..

K: "DROP IT!" I said, kneeling. Applejack was right there with her Sagebrush, right behind me.. "GIVE UP! NOW! YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!"

Griffon: "Eh.. ehhh.." He backed away.. holding his mace out defensively.

K: "DROP. YOUR. WEAPON." I ordered.

Griffon: "Ah!" He threw it to the ground, and put up his hands. "I GIVE!"

K: "Applejack, get some troops, I want him in custody." I pointed with the barrel of the Zhukov, to a small chair. "PINKIE! PARTY STREAMERS!"

Applejack: "On it, Honeybun!" And off she galloped.

Pinkie: "YAAAAAAAAAAAY!" She aimed an oversized Popper at him, whipping it out of nowhere, and rolling on her back, with the string in her teeth. "PARTY TIME!"

Griffon: "Wait-what!?"

*POP*

The streamers flew out of the oversized popper, hit him, and bound him up like a mummy. Her hair popped back out. Okay, so.. it doesn't take much? Whatever - Pinkie was Pinkie, and I gave her a hug.

Pinkie: *giggle* "Yer such a sweetie, K. Have a cupcake!" She stuffed it in my mouth. "I made them just for you!"

It.. tasted like meatloaf and the frosting, ranch dressing.. wait, MEATLOAF?

K: "Where.. did you get the..?"

Pinkie: "It's Turkey, lurkey!" *Giggle*

K: "Tasty.." I needed a snack after that. Shrugging, I saw Norfy come in the door with some Detrot Cavalry. "Norf! Good timing." Applejack was with them. I pointed at the captured Griffon. "Take him into custody. I want him secured, I have questions for him." I held up a cupcake from Pinkie's stash. "Care for a cupcake? Pinkie made 'em - they're nice and meaty."

Norfy: "N-N-NO!" He held up his hooves defensively. I didn't see it, but Pinkie willed her hair flat behind my back and was making stabby-stabby motions with a butcher's knife - trolling the shit out of him. "L-Let's get the prisoner! Come on, troops."

They scooped him up, and carried him out like trash. And I went over to Celestia.

K: "Excellent timing, Celestia. You got the tooth?" I nodded to her.

Celestia: *YAWN* "Yes, K. It took me a minute to figure out what it meant, but I got the message - honestly, I thought Spike had simply hurt himself, but, I wanted to check." She pulled her bath robe close to her. "I'm going back to bed now.." She said, nuzzling Twilight a little, and going over to Spike. "Right after I fix you up, little one."

Spike: *Groan* "Everything hurts.." He crawled out of the basement with Fluttershy's help. "..ow."

One bright beam of rainbow light later, and Spike was.. well, not fully healed, but feeling MUCH better. She even magically re-seated his tooth.

Celestia: "There." She stepped over to me, and looked up at me, putting a bare hoof on my hip. "K, please take this sword. It's older than I can remember, and it's obviously crafted for a human, not a pony. I pray it comes in handy for you." She gave me a smile - a sleepy smile, but a smile none the less.

Taking the sword from her back, I hefted it. It was about a "short sword" to me - below a meter in length, but shaped like a standard longsword. It had a wider base, and a slighlty broader tip, almost diamond-shaped. Hefting it, I found it perfectly balanced for human use. The crossguard was blue, with a few jewels inlaid across it, but metal, as was the rest of it. The handle was comfortable, and seemed to be wrapped in some kind of leather or suede. The sheath as well, and I affixed that to my belt, finding that it hung at an angle, pointed back. It was quite nice.

K: "Excellent." I nodded. "Thank you again, Princess."

Celestia: *Yawn* "Oh, no problem. Good night, my little ponies." She then vanished in a ball of light.

K: "Alrighty, then! Did anyone actually find the book that Gorosbif was talking about?" I shrugged.

Fluttershy: "Y-yes.. I did.." She pulled it out, along with the bloodied one.

Dash: "How did you get that?" She blinked.

Fluttershy: "I-I.. uhm.. s-stole it.." She murmured.

K: "No, you did the right thing." I went over to her and gave her a hug. I could feel her tense up at it.. she didn't want to really be touched right now, I could feel that. Something else I'd have to fix. "Alright, girls, let's get this cleaned up and start looking through the books. Gaze is hurt bad, so, he's not going to be any help. We need to find a solution, and fast."

I led them back down into the basement - this time, I collected our weapons and made sure they were right next to us.

Twilight: "I'm SO moving the weapons rack next to the Reading Nook." She muttered. "That is NOT going to happen again."

K: "God, the casualty list is going to be horrible. I haven't even read it yet - I just know the numbers." I shrugged. "Anyway.." Katrina then came up to me on all fours, planting a Griffon Wing at my feet. "..what's this?"

Katrina: "I've brought you presents.." She licked her right paw. "..murder presents."

K: "Kawaii as fuck." I said, sitting down. Only to have her curl up in my lap. "Katrina.. what are you doing?"

Katrina: "Why.. snuggling with you?" She looked up at me, rolled on her back, and gently pawed at my face.

Applejack: "MAH STALLION!" She huffed.

Katrina: "Your stallion, my saviour." She said, without looking away. "Besides, I already promised I'd share.. somewhat.." She gave me a teasing purr.

K: "Katrina, we're in a life-or-death situation.. are you seriously wanting to get kinky, now, and in public?" I blinked.

Katrina: *PURR* "Maybe.." She hefted her rear end around and waved her tail.

Fluttershy: "Ohhh, my.." She turned red and retreated behind the couch.

K: "Alright, look, later, okay? Focus, now. You and Zecora are the two best we've got." I looked at Twilgiht. "So far as experience goes."

Twilight: "Okay, you've got me there." She shrugged as we started looking through the two books.

After reading through them - I couldn't understand most of it - we discovered exactly what Gaze was talking about..

Zecora: "'Dis ain't a spell! Not a regular one, anyway! It needs a totem and spell components." She shrugged, and scratched her chin with her fetlock. "The materials ain't no thing - the stores in town oughtta have 'em.. but the skull is the big cheese hea'h.. no skull, no spell."

K: "Dash, Pinkie, Fluttershy, start looking around for the skull, would you? Gorosbif was convinced it was here." I shrugged. "Maybe it is."

Katrina: "Totem magic.. fascinating.. I haven't done that in ages." She was suddenly more interested in the book than my cock, and crawled off my lap to read the spell.

The bad thing was, she'd been rubbing up against me enough to give me a raging boner, purely out of physical stimulation. It took me a moment to get re-stituated right on the couch.

Katrina: "Problems, my dear?" *Purr*

K: "Nothing I can't handle." I coughed a bit.

Katrina: "Please, let me handle them.." She throatily teased.

Applejack: "MAH. STALLION!" *EVIL EYE*

K: *Twitch* "Enough, Katrina. The spell, please."

Katrina: "I could cast this." She shrugged. "It'll be a stretch without the Witchweed, but I'd rather not think about that right now. I should be able to focus enough magic - provided I have help from Unicorn Ponies - to channel enough power into the skull, to banish Grogar's necromantic influence on the Forest." She scratched her chin a little.

K: "So, all we really need is the Totem." I nodded to the book.

Dash: "GOT A PROBLEM!" She yelled.

So, we all got up and went over to where Dash was. She found the Totem in a chest among a collection of Relics. Problem? The Totem was in pieces. Hundreds of them. The only way we could even tell it WAS the Totem was the fact that it had a picture of the completed Totem right there in the box.

K: "Of all the-"

Katrina: "No, no, it's okay. We.. just need to put it together, is all." She scratched her chin.

Twilight: "That could take hours.." She frowned. "..I'll begin the calculations."

K: "Zecora? Take Rarity and Dash, go get the materials you need. Go armed, okay? I don't want to take the risk of more infiltrators running around town, or Gorosbif coming back."

Zecora: "On it." She picked up her Assegai, and as Rarity and Dash got their weapons, she gave Katrina a look. "We are filled with pride that you lend your loyalty to our side." She giggled a little - since she delivered that line in her Jersey accent. And away she went.

Hopefully, the Airborne Operation was proceeding smoothly. And that Rarity, Zecora and Dash could get their hands on the materials we needed. And.. that Twilight could manage to figure out how to assemble the damned Totem.. we were running out of options, and out of time.

Part 4: Wicked Child

TIME: 01:00 ERST
DATE: War Day 142
LOCATION: Ponyville Library


I paced back and forth like an expectant father. What more could I do? A messenger from the Balitmare Battery found me - the guns had been silenced for the moment, but they'd hit the Air Force Assembly Area, and in the process, blown several of the Napalm bomb racks. A calculated move, I was sure of it. They'd taken out about 30% of my napalm bombs, and caused a pretty nasty fire. And I'd expended about that same amount of bombs just trying to flush out and silence Grogar's artillery. So, I was down over half my stock, just to incinerate a very small area.

Basically, Grogar had pre-empted me, hit the storage area for the very ammunition that I was about to use to deprive him of both his forces, and his concealment, sent raiders to hit my rear area.. attempted a decapitation strike.. really, except for the rape thing, he was doing everything right. Actually, EVEN the rape thing - to disrupt enemy morale, get me to risk forces on a battle that essentially had no real purpose but to cost me resources.

The more I thought about it, the less this sounded like a mere necromantic Goat, and the more this sounded like someone that, by all rights, should be dead. This sounded like an up-scaled version of the Skirmish at Lone Hoof Ridge. This sounded like Trixie.

As much as my mind said this was impossible, I paced upstairs anyway - I'd had Luna move the operational headquarters to the Library. They were almost finished setting up..

K: "Luna!" I called for her.

Luna: "Yes, My General." She paced up with a nod.

K: "Raise the Paratroopers once they're in position. I have a side mission for them." I gestured.

Luna: "And that would be..?" She tilted her head.

K: "I need them to verify that Grogar - the big blue goat - is indeed in command here." I nodded slowly.

Luna: "I thought this was already a foregone conclusion, My General..." She tilted her head to the side.

K: "Oh, we know he's here. We know he's here. But is he in command? THAT, I'm not so sure of." I shrugged. "These tactics are feeling more and more like.." I looked at Harvest, Script and Mayor Mare.. "..like Trixie."

Mayor Mare: "Pardon me, K, I'm no soldier, but.. I thought she was dead?" She shrugged.

K: "Yes, Your Honor." I made a hand gesture, palm up. "But this feels like nothing more than an up-scaled Battle of Lone Hoof Ridge. It's the same basic situation. The enemy has forces it can afford to lose, we're stuck with our backs to a virtual wall - we obviously can't let them win here - and we're protecting something important. Last time, it was the Buffalo. This time, it's Ponyville. This feels like that battle, and moreover, it feels like whoever's directing this, has learned lessons from that battle." I paced over to the sand table as it was being set up. "Think about it - up until now, we've killed just about every enemy field commander we've engaged. Two exceptions - Katrina and Rep. Katrina's on our side, and honestly, Rep never had tactical control at Carousel Island. Gloom Mountain? It was us versus a semi-intelligent horde of undead. Hydia and her ilk, dead. First Ponyville? Trixie, and we killed her. Canternooga? The Raptorian General, they handled him VERY well. Essentially, we haven't really LEFT any enemy commanders alive to learn from their mistakes. But that's exactly what this feels like. Like someone knows our basic plans of attack, based on our level of technology, and they're using our limitations against us."

Luna: "If you're right, then, how is Trixie alive? We saw her dead." Luna asked as she sat on one of the sofas.

K: "My only guess? Hydia. She said she'd wasted her Necrooze on someone.. that she should have used it somewhere else instead, but she didn't. I'm beginning to suspect that she meant Trixie." I pointed.

Luna: "Could that Necrooze really bring someone back from the dead?" She tilted her head.

K: "I've been investigating that casually. Based on Captain Loconsole's War Journal. I found a case about 1500 years before your schism with your sister, recorded, that a pony was killed by some unknown assailants described as undead bugs. Then brought back." I rubbed my chin gently. "Norfy experienced it from the perspective of that pony - he thinks he was that pony, and given his track record, he might be right." I leaned on the sand table. "If he is, then, that prototype version of the Necrooze was able to restore life, but at a cost - it mutated the resurrected. Given twenty-five hundred years to work on it, is it impossible to assume that Hydia perfected some form of more solid resurrection?"

Luna: "I see your point. Shakey theory, though." She shrugged her wings.

K: "Well, it's either that, or Grogar is a military genius. And I'm not so sure of that." I looked at the positions on the sand table as they were beign set up. "..have the Air Force Assembly Area moved back to the other side of Ponyville." I pointed out. "And have the Artillery moved here." I pointed to the northern side of Ponyville - the farthest point from the forest. "Also, I want our positions re-consolidated. Pull the Cavalry back into town, have the Infantry shifted around by unit flag.. cohesive units only. No piecemeal stuff. Tell the individual unit commanders to get everyone sorted by their city of origin instead of mixed and ready to charge according to the initial plan."

Luna: "Reason, My General?" She tilted her head a little towards me.

K: "Because this is exactly what I wouldn't do. Set up for a siege. If this is Trixie, she'll expect me to have everyone ready to attack, and have my artillery in position to fire as deep into the woods as possible, and the Air Force to have the shortest possible turn-around time. To save their wings, and to decrease the time between strikes." I pointed to the map table, tapping my finger on it.

Luna: "So, you're treating this as though your theory is correct..?" She cocked a brow.

K: "Yeah. Even if I'm wrong, we'll be hardened against another shelling, and with the Cavalry units ready to plug breaches in the lines, hardened against another frontal assault." I leaned back and scratched my chin. I was getting stubble..

Luna: "Understood." She nodded, and nodded to the communications team.

I went back downstairs, pacing over to the little 'nook' at the rear of the basement. I plopped down on the sofa, and watched as Twilight was furiously writing on sheets of paper some advanced mathematical calculations - she had a near-complete sketch of the skull hanging off to one side, held there by her unicorn magic.

K: "Report..?" I asked quietly, to no one in particular.

Applejack: "Twi's nearly got it. But take a look at this, huh?" She slid over Gaze's book.

I read it for a few minutes.. it covered Tirek, interestingly enough. There were some rubbings of old stone carvings in here, that had been traced over and re-drawn for the book. And guess what? Tirek was featured prominently in several of the carvings. In one, he stood by a jet-black oversized unicorn pony. In another, he stood by a fascinating-looking structure that I'd never seen before. And in another.. and this I recognizied.. he was standing by what could only be Chrysalis and a Changeling.

Now, I wasn't about to panic anyone. For all I knew, this was a coincidence - the illustrations didn't have full-length explanations on them, just annotations of what was literally in the scene - "Tirek by Structure" - "Tirek by Black Horse" - "Tirek by Bugs" and so on. Some of them were totally benign, like Tirek standing before some Raptorians, or Tirek standing above some corpses of things that looked similar to him. It made me wonder, though - was this how Tirek became the leader of this supposed empire of his? By killing everyone weaker than him?

Some of the illustrations were disturbing, too. Like Tirek standing above a ruined land of some kind. And Tirek standing on clouds.. though he had no wings. Then there was what I expected - three humans defeating him. It didn't seem to go any further than that, and that worried me. Something had released Tirek from wherever he was, and in so doing, let him loose with all this power and an apparent desire to crush Equestria. Even though none of the ponies here, had anything to do with Tirek's defeat.

K: "Hm." Was about all I said.

I wasn't concerned. Well, I was, but it had nothing to do with our current situation. I'd have to ask Cadence about some of this - especially what looked like a black unicorn pony, unlike anything I'd ever seen before.

K: "How's it coming, Twilight?" I up-nodded to her.

Twilight: "I'm almost done.." She said, turning, finally, to the crystal skull itself.

I was then reminded of both the Jewel Wizard and Crystal Ponies.. looking at the completed drawing of the skull that Twilight had made. The Jewel Wizard was obsessed with stuff like this, at least, he had been before we'd killed him.

I watched as Twilight levitated the Crystal Skull and snapped the pieces into place, one at a time, in rapid succession. Once it was done assembling, I gave an approving nod.

Yet, once again, I was reminded of Crystal Ponies. It was the way the fake eyes were shaped, like cut gemstones, not like fake normal irises or something.

K: "All we need now-"

Zecora: "Got the mats!" She announced, galloping over to wher we were. "Got everything on the list." She nodded. "Now, stand back, an' let us mix it up, yeah?"

Katrina: "Fantastic.. ah! And in such good quality, too.." She purred.

She started picking through the materials, pulling over a small cauldron and lighting a fire under it with her magic. She set the fire-attached-to-the-cauldron in a little crevice in the wall, on a hook. Together, they began mixing everything.

K: "How many Unicorn ponies are you going to need?" I asked, knowing I'd have to make special preparations for that.

Katrina: "At least twenty. All powerful magic users." She nodded as she and Zecora added the ingredients one at a time.

K: "Pinkie? Let Luna know what we need." I pointed to her.

Pinkie: "Got it!" And off she scooted.


TIME: 01:25 ERST

We were far behind schedule. Right now, the forest should be completely in flames and Grogar should be running for his life. Instead, we were stuck relying on something that may or may not work. I just hoped it would - or we'd be in a very tight spot. It could be hours before I could mix up enough new napalm to plaster the woods effectively.

We just hoped it wouldn't come to that.

Norfy: "..are you sure I should be here, K?" He asked me, concerned, as the Unicorns were assembling.

K: "Norf, you're the most skilled Ice Mage I know of. You're strong, no two ways about it, and that's what we need right now. Powerful magic." I nodded to him, confidently.

Norfy: "If you say so, General." He shrugged.

I gave him a one-arm hug - my other arm was hefting my Zhukov - and patted him on the head a little.

K: "Norfy? I'm positive. Now get out there and give it your all!" I cheered him on.

Norfy: "Well, I suppose I'll have to, now." He said, trotting out to the circle.

I watched as the Unicorns I'd pulled from the lines assembled. All different units - Royal Army, Navy, Marines, Guards, Militia.. I shook my head with a bit of pride. Friendship really was a powerful thing here. Katrina was making the final preparations.

Katrina: "Alright, I'll begin the incantation. When I reach the third phrase, as marked on your sheets, start chanelling all the power you can, into the crystal skull. Every drop."

Luna: "Are we certain this will work?"

Katrina: "I have no idea! But it'll be an impressive show, either way." She shrugged. "If it does work, everything Grogar animated in that forest, will drop dead. Or, rather, the magic will be completely dispelled. That's what this does - it dispels magic."

K: "Like Radio did.." I muttered. "..hang on, Katrina. I have an idea." I spoke, as I ran off towards the Clinic. "Don't start until I get back!" I yelled behind me as I ran.

The Clinic wasn't that far away, thankfully. And when I got there, I ran right for Radio's room. Bursting in the door, I'd caught her asleep. Throwing her a spare uniform shirt that Dawn had apparently brought her, I rousted her from her slumber.

K: "Radio! We need you!"

Radio: "Me..?" She asked, almost like it was a joke.

K: "Yes! We're about to cast an incantation of magic dispelling. It's supposed to be a super-powered version of what you did earlier, it should eradicate all the stuff in the forest, leaving Grogar wide open." I made a hand gesture. "I have a feeling that if you're there, the spell will be that much stronger."

Radio: "I don't even know if I have any juice left in me.." She rolled her head to the side. "..but if it means saving lives, I'll try." She pulled herself from her bed, with a groan. I had to help her get her shirt on. "My ponies.. my troops.. I'm still.." She looked at her shoulder board. "I'm still responsible for them." She looked at me, little slivers of tears forming in her eyes. "If this kills me.. do me a favor?"

K: "This won't kill you." I reassured her.

Radio: "No, listen to me. If this kills me, please, make sure Norfy knows that.. what we did.. I.. I really do love him." She said as I buttoned the middle two buttons on her spare shirt. It barely fit, with the bandages there, covering the sores where her wings usd to be. "We.." She shook her head. "Never mind."

K: "Right. You tell him yourself." I said, as I led her out to the field.

It was a short-ish walk, but we got there alright. She was able to make the march unassisted. The other unicorns gave uneasy looks - all but Norfy. His eyes lit up when he saw her.

Katrina: "OH! K, good thinking! Right, right.. Radio, is it?"

Radio: "Radio Active. Yes." She said, blushing a little at Norfy's enthuseastic hoof-patting on the ground.

Katrina: "Whatever's inside of you is very similar to what this does. Stand under the Crystal Skull - and when they start channeling their magic into it, do what you can to channel whatever's inside of you, into it as well." She nodded.

Radio: "And this'll dispel what Grogar did?" She tilted her head, just a bit.

Katrina: "We're hoping." She shrugged. "We're all really, really hoping."

Radio: "Alright." She looked at Norfy with a small smile as she went and stood under the Crystal Skull.

It took Katrina a bit to begin the incantation, but when she did, the entire field seemed to light up with power. I stood further back, watching this all take place. The eyes on all the Unicorn Ponies glowed a bright white, and seemed to light up the night like small stars. Their power flowed into the crystal skull in gentle waves, culminating in a gently throbbing white-green pillar. When it connected with Radio, the energy seemed to gain focus. Radio and the skull floated up into the air.. and with a brillant flash, waves of this milky-mint energy cascaded over everything.. it flowed to the woods, beyond it.. everywhere.

One last brilant burst of light, and it was over. Radio collapsed, panting, exhausted. The other Unicorn ponies slumped a little. Norfy forced himself over to where Radio was, and in a final defiant act against his exhausted body, only let himself slump over, when his neck was over hers.

I watched them.. they were both smiling.

Even I was smiling.

K: "Applejack!" I called.

Applejack: "Yeah, honeybun?" She asked, as she trotted up.

K: "Get to HQ, get on the horn with the Paratroopers - I want to know if this worked or not. Go now!" I shoo'ed.

Applejack: "On it!" And off she ran.

Me? I stayed there and helped the medics clean up the exhausted ponies. I personally helped Luna to her hooves, as well as Norfy and Radio. The other ponies from the Clinic and the Field Hospital unit helped the others. We got them over to the side, and started pumping tea and food into them. They all ate voraciously - apparently, lots of magic means lots of calories.

Dr. Well Wishes: "I hope this worked." He said, looking me right in the eye.

K: "Me, too, Doc." I said, as I held on to Luna.

Luna: "I could really use coffee right about now.."

K: "Coffee?! I haven't had any since I got here - I didn't even think you ponies knew what it was!" I said, almost exasperated.

Luna: "Of course! Just.. most don't like it very much, so it's not served in very many places. I have to have mine grown at the palace.." She looked at me as if to say 'why didn't you just ask?'

K: "..now I want coffee." I frowned, with a little pouty-face. Luna kissed my cheek.

Luna: "Next time you're at the palace, I'll see to it that you get all the coffee you can drink." She smiled a little.

K: "I drink about half a gallon a day." I smirked.

Luna: "Oh, my! I'll finally be able to get through all of that extra stock, at that rate.." She rubbed her chin with her fetlock as she levitated a sandwich to her mouth.

Applejack came running up with the other girls, smiling a mile wide.

Applejack: "K! IT WORKED! NOTHIN' IN THAT FOREST IS MOVIN' THAT SHOULDN'T BE!" She squealed.

I stood up, and nodded, grabbing my Zhukov.

K: "Assemble the troops - we're going in."

We'd find Grogar - and Trixie if she was there - and put an end to this battle, once and for all.

Part 5: Lamenting Innocence

TIME: 23:30 ERST
DATE: War Day 141
LOCATION: Edge of the Forest

I was there with what was left of the 1st Royal Rangers. A platoon-sized fire team: Big Mac in the lead, with Graphite, Nurse Redheart, Sunshine Smile, Lawn Dart, and Cloud Kicker in First Squad, then Octavia, Scratch, Nurse Sweetheart, Lyra, Bon-Bon and Braeburn in Second Squad. This wasn't their normal formation, but everyone else was injured.

Yes, out of the entire unit, this was all I had to work with. Including Cheerilee.

Oh, was Mac pissed off.

Mac: "We gonna kill him?" He asked in a low voice as we advanced into the woods.

K: "Probably. Eventually. Depends if he's in charge here or not. I need answers." I shrugged.

Octavia: "Focus, Mac. Our first objective is to find the Paratroopers." She reminded him.

Mac: "Eeyup." *SNORT* "C'mon. My head's clear. Promise."

K: "You sure, bro?" I patted his shoulder. "No shame in admitting you've got an axe to grind here." I thought of Fluttershy.

Mac: "Eeyup. Just fine. Now let's do the job."

We advanced in L-Diamond formation - pointman out front, the rest of the squad trailing in pairs in a rough diamond shape, with the second squad behind us and off to one side, same grouping. The girls were behind 2nd Squad, with Luna and her personal guards.

It was a bit of a relief to have Luna there - she was (I hoped) at least as powerful as Grogar, and unless Trixie got herself a serious upgrade, Luna would trash her.

K: "No contact so far. I see the Skull did its trick." I scratched my upper lip with the side of my right index finger. "Mac, have the ponies fan out more - I want contact with the Marines."

Mac: "Eeyup. Rangers! Stagger Line Formation!" He held out his right foreleg, and the ponies spread out more.

Stagger Line formation spreads everyone out by pairs, and keeps the pairs from lining straight up, and at a rough distance of about 5-10 meters apart. I wanted to make sure we could link up with Captain Spirit's Marines, just in case.

That and if anything was still in these woods, we'd find it, and form a barrier between it and the girls.

As we marched along, I raised a fist for 1st Squad to halt. I'd spotted a burrow of some kind.

K: "Someone check that tunnel. I don't want that behind us if there's anything in there."

Mac: "Eeyup.." He looked at his Ponies. "Graphite." He nodded to the tunnel.

Graphite: "Yes, sir." He got down on his hooves and knees, passing his Sherman to Mac as he pulled his Lee out and crawled into the hole.

K: "Comms." I motioned for Scratch. Natural she'd be in charge of communication gear, isn't it?

Scratch: "Right." She came over and took a knee next to me as I grabbed the radio receiver.

K: C> "Alpha Leader Actual to Mike India."

Sgt. Sigmask: C> "Mike India, go ahead. Over."

K: C> "Status report, Mike India. Over." I called calmly.

Sgt. Sigmask: C> "Objective area is peaceful as a tomb, Alpha Leader. Nothing out here. Over."

K: C> "Roger that, Mike India. Continue operation. Make sure you check any tunnels, burrows or animal hutches, over."

Sgt. Sigmask: C> "Roger that. Additional? Over."

K: C> "Negative. No additional orders. Alpha Leader out."

Sgt. Sigmask: C> "Mike India, nominal."

I shrugged as I set the receiver back.

K: "Nothing. Woods are quiet for them, too." I looked at the hole. "Clear in there, Graphite?"

Graphite: "AAH!"

Everyone had weapons raised, aimed right at the hole. Mac loaded a buckshot shell into his Knox.

The.. Graphite came tearing out of the hole with bunnies all over him. BUNNIES.

K: "HOLD FIRE! HOLD FIRE! Graphite, what the heck!?"

Graphite: "GIT'EM OFF! GIT'EM OFF!" *Laughter* "IT TICKLES!"

K: "What..?" I looked back towards our rear. "FLUTTERSHY! GET UP HERE!"

By this time, Graphite was on the ground, laughing his ass off. Bunnies! A minute later, Fluttershy came flying up. She landed next to Graphite and grabbed one of the bunnies gently by the nap of its neck and lifted it up.

Fluttershy: "Now, now. Mister Graphite was just making sure you're alright. There's no need to attack him. There's a very bad thing out in the forest, and we're here to protect you."

Graphite: "I-I-Is that what they're doing?!" *BAHAHAH* "IT TICKLES!"

Fluttershy: "They thought you were after their carrots.." She pet the bunny on the head and let it go.

The bunny whistled to its compatriots and back in the burrow they all went. One of the little ones bounced right off Graphite's nose as he swan-dived into the burrow.

K: "Are you okay, Graph?"

Graphite: *Haha* "I'm fine! That tickled!" He got up and dusted himself off, taking his Sherman back and hosltering his Lee. "Thanks, Fluttershy."

Fluttershy: *hmm!* She smiled a little and took off to rejoin the girls.

K: "That.. was weird." I shrugged. "Alright - exercise all caution when checking... bunny holes, I guess."

We advanced into the woods.. deeper and deeper. First Royal Rangers ended up near the path that would lead towards the ruined Ancient Castle. It wasn't that far from the ridge line, or Steve the River Dragon's grave by the riverside. We were deep in the thick, and I navigated us towards the main path that we'd taken for Operation: Royal Oak. If the Paratroopers had moved ahead, this was likely the direction they would have taken.

????> "Flash." I felt a Mitchell pressed to my back.

K: "Thunder." Our sign/countersign. "Very good."

The Paratroopers melted out of the foliage - and they'd done a very good job of hiding. The positions they came out of, would have had us all caught in a crossfire if we were unfriendly.

K: "Report." I looked for the one with silver on their shoulder boards.

Lt. Weaver: "Lieutenant Webley Weaver, General K. 3rd Paratrooper Wing, Paratrooper Command." She was a Pegasus.

Interesting, since most Paratroopers were Unicorn or Earth Ponies.

K: "I haven't met you, yet." I looked at the unit. "But I see you've done a fantastic job training these ponies."

They all wore camouflage - a variant of a pattern that Rarity made, looked a lot like US Woodland Camo from the 1980's - and as they got into a guarding position, they did so silently. Most of them had Zhukov SMG's or Mitchell Carbines, though a few had Sniper Shermans. Paratroopers were designed from the start to be light, mobile forces. No heavy or crew-served weapons to slow them down. They were more than just air mobile infantry, they were a light strike force that could jump behind enemy lines. The method of deployment was interesting - a wing of Pegasus from a Transport Command unit would fly them over the area, loaded with gear, and simply drop them from about 500 feet up, with a parachute.

I had no idea why Parachutes had even been developed here, but they had.

Either way, they had their shit together.

Lt. Weaver: "Thank you, General." She nodded at me. "To report, sir, Grogar was indeed spotted. And as you suspected, we caught him talking to a blue unicorn pony. But this was at a distance, and.." She shook her head. "..while she was blue, I can't and wouldn't swear that it was Trixie. I couldn't see her cutie mark, nor could we tell if she was wearing a cape and pointed hat."

K: "Very good. Where did you see them?" I asked, looking around for the main trail.

Lt. Weaver: "Oh.. over by Dream Castle."

K: "THAT'S what it was called!" I slapped my forehead. "I KNEW IT!"

Lt. Weaver: "Uh-yeah."

K: "Wait.. how did you know that?"

Lt. Weaver: "Oh.. I-uhm.." She suddenly looked very uncomfortable. "I just.."

K: "Ah." I nodded to Mac. "Advance to the River. It should be about fifty meters from here. Set up covering positions. Nothing crosses that isn't one of us."

Mac: "Eeyup." He looked at Weaver, and gave her a nod, before leading the rest of the unit to the River.

I waited. Not just for the Rangers and Paratroopers to leave, but for Luna and the Girls to pass us. Once they were all out of ear shot, I looked at Weaver.

K: "Alright, you. Out with it." I said, sternly.

Lt. Weaver: "IgottheinformationfromylittlewikiwhichisawebsitebutIhadnoideawhatawebsitewasuntilIgotmycutiemarkandI'vehadthesevoicesinmyheadeversinceandIthoughtIwascrazyyouknow? *Two-beat Pause* "ThenIheardaboutyouandthatyouwerehumansandthatyoucamefromanotherworldandthatyouHADtobethesolutiontowhateverwasgoingonwithmesoIjoinedtheparatrooperssoIcouldmaybemakeRangerandonedaymeetyouinperson!" *Gasp*Pant*

K: "Breathe, Lieutenant. It's healthy for you." I gave a little chortle and patted her on the back.

Lt. Weaver: "Is.. the internet real, General?"

K: "Yes." I shrugged. "I can't imagine some of the things you must have seen because of it. I'm very sorry. There's some sick people in my world."

Lt. Weaver: "Oh.. well, it's not like I can control it.. I just.. get these little infrences every now and then, or an article read out loud to me, or something. I get stuff from a place called Four Chan a lot.."

K: "Mother of God.." I bowed my head.

Lt. Weaver: "I-I deal with it. My parents thought I was crazy, and didn't want anything to do with me. So.. really, joining the military was my last chance." She shrugged.

K: "Let me guess.. you already had an idea what training was going to be like?" I nodded to her.

Lt. Weaver: "Well, I'm not exactly a basement-dwelling neckbeard, General. I'm just glad you didn't tiger-stripe the weapons.." She looked at her Mitchell. "..you know, for the longet time, I called these things 'Nuggets'? And I'd actually say 'PING' to myself when I changed clips.. NO! Mags! Mags. Never clips. Never clips."

K: "I.. wow." I gave her a little hug around the neck. "You poor, messed up pony. No one should have to go through that." *Ahem* "You.. you know what the Cupcakes story is?"

Lt. Weaver: *Blush* "Yes.. I.. I can't bring myself to talk to Miss Pie.. I-I mean, I know she's one of your Adjutants, but.." She blushed.

K: "Okay. Never tell Captain Norfy Loconsole about it. Ever. Understand? He had a dream about it. And it disturbed him." I nodded to her.

Lt. Weaver: "R-Right." She looked at the ground. "I have so many questions.."

K: "I'm just sorry that your contact with humanity had to be through the Internet." I shrugged. "And worst of all, 4Chan. It's not a nice place. I'm actually rather surprised that you didn't have the urge to shoot me, with all the bad impressions of humanity that the Internet must have given you."

Lt. Weaver: "NO! Of course not! No, no, I find it all fascinating, if disturbing. Uh.. do.. humans really burn Filly Feelers at the stake?" She tilted her head. "Or is that-"

K: "We'll go through everything we can at a later date." I patted her on the head. "For now, we have a battle to fight."

Lt. Weaver: "Yes, General." She nodded.

We advanced to the river. And there, we saw our next obstacle.. oh, dear. A huge purple energy field was right there in the middle of the river. It was the same color as the projectiles the "Artillery" had been firing. And I could tell just by the way Luna was looking at it, that it had nothing to do with Grogar.

K: "This is Trixie, isn't it?"

Luna: "Yes, I'm afraid so. I know where she learned the spell, too. But she shouldn't have this level of power - this is the sort of power you'd see from an Alicorn." She looked a bit frightened.

K: "Are you saying Trixie was turned into an Alicorn?" I asked, stunned.

Luna: "It is either that, or she has gained power at least equal to mine." Luna shrugged. "If we breach that barrier, she will know."

K: "How much time do you need? I'm pretty sure we won't be able to capture her, but perhaps we can get Grogar.." I crossed my arms. "I don't think she'll try to take him with. She might.." I shrugged. "There's no way under or over?"

Luna: "No. The barrier would adjust to fit." She shrugged. "The only way is to breach it. I would need at least an hour to safely run through all the possible counter spells and energy types." *Snort* "I can't imagine how Trixie would get this level of power.."

K: "Probably.." I looked at Twilight. "..she did it for revenge.."

Twilight lowered her head.

I couldn't begin to imagine what Twilight was feeling. Right now, she had her greatest enemy on the other side of the river, and that enemy had gained power near to that of her own teacher. Her Royal Sovereign. Even Luna was taken aback by this level of power. I wasn't even sure if we'd be able to get through this... for once, science was completely stumped!

Once we got through, though, it wouldn't be very far to the castle. And if they were still there, it would be the last time we would fight any of them. I would make sure of it.
