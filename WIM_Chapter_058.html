Kaltbluter, shockingly, was the very first to react. Before I realized what was happening, he drew his naval cutlass and slammed it into the table with all his might. Given that he's as big and buff as Mac, and more experienced, he basically cleaved a chunk out of it.

It BLED.

Celestia: "WHAT IN THE STARS?!" She and Luna jumped back, as I yanked my Morgan free of its hip holster.

Blueblood drew his own sabre, and offered Rarity his High Power, which she accepted, having not bothered to take a gun with her.

Rarity: "GUARDS!" She covered Celestia immediately.

K: "KILL IT! WHATEVER IT IS, KILL IT!" I raised my Morgan, as the table shape-shifted into a Cerberus.

Kaltbluter: "IST EINE IMITATOR!" He said through grit teeth, his mouth around his sabre.

The Marines came in, with Blinda in the lead.

K: "It's a MIMIC!" I pointed. "SHOOT THE DAMN THING!"

One Marine hefted his rifle to Kaltbluter, while Blueblood and Rarity got out the back door with the princesses.

Kaltbluter: "Verdamme dich zur H”lle, du widerliches Biest!!" He opened fire about the same time everyone else did.

The Cerberus-mimic started bleeding severely from its wounds, but it fell back to the far side of the room, demorphing its shape into something else. Liquid, at first, then it became a Manticore.

Kaltbluter: "General! Follow mein lead!" He seems to know what he's doing..

He whipped his bicorne hat off, and revealed his horn. He was a unicorn. He immediately blasted the Mimic with a spell, which seemed to reverborate around it, and the Mimic got instantly very frustrated.

Kaltbluter: "IT HEALS WHEN IT CHANGES FORM! I have FROZEN it! Now, it can die!" He raised the rifle and dumped the rest of the magazine into it.

The Marines behind him, and myself, all did the same thing. The Manticore shuddered and barely stood up under the hail of gunfire. Still shocking me, Kaltbluter retrieved his cutlass as we were reloading, charged the monster, and buried the cutlass up to its hilt in the monster's chest.

It bellowed, and tried to swipe at him. He just fired a short magic bolt and knocked it back.

Kaltbluter: "ZERE!" He snorted, pacing back, but still facing it.

K: "Give it another mag, everyone, just to be sure!" I raised my reloaded Morgan, and everyone fired, saturating the monster with even more hot lead.

It screamed as it died, with Blinda holding her arm up to cease fire.

Blinda: "Think we got it, sirs." She turned to Kaltbluter. "Uhm.. Vice Admiral Kaltbluter. That was-"

Kaltbluter: "Vhat any son of Germaneigh shoult be prepared to do." He said, fixing his uniform perfectly, and going over and picking up his bicorne, which he carefully fixed to his head. "Very vell commanded.. Fraulein Major." A curt head-nod of respect.

Blinda: "Huh. You alright, K?" She looked over to me.

K: "Not a scratch - thanks to the Admiral." I nodded. "That thing was either spying on us this whole time, or it was sent to assassinate everyone it could."

Kaltbluter: "Espionage." He nodded firmly. "Zey are not.. predictable in battle." He huffed a bit, with a small chuckle. "I admit that at 62 years, I am a bit old for zis.. zis.." He dismissively waved a hoof at his fallen foe. "..rabble-rousing." And smirked a very, very Prussian-German smirk of disrespect at it.

Blinda: "Wow.. I'm only 26. I hope I'm half as tough when I'm your age, Admiral." She bowed in respect as Toola Roola came in.

Toola: "HOLY HORSEFEATHERS!" She had her Ridgway.. yeah.. and the rest of the girls were with her.

K: "Blinda, clean up this mess. Toola, get a good look at it - I want a painting of Admiral Kaltbluter standing over his defeated foe." I shrugged. "We just helped."

Kaltbluter: "Nein, nein.." He humbly waved his hooves. "..I would have been sunk vithout you." He gave me a rather cheeky grin for an old man.

K: "Either way." I shrugged. "Shall we retire to the foyer? Admiral? I'm wagering a good Germane like yourself would like a spot of cider after that." I nodded. "Or Schnapps."

Kaltbluter: "Cider." He gave a short chuckle. "Zee Schanpps is only ven I am around ponies I have to pretend to respekt."

So, we retired to the foyer of the headquarters building, to complete our meeting. Kaltbluter had a couple of hard ciders, and did prove himself very much Germane, keeping a perfectly level head the whole time. Meanwhile, Toola? Was indeed painting the good Admiral standing over his defeated foe.

As I understood later, his wife loved it.

Part 2: Fleet Review

TIME: 10:11 ERDT
DATE: War Day 553/12 Decemus, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Fillydelphia Naval Yards, Fillydelphia, Docksylvania

I was reviewing our NEIGHTO combined fleet. It struck me how different and distinct the designs were, how each nation had approached shipbuilding and naval strategy, based on my guidelines.

The ships themselves looked horribly kitbashed from 1880's to early 1930's design and asthetic principles and pieces. The Germane ships all VERY closely resembled each other, and only because they were different lengths, was I able to tell the difference.

I needed to know the relative strengths and weaknesses of each fleet. While the individual admirals would have direct command of their nations' own task forces, I needed to know how best to use each piece on the chess board. The Neighpon Campaign, it seemed, would indeed be my blueprint for the eventual invasion of Tirek's lands, right down to knowing how each NEIGHTO nation best operated. Tirek already demonstrated he had naval forces to match my own, even if the technology levels were questionably fluid between the 1600's on the lowest end, to the early 1900's on the high end.

I began with the Germane task force built around Thuringia. The Battleship Thuringia was a squat, thick looking vessel sporting main turrets in a diamond formation - that is, a main turret fore and aft, with main guns in the center, but towards the port and starboard edges of the deck, allowing them to fire fore and aft as well. It also had a lot of casemate guns, and a clear casemate gun deck, set back from the main hull line, giving it excellent useability even in very rough seas.

The Bomst-class armored cruisers were almost identical, save shorter, and with one more main gun turret for a total of five. The Hamover-class Scout Cruiser was the same basic silhouette as the Thuringia and Bomst-classes, but with clearly lighter guns.

K: "What caliber are those guns?" I pointed at the Thuringia 's main guns.

Kaltbluter: "24 centimeter.." He nodded. "Qvick-fire, one piece ammunition, hydraulic assisted loader vith automated breach."

K: "And the Armored Cruiser?"

Kaltbluter: "21 centimeter." A point at the Gotha. "Same teknology, General."

K: "They're almost the same caliber. That's not much difference. And the Battleship's main gun is awfully light." I shrugged.

Kaltbluter: "Ja. But, zee ships are very heavily armored. Zee Thuringia is double-proofed." He nodded. "Our ship designers decided zat heavy, thick armor would be zee best means to project our power, by remaining in zee fight longer."

"Double Proofed" meant the Thuringia could withstand a shell hit from a caliber as high as 420mm, or 16.5-inch armor piercing shells. For a ship to be "proofed," that means it can withstand a hit from its own main guns without significant damage or penetration of the armor belt. Double proofed is incredibly rare as it requires a lot of very thick armor.

K: "You mean at the armor belt.." I led on.

Kaltbluter: "Armor belt, citadel, conning tower, turrets, barbettes." He nodded, with a grin.

K: "Speed?" I asked.

Kaltbluter: "Maximum 24.6 knots." He shrugged. "Zee engine space ist fairly small.."

K: "So, lighter hitting, damage-soaking, slow." I nodded. "Deployment?"

Kaltbluter: "Zee battleship leads zee companion Armored Cruiser. Zee Scout Cruiser spots for zee battleship, zee battleship leads and attracts enemy fire."

K: "Gun ranges?"

Kaltbluter: "15,000 meters, vith minimal dispersion. Our very high powered optics and rangefinders heff a nearly 50% hit rate in practice." He smirked.

K: "Holy smokes!" I was blown away.

Ordinarily, Naval Gunfire for this technologial era (1870 - 1920) in combat has a less than 20% hit rate, even with the best of crews. Many, many variables go into how this is affected, but optics and accurate rangefinders are among them. With his stated hit rate, that meant the ship could count on one shell from each fired turret to likely hit.

Kaltbluter: "Shtate secret.. vee use a mechanical computation device to range and lay the guns." He gave me a wicked grin.

K: "You have a Fire Control Computer!" I was stunned - a Pony ally came up with this all on their own! Not even the Equestrian fleet had those, yet. "So, high damage resistance, moderate range, high accuracy are your fleet's main strengths. And with your ships all looking strikingly similar, I imagine, it can confuse the enemy on which ship is which."

Kaltbluter: "Zat is zee theory. That and the similarities make construction much easier." He shrugged a bit.

K: "We'll see if it plays out." I shrugged, as Blueblood paced up to join the dick-waving contest.

Blueblood: "Here she is. Inflexible." He pointed at the Ambelon ship as we approached her.

I could see she was an all-big-gun warship.. interesting, considering I'd designed American-style 1890's-era Pre-Dreadnaughts myself, dealing with the limitations of going first and having no supporting industry. The realization that Ambleion had, indeed, jumped me, dawned on me.

K: "..that's a Dreadnaught." I blinked. "No, that's a true Dreadnaught - those secondaries are about 150's, right?"

Blueblood: "Indeed." He nodded. "Main guns are 330mm. Breech-Loading, seperate charge and shell.""

K: "Superdreadnaught." I shrugged. "Anything above 305 is considered a Super-Dread."

Kaltbluter: "Vhat makes a Dreadnaught?" He tilted his head.

K: "All-big-guns. That is, a main battery of at least 255 millimeter, and no secondary gun above 155mm. A semi-dreadnaught would have a mixed main battery of guns larger than 255mm. The Thuringia would be a Light Dreadnaught, given her smaller main battery and a lack of any serious secondary."

Blueblood: "We have a lot of advanced features aboard the ship. She's Proofed, of course, but just barely, and only over the armor belt."

K: "Speed?"

Blueblood: "25 knots."

K: "Superdreadnaught." I nodded. "If she could make 32 knots, she'd be called a Fast Battleship." I shrugged. "Relative strengths of the Ambleion fleet?"

Blueblood: "Most of our ships make extensive use of electrical power to reduce ponypower requirements. Our strengths lie in the advanced technology - for example, electrical motors instead of hydraulic or manual boat cranes. We also seem to have the largest guns afloat." He explained. "So, I suppose one strength is powerful artillery. Our firing speed is higher than standard breech loaders, even with seperate charge ammo, since we use electrical motors to move shells from the magazine to the guns. We also have incredibly high powered optics on that observation deck up top there, giving us excellent detection range."

Kaltbluter: "Our main guns use hydraulics undt steam power. Much more robust." He nodded. "Zee Fire Control Computer ist entirely mechanical, so it can't be disabled ift we lose electricity. Our lights are zee only real electrical components vee heff." He put in, speaking of the Germane naval philosophy.

K: "Deployment style?" I asked Blueblood.

Blueblood: "Battleships anchor the gun line, supported by the armored cruisers. Protected Cruisers guard the flank, and act as forward screeners when at sail. Frigates deal with small vessels, Corvettes are dedicated torpedo ships. Both the Protected Cruisers and Corvettes have torpedoes. Our formation flank speed is 25 knots, though the Protected Cruisers, Frigates, and Corvettes do 30 or better."

K: "So, Ambleion ships have large guns and a relatively fast fire speed, incredibly long spotting ranges, average armor, and low speed." I looked to Sacquet, who was coming up with whom I presumed to be the Prench Admiral.

Sacquet: "Mon Marechal, this is Amirale Jeanne de Lauzun." He slightly bowed his head.

The Prench naval uniform was more.. ornate.. than the Germane one. More cords from the shoulder, and a Bicorne as well, though unlike the Germane one, the Prench one had a large fluff of feathers at the back. It was also a darkish blue, not black. The Admiral filling it was probably full-on MILF material for Equus, given her strong build and clear middle age. She was incredibly prideful, given her strut, but thankfully, didn't seem to be attracted to me in the least.

Am. Lauzun: "Marechal K." She nodded, then swept an arm towards the sea as a VERY tall battleship came into view. "La Normandie."

The main guns were all in front, with the secondaries at the back. It reminded me of the Richelieu-class battleships. Interesting that the Prench here would make the same design choices, and with much older technology.

She was flanked by two Torpedo Boats. Both looked fast, and were bristling with Torepedo Tubes. I noted that the Torpedo Boat didn't have proper turrets - instead, its "main guns" were inside the citadel of the superstructure, turning the whole oval-ish super structure into, in essence, one rather large turret.

K: "What are the relative strengths of Prench ships, admiral?" I asked flatly.

Am. Lauzun: *Ahem* "Zose turrets, Mon Marechal, are triple gun turrets. Our ships are designed for ze chase, to fire fore-on to ze enemy." She looked at her Germane counterpart, and gave a bit of a haughty strut. "We can keep up with our Ambleion counterparts, and have excellent damage control 'ouith strongly subdivided watertight compartments. Also, as you can see, our smokestack is part of ze superstructure, protecting most of it. We also have large numbers of boats, and a unique boat arrangement." She smirked. "Ve believe in lots and lots of guns for a high fire rate." She nodded. "Only zee Roaman fleet is faster zan our ships.. we focus on rapid strike, overwhelming initial fire, then suppression of ze enemy 'ouith ze heavier fleet units."

Blueblood: "Whereas we take a more balanced approach - like the Equestrian fleet." He put in.

Kaltbluter: "Unt we focus on being able to take fire from zee enemy unt not go down." He gestured, with an air of understanding.

Am. Lauzun: "Zee Torpedo Boats carry 19 torpedo launchers. Eh, she have no room for reloads, however." A shrug. "C'est la vie."

Klatbluter: "We heff fewer tubes on our Schnellboot, but each tube has one reload." He shrugged. "Still, is only one more available torpedo, by comparison."

K: "Got it." I nodded. "It seems I'm going to have a lot of thought to put in, on how to deploy your ships effectively, in the grand scheme of things." I shrugged. "I may call for you, if I have more questions. Until then, of course, I'd like to ask for basic specs on each ship to be sent to me, to help with my planning."

Kaltbluter: "Of course." A sharp nod.

Am. Lauzun: "Oui, mon Marechal." A haughty smile.

Blueblood: "I'll deliver them personally." He grinned.

Ah, what a fine fleet at my command. I hoped that their divergent strengths and capabilities would be enough to counter whatever Tirek was offering. I knew, just by instinct, what he did at Fillydelphia was less of an attempt at a debilitating strike, and more of a warning - he could easily spare six Capital Ships.. could I?

K: "Prince Blueblood, whom commands the Ambleion fleet?"

Blueblood: "Rear Admiral, the Right Honourable the Viscount Nailson Rodney of Marechester." He nodded. "I'm his Aide, actually."

K: "I see. And he's not here.. why?" I tilted my head, making sure there was no fuckery about.

Blueblood: "I.. requested this duty?" He tilted his head at me. "Ever since Chowsin Ridge, of course..."

K: "Ah, alright. I was just making sure I wasn't being politically slighted." I shrugged. "And the rest of you?"

Am. Lauzun: "Marechal K." She nodded. "I have heard of your exploits in Quirtbeck - I requested thees duty specifically on zat grounds." She raised her head. "I wished to meet ze human so brave he commands ze undying respect of My Majesty." She glanced at the others.

Kaltbluter: "I vas assigned." He shrugged. "A soldier does his duty, and judges zose only on zeir capacity to do zee same."

K: "I see." I shrugged. "You'll all forgive me, but I've been slighted before, because of my race, my birthing, or whatever other perceived inadequacy. Speaking of Chowsin Ridge, the Commander, here, is a fantastic shot."

Am. Lauzun: "I understand, Mon Marechal." She seemed satisfied with this. "Un I would like to see ze Prince's shooting ability some time.." She.. was casually flirting with him.

K: "That? That's nothing. Admiral Kaltbluter, here, took down a Mimic the other day." I smirked.

Kaltbluter: "Ach! General, you give me too much credit." He lowered his head in a grin, though. "I merely sealed its ability to shift forms." He shrugged a bit.

Am. Lauzun: "I see I am surrounded by ze bravest of NEIGHTO. I shall have to ensure I do not slack, un sully Prance's image." She gave me a bit of a look.

Sacquet: "Fear not, Amirale." He grinned. "Marechal K knows already ze bravery of ze Prenchpony." His grin was a more confident one.

K: "True, I do. Sacquet, here, stood up against several Generals and the previous Marshal of Prance when they did him wrong, after Qirtbeck." I gestured to him. "To say nothing of his exploits in the battle itself. I dare say he did perhaps even better than I could have, given the situation."

Sacquet grinned, and Amirale Lauzun gave a humm of approval - she may have heard what happened at Court, but not the details. Now, she'd likely ask him about them. Nothing like a little gossip, right?

We paced along the docks-under-repair and expansion, reviewing the fleet. I noted that the general hull lines of the ships from each nation bore striking similarities to their transports, which were all converted merchant or passenger liners. They'd constructed their naval designs based on their native commercial shipbuilding industries. Reorganization of superstructure and addition of arms being the only new things.

I saw a trash barrel off on the side that was wiggling in place, like something was in it. I held up a hand to my party, seeing this. Expecting a rat, I pointed at it, and nodded to Blueblood. He carefully unholstered his High Power, and held it in one fetlock, ready.

I saw a tail peek out from above the wooden trash barrel's rim.. and it wasn't a rat. It was canid. I casually held my arm out towards Blueblood, but he was already reholstering.

Kaltbluter was the one who stepped forwards first, reaching into the trash, and pulling out a Canidan puppy, with an apple core in his mouth.

Pup: "Hey! Put me down! I foun' dis first, you can't has it!" He wiggled a little in the Admiral's mouth.

Kaltbluter set him down gently, and lowered himself to the child's eye level.

Kaltbluter: "Vhere ist your vater unt mutter?" He was suddenly.. very soft in his tone and mannerism.

Pup: "I'unno.. I been by myself a while!" He was still guarding the apple core.

Kaltbluter: "Herr K.." He rose. "I vish to take him." He nodded.

K: "You mean.. adopt?" I tilted my head.

Kaltbluter: "Ja. I heff no sons. No daughters. My vife and I married late in life." He shrugged softly. "Vee vere.. are.. both career Navy officers."

K: "Go.. right ahead." I slowly shook my head. "I don't think anyone's gonna care." I gestured with one arm.

He carefully picked the Pup up and got him on his back.

Kaltbluter: "Heff you a name, child?"

Pup: "Nooo..." He shrugged. "Pup?"

Kaltbluter: "Siegfried. Seigfried Kaltbluter." He nodded to him.

Pup: "Sig.. freed.." He beamed a grin and wagged his tail. "I likes it!"

Kaltbluter: "Come. Ve get you fed." He started trotting away. "General K, ift you need anything, see my aide, Oberkapitan zur See Halter." With that, he trotted off with his new prize.

Blueblood: "I think we've been poached, old boy!" He smirked.

Am. Lauzun: "Oui. But ze pup is trŠs adorable!" She giggled.

Ponies will be ponies, after all!

Part 4: Delayed Departure

TIME: 07:33 ERDT
DATE: War Day 556/15 Decemus, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: 15nmi from Fillydelphia Harbor, aboard HMS Moonlight

The NEIGHTO combined fleet was at steam, travelling at 21kts. By my estimation, we would make landfall in Neighpon in 10 days. The last twelve days had been used to secure a pair of independent cruise liners from a ship company, and a grain carrier, then reorganize the landing forces.

The four commanders of their respective naval forces were in the command room with me - Rear Admiral Rodney, Amirale Lauzun, Vizeadmiral Kaltbluter, and Commodore Sargasso Sea.

K: "We'll first make landfall at Neigha. I've been told that the Emperor of Neighpon has made his temporary capital there. I'll need one company from each nation - selectponies, your sixty best - to train as Marine Raiders under Major Blinda." I nodded to her. "I'll be taking them out as I have time, blooding them, and bringing them back to educate their countryponies on what war's really like. They'll then be disseminated among the landing troops, and made NCO's if they aren't, already. That way some experience will be spread among all the troops."

Forest Spirit: "A majority of the Equestrian Marines are veterans of the initial 1MARDIV. Some were cycled out to different units for the same reasons. Each of you is contributing one battalion of Marine Infantry, and us, two. That's five total, plus one battalion of Artillery, two Equestrian Air Force Squadrons from Logistic Command, and a company of Paratroopers under Captain Weaver." He nodded to her.

K: "Ordinarily, she's part of my General Staff, but I specifically wanted her in charge of the Paratrooper detachment, owing to that experience." I gestured. "Amirale Lauzun, as I indicated, you'll have Colonel Sacquet as your overall landing force commander - he has experience, and now cross-training. You'll do fine." I looked at Blueblood, and Admiral Rodney. "I want to have a sit-down with Brigadier Fosberry, over there.." I looked to her. "..since she'll be commanding the Ambleion Marines. Prince Blueblood, you're literally the only Ambleion Officer with any combat experience."

Blueblood: "Indeed." He nodded.

Brigadier Adora Fosberry: "Of course, General."

K: "Same with Oberst Eisensattel." I looked at Kaltbluter, then the colonel next to him.

Kaltbluter: "Ja, General." A nod from him as well.

K: "The invasion of the home islands of Neighpon, if my intelligence is still good, will initially focus on the Capital region. Both as it's likely to be the best defended, and because the Emperor wishes to resume his throne before springtime. We should have enough time." I nodded. "Equestrian troops will be in the vanguard of the landing. Each nation will have its own axis of advance. This is city fighting, so in the time we have once we get there, and any spare time while at sea, we will practice moving in Platoon formations. Invasions are messy, and having complex objectives always results in partial failure or heavy casualties. General objectives are best." I pointed to the map. "Each Axis of Advance will have an end goal, and each unit within that axis will have a general lane they're to take. As your troops become more experienced, more sure of what they're doing, more complex objectives will be assigned to them. This is a warm-up for the invasion into Tirek's homeland, possibly as soon as the year after next..."

Kaltbluter: "Vhy so long?" He tilted his head.

K: "Technological developments. There's only so much you can do with infantry, when the enemy has mechanized and armored formations. When this war started, neither side had anything but infantry, and only in fairly small amounts. We now know Tirek has armored vehicles - they were used in Marelin almost a year ago - and possibly more. I want each nation to have its own armor, and its own powered aircraft. While the Crystal Kingdom will likely always have an advanced specialty in that area, each nation needs its own tactical air support to counter armor, and fortifications. Artillery alone is a bad idea." I nodded. "The troops that survive this invasion can go back and train others, tell them in their own cultural way, what to expect, what little tricks they've learned, and even improve your equipment, streamline your operations, and improve command and control." I shrugged. "When we hit Tirek on his own land, he'll fight like a cornered beast. I want each of us to have the best possible chances for survival - I will not invade until all the NEIGHTO alliance is ready."

Kaltbluter: "Mmm.. very vize." He nodded and looked up. "Vhat of the Roaman Empire?"

K: "I understand they have a good navy, and they have pre-firearm combat experience in Arabia. I'll be addressing them somewhat seperately, likely with Prance or Ambleion's backing. My own intelligence tells me that Tirek is attempting to sway the non-Equine races to join the war. I know that North Equus had a war with the Cervines and Saddle Arabia somewhat recently in history, and that forced the abandonment of many but not all colonies across the Great Sea. I wouldn't count them out, if they want the rest of that land back. Then there's Cowrea, which must be secured, both against the Kiangese and against Tirek." I nodded.

Am. Lauzun: "And ze Poles?" She tilted her head.

K: "They're much smaller. I'm going to see what I can do with them, but I may simply assign them to reserve duties in general. They'll still need experience, but if they haven't the same means to contribute as you all do, then their role must be comparatively sized." I gestured. "Each nation pulling only it's share of the weight, no one asked of more than their nation can give." I looked over at Kaltbluter. "Will Germaneigh allow Dockmark to have its own formations, or will Dockmarker enlistees be simply folded in to Germane units?"

Kaltbluter: "I heff no idea. I do know zat some of our troops are Dockmarker volunteers." He nodded. "Political policy is not my wheelhouse, ja?"

K: "Alright. Amirale, and Quirtbeck?"

Am. Lauzun: "Quirtbeckians 'ouill be part of ze Prench military, as was before ze war." She nodded.

K: "Admiral Rodney.." I looked at him. "..the Gatelics?"

Adm. Rodney: "The Ironish people are Ambleonian subjects. There is a specific formation of them - the Royal Ironish Regiment - but otherwise, they'll be assigned to existing Ambleonian units." He responded.

K: "What I also want to ask, is.. what is their desire for independence?" I tilted my head.

Adm. Rodney: "Excuse me!?" He seemed taken aback.

K: "Mmm.. in my world, their parallel, the Irish, have a long history of enslavement by your analogue, Albion, or England. And revolution, and infighting, and-"

Adm. Rodney: "There is absolutely no seperatist sentiment or independence movement in Ironland." He stated, very, very firmly.

There was silence. Amirale Lauzun and Vizeadmiral Kaltbluter were both looking at me, uncomfortably.

Forest Spirit: "I may be half-blind, Admiral Rodney, but even I can see you're lying through your horseteeth!" He clopped his hooves on the planning table.

Both Lauzun and Kaltbluter pulled back, with their Marine officers.

Adm. Rodney: "And.. you accuse me why?" He said, defensively.

Forest Spirit: "Tone, attituide, body language." He narrowed his eye. "And family history."

More silence.

K: "Blueblood." I looked right at him, as I had been the entire time. "We shed blood together. You'd never lie to me." I stared right at him. "Remember the Pies." I stuck that hook in. "Is Admiral Rodney telling us the truth?"

Blueblood: "I.."

Adm. Rodney: "..have no room to speak. You may be Prince of the Realm, and heir apparent, but you are under my command, Commander." He turned a bit to look at him.

K: "Admiral Rodney, you're excused." I stood up.

Adm. Rodney: "I beg your pardon!?" He stood up.

K: "As Supreme Allied Commander of the NEIGHTO allaince, I am dismissing you from your post as Ambleion Fleet Commander." I narrowed my eyes and leaned forwards. "You're lying to me. That means I can't trust you." I pointed to the door. "Your second-in-command wil-"

Adm. Rodney: "HOW DARE YOU, SIR!" He puffed himself up, and reeled his forehoof back.

Forest Spirit: "Blinda!" He nodded at the Admiral.

She and Forest Spirit both tackled him to the ground, before he could strike me. And when he tried to resist, backhanding Blinda, Forest Spirit hoof-punched him in the gut. Wind knocked from his sails, he gasped for air.

K: "You can NOW consider yourself under arrest! Princess Margaret will be receiving a report of your misconduct!" I pointed at him. "Expect to be stripped of rank AND royal priviledge!" I looked at Brigadier Fosberry, and Prince Blueblood. "And you two?"

I didn't see it, but Blinda got in a couple shots to his kidneys to pay him back.

Blueblood: "I would never.." He shook his head. "..raise a hoof to my friends and allies!" He looked at Admiral Rodney. "As Prince of the Realm, I *DO* strip you of the title of Viscount of Marechester." He gave him a disgusted look. "K gave you more than one chance to come clean." He looked at Brigadier Fosberry as the Marine guards entered.

Forest Spirit: "Lock this one in the brig!" He shoved Rodney at them. "He tried to hit the General."

The Marine guards dragged him out.

K: "I knew it. I just knew it. I had a feeling someone here resented me for some reason." I crossed my arms. "Somepony tell me the damn truth."

Forest Spirit: "My father and grandfather were driven from Ironland." He asserted. "They were.. were.. Ironish royalty." He glanced at Fosberry.

Brigadier Fosberry, for her part, just seemed very uncomfortable about all this.

Blueblood: "Spirit, I.." He was at a loss for words.

Forest Spirit: "It's okay, Blueblood." He put a hoof on his shoulder.

Brigadier Fosberry: "Well. I'll speak, then. The Admiral was wrong. There's always been a very.. passionate.. cultural movement in Ironland." She cleared her throat. "You understand, General, there's never really been anything you'd call 'violence' about it."

K: "Not as we've seen in the last year." I defined.

Brigadier Fosberry: "Exactly. There have been some incidents.. nothing.. serious." She shrugged a bit. "Ambleion.. took over-"

Forest Spirit: "-Conquered-"

Brigadier Fosberry: "-Conquered.. Ironland.. about three generations ago. It was more that we simply showed up and declared it part of our realm." She looked at Forest Spirit.

Forest Spirit: "Some resisted. They were beaten for their troubles, and had everything taken from them. My family, for example. An Ambleonian Lord decided that our ancestral castle would be his new home. We didn't like that. My great-grandfather was killed for that. My grandfather went into hiding with my father, and eventually came to Equestria." He sighed. "But, truthfully, K, not many were killed. A few, here and there, but nothing so serious as the Racial War a thousand years ago."

K: "What did Celestia do about it?" I asked, bluntly.

Brigadier Fosberry: "She didn't really do much of anything. Equestria was her land, we were simply.. an ally, sort-of. I do think she objected, but.." She shrugged.

K: "I see. So, there may well be a very serious independence movement to concern ourselves with, after all." I shrugged. "That could pose a serious internal threat to the NEIGHTO alliance." I looked at Fosberry. "What would happen if they suddenly received arms, and someone was there to tell them what to do with them? Hm?"

Brigadier Fosberry: "I see your point. I had a feeling this might come up, sooner or later." She shrugged uncomfortably.

K: "And Admiral Rodney?" I tilted my head.

Brigadier Fosberry: "I don't know him. We first met when I was assigned command of the Marines." She shrugged. "I've had little contact with him since the beginning of my assignment."

Blueblood: "Rodney was picked for his skill. He was one of the few professional navy officers our kingdom had - we were one of the few nations with some small standing military force. Nothing like what it's become, but.." He shrugged. "..Admiral Rodney, before being promoted to Rear Admiral, was commander of the Royal Navy Station at Catham. But, he has ship command experience."

K: "Go get his second-in-command." I nodded to Blueblood.

Blueblood: "Very well. I'll have to go signal Inflexible." He shrugged, and trotted for the bridge.

K: "Spirit, I want to thank you for keeping your professionalism despite your family history." I shook my head.

Forest Spirit: "You trusted me as Commandant of the Marines. I intend to set a good example, follow YOUR example. And not let personal feelings get in the way of my duty." He gave me a nod.

Well, now I had information regarding a threat within NEIGHTO. Something that would have to be addressed later, and with diplomacy, not fighting. Force would only lead to a Civil War.. which was the last thing we needed, and the first thing Tirek might want. As soon as I got back from Neighpon, I would have to take care of this.

Part 5: New Beginnings

TIME: 08:42 ERDT
DATE: War Day 556/15 Decemus, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Ward Room, HMS Moonlight, 39nmi from Fillydelphia Harbor

I was introduced, then, to Fleet Captain Moira Wellington, Rear Admiral Rodney's second-in-command. She was a Scotspony, like Gaze.

FCAPT Wellington: "Ayre, General." She gave me a short nod. "Maie apologies fer Admiral Rodney." She gave a short bow.

Gaze: "Ma'am." He gave her a nod and grin. "Major Lidless Gaze, General K's advisor on Cavalry. S'gut't'meet another Scotspony, ma'am."

FCAPT Wellington: "Ah! Well, tha e na thoileachas coinneachadh riut cuideachd, a Mh…idsear!" She beamed.

Gaze: "Is leamsa an tlachd, a Chaiptein." He beamed. "Ye'll pardon us, K. 'Tis been awhile since I spoken me ancestral tongue."

K: "How ancestral?" I tilted my head.

Gaze: "Welp, ye know, I spent most of me time in Equestria. Family moved there, and all." He shrugged. "But I was born in Scotland."

K: "Got it. Anyway, Captain Wellington, under my authority as Supreme Allied Commander, I'm making you the commander of the Ambleonian Fleet."

Wellington: "I waz wunderin' what happen't to the Admiral." She shook her head.

K: "Well, he did try to strike me, besides just lying to me. So, I placed him under arrest." I shrugged. "Since I have no other means at this time, he's in the Brig. I might have him moved to the SMS Thuringia, so he can be guarded by ponies that don't speak his language - less chance he can try to escape."

Wellington: "Ah, I understand. Nae objections - but we'll handle him once we get back home." She nodded. "Brigadier Fosberry." She nodded to her.

Fosberry: "I.. have advised General K about the situation in Ironland." She shrugged a bit. "He had to know."

Wellington: "Aye, then? Fine." She shrugged, herself. "I dinnae forsee any problems wi'in the fleet, General. Erryone here were specifically chosen fer their skills and their loyalty."

K: "Excellent. Brigadier Fosberry and Commander Blueblood will give you a briefing on our general plans. Once done, I want the Ambleonian Fleet on our right flank for the rest of the journey. Germanes in the rear, Prench on the left, and Equestrians in the center. Screen with your smaller vessels, but make sure you maintain visual and radio contact with them from your larger vessels at all times. I don't want anyone getting picked off. Keep your formation in a loose line abreast."

Wellington: "Aye, General. Ye seems t'have a bit'o a gift fer this." She smirked.

K: "Navy and Army are my specialties, in that order." I shrugged. "Anyhow, the fleet should be as loose as possible, with overlapping fields of fire." I indicated off to the port side with one hand. "Mainly to allow us to respond quickly, and prevent bunching up in a torpedo attack."

Wellington: "Aye, sir." She nodded, taking her own notes. "And in an engagement?"

K: "Each fleet will be responsible for securing their own flank, and operating as they see fit according to their own doctrine. The Equestrian and Germane fleets will respond to whichever side needs them, and they will provide support as that flank takes the lead. In short, you do as you've trained - and sink the enemy." I nodded.

Wellington: "M'h'am.." She jotted this down. "And during a landing?"

K: "The ships that have the best landing capabilities are the transports. I may assign some Marine Raiders to the scout or protected cruisers of each nation, to make the initial beach head with close-in naval gunfire support. Smaller vessels will be used to screen the landings. Battleships and Armored Cruisers will provide heavy gunfire support against designated targets as needed. If necessary, one fleet will be assigned as security, with the objective of sinking any interlopers. Likely the Prench, as they have the faster ships and can respond more quickly. The Germanes and your fleet will likely be tasked with direct support. Since the Germane ships are the best armored, they'll likely be the ones to move the closest to shore, while yours are farther back. Since the Equestrian fleet has a bit more experience, they'll likely take up an omniman role, covering whatever needs covering and plugging gaps. But, that will depend on the lay of the land when we start our invasions." I laid this out on the planning table, that had an aerial map of Fillydelphia Harbor, I was using for examples.

Wellington: "Aye." She nodded, noting all this. "So, ye'r playin' t' each fleet's stren'ths.." She gave me an admiring look.

K: "I am. Each nation took a different direction when it came to naval design, and that must be taken into account - I can't ask the slower Germane ships to rush in and strike fast moving targets, no more than I could ask Prench ships to take a heavy beating, or yours to maintain volume fire." I gestured.

Wellington: "Got'ch'ye.." She nodded thoughtfully.

K: "I'm glad you're receptive to all this." I shrugged a bit. "Rodney isn't the first one to come after me for my perceived inadequacies."

Applejack: "Uh-huh. Mah husband's been gone after by some right nasty characters." She snorted. "Bad thing 'bout treason, never comes from th' enemy."

Wellington: "Aye, that, lass." She said with a tone of apology.

Rarity: "Mm. I'm sure Mister Rodney will have plenty of time to reconsider his mistakes." She shrugged.

Gaze: "Ah'm just glad he di'int end up like Major Field." He frowned.

K: "Equestrian officer that tried to kill me, and Gaze, during the Battle of Ponyville." I shrugged to Captain Wellington.

Wellington: "Ah, fer-" She coughed. "-nasty bit, there." She corrected herself.

Gaze: "Aye." He nodded to Norfy. "His fiancee saved us."

Norfy: "Her." He nodded to Radio Active, who was coming in with Kiwi Spritz and Cosmic.

Wellington: "Ahh!" She grinned. "Well, ah'm glad't'see ah'm among brave company, as rumored." She nodded.

Radio: "Thank you, Captain." She nodded.

K: "Radio, everyone comfortable?" I asked.

Radio: "Everyone's got quarters, K."

Kaltbluter: "Vell. I shall return to my flagship." He gave a nod. "Amirale Lauzun, Captain Wellington, may I escort you to zee boat deck?" Ever the gentleman.

Wellington: "Aye, yes, Admiral Kaltbluter, thank ye." She nodded. "Major Gaze." She nodded to him. "General."

Am. Lauzun: "Marechal." She gave a short nod. "Colonel Sacquet, would you come along?"

Sacquet: "Oui, Amirale." He nodded to me. "See you in Neighpon."

K: "Indeed." I gave him a grin.

After the foreign officers all left, everyone visibly relaxed. Even Forest Spirit.

Gaze: "Ah'd'n't known, Spirit. Truly. It just wozzn't somethin' that came up a lot, aye?" He meant the occupation.

Forest Spirit: "What's done is done. We have Tirek to worry about, now. I'm sure the issue can be settled after the war." He looked at me.

K: "Yeah, and I'll have to be the one to do it, so I can avoid the same mistakes my world made." I shrugged. "The Irish started a general revolution after the First Great War, and reduced British holdings to a small corner of their land afterwards. After the Second Great War, there was a massive insurgency campaign on the part of the Irish. Thousands died on both sides, and while there was some semblence of civility about it, it degenerated into viciousness and.. sometimes indiscriminate violence." I shrugged. "It was solved with a peace treaty, after technically 75 years of on-and-off conflict, and that's only recent history. The actual territorial disputes go back hundreds of years."

Forest Spirit: "What would you propose?" He relaxed a bit as Gaze handed him a coffee.

K: "Referendum, county by county. Outside observers to ensure no vote-rigging or voter intimidation. Each county has a choice to remain or leave. If at least three counties agree to leave, form a new Ironish nation based on a Parliamentary Republic. How many total counties are there in Ironland?" I asked.

Forest Spirit: "Twenty two, originally. I think they've divided it into thirty, now." He shrugged.

Gaze: "Thirty." He nodded.

K: "Six counties, then, or twenty percent of the whole land."

Forest Spirit: "And if they all want out?" He sipped.

K: "Ambleion will just have to accept it. It's either that, or they get The Troubles, as we called them. And I know, even now, you don't have the stomach for that kind of conflict. The cat'll be out of the bag by the end of the war - kinda is already. I know there's arms smuggling, and legal arms sales, and there'll be some Ironish soldiers that desert, but go back to their cells of resistance and teach them the military way of doing things. Really, if the independence movement is strong enough, it's either accept it, or prepare for civil war. And in THAT case, Equestria and NEIGHTO absolutely must not intervene, or we set the precedent that NEIGHTO is there to maintain the specific order and rule of the ones in charge of it, and is not a tool to defend the nations and people that serve in it. America, my home, went down the path of interventionalism instead of reservation and internal prosperity. It worked, for a time, but it killed so many. Needlessly." I shook my head. "NEIGHTO cannot repeat that mistake."

Norfy: "I completely understand." He nodded. "For what it's worth, I agree."

Twilight: "I think we should all be glad that K has this kind of awareness of the sort of traps and pitfalls there are, out there.." She sighed.

K: "What makes matters worse, is, ostensibly, we did these things in the name of trying to help. Sometimes, the road to Tartarus is paved with good intentions."

Rarity: "Indeed, darling." She smiled.

So, that was the situation - I knew the Ironish question would have to be handled delicately. If something started sparking up, I would be the only one that could stop it from spreading to a massive fire, as I was the only one that understood where Good Intentions turned into Bad Results..

..on the other hand, I now had the force needed to invade Occupied Neighpon and kick Tirek out. Soon, we wouldn't be waging war over our own lands, held and invaded by his troops. We'd be taking the fight to him.
