I'm getting too old for this. Way. Too. Old.

Why am I even back here? Why? Why would the world, the powers that be, take me back here?! I've lost everything. Everything, everywhere.

And I'm here.

Again.

I rose up from the ground, and looked my old, tired body over. 44 years old. I'm not the young buck I was during the Great War.

I knew where I was, just by the smells that hit my nose. The deep irony that I was brought, once more, to a land of flowers and friendship...

And I was here. With gear.

My entire Go-Bag, my AR-15, my Browning Hi-Power in its shoulder holster. All my loaded mags. Spare ammo, shelter half, bed roll.. all the things I'd need to survive.

Why?

We'd won.

Or, so I thought.

When I went back to the Human World, I knew ten more years of happiness and joy. Now, my entire family, my wife, and everyone I cared for, was dead, or would no longer speak to me. My wife developed an infection in her heart not long after I got back. She held on for ten years.. the doctors gave her three.

My 'son' as it were, was brainwashed by my wife's sister, to think that I'd killed her for some reason. I didn't understand it. All I knew is, the "grandson" that I thought was mine, I wasn't allowed to even see pictures of.

My stepfather died of a stroke. My mother died of an infection she let get to her, not seeking proper medical care or even telling me how bad it was.

One night, I'd simply gone to bed, as usual, after another long shift. And then.. I woke up in the grass.

Now, I knew something was different, just by how the air 'felt' and the fact that I couldn't 'feel' any of the same feelings.

I loaded up. Everything. I wasn't quite sure where I was, so I did a rough sun plotting..

..If I was right, I was somewhere near Everfree Forest. Somewhere in the State of Erie. But, everything was different. Everything felt off. Like, majorly off. The usual sounds I'd hear in the forest, weren't there. SOME were, but not all of them.

I started wandering. Finally, I found some ruins. They were familiar.. a town, a small one.. and it looked abandoned fairly recently - in the last couple hundred years. Few graves, and the grave yard was not well tended. It was truly abandoned, indeed.

I finally found the village sign - Olivebridge. I thought back, and I was fairly sure that meant it was near Princesston. I recalled a train station sign at Princesston, mentioning it.

That meant I was about fifty miles south of Canterlot, and thirty miles from Ponyville - which replaced the town of Hudson, New York, in this world. I was quite a ways away from where I knew exactly where I was, but I had the general idea. Plowkeepsie was a fairly large town, or small full-on city, depending on how one thought about it, so, I picked the trail headed that way, and followed it.

I took a drink from my canteen, and smiled a bit. It felt good to be home. I chuckled to myself, thinking, if this was home, what was Earth, to me, any more? My birthplace?

No, Equus was home. This was home. I was home.

It started getting late in the afternoon, and I was abotu halfway to Princesston, but I noted, I couldn't find the rail line, or the paved military roads that should have been here. I surmised I was either in the distant past, or int he future or something.

And if I was sent to the FUTURE.. that meant.. I failed, somehow, to either stop Tirek, or something else had happened.

Just as I got to the ruins of Morgan Hill, another small town that looked like it had been abandoned, I decided to rest. I was so badly out of shape, now, it had taken me several hours to clear the few miles between the towns. I sat out in the open, not feeling any threat.

I heard, however, the VERY familiar sounds of a horse - nay, PONY - in trot.

Forcing myself to stand, I stood to attention, to greet whomever it was. I was greeted by the sight of an orange-coated mare, with purple hair, and lighter chromes down towards her unshorn fetlocks...

K: "Greetings!" I waved to her.

Problem was..

Sunny: "HOLY HAY BALES!" She came trotting over, with her satchel over her shoulder. "Are you...!? ARE YOU GENERAL K---!?"

K: "Ah." I blinked. Her buttons.. Twilight, Fluttershy.. Rainbow Dash.. I looked her over. She had a pistol belt on her. She also had a rank star on the shoulder strap. I stood to attention. "Yes, Warrant." I nodded. "And who are you?"

Sunny: "Sunny Starscout? Warrant Officer 1st Class, Maretime Bay Militia, Ordnance Section, Leading Armorer." She stood to attention, but didn't salute.

K: "Are we in danger, Warrant?" I nodded to her.

Sunny: "Might be. Still, not safe to salute in the field." She shrugged. "Come on, we need to get you to Maretime Bay."

K: "Maretime Bay, Cobneticut?"

Sunny: "Yes, sir." She nodded, leading the way.

K: "Aren't we near Canterlot?" I asked.

Sunny: "..oh, right, you wouldn't know." She stopped and turned to me. "There.. there is no Canterlot any more, sir. I.. it would have been over a thousand years ago. According to Princess Theia-"

K: "Theia?! MY DAUGHTER!?" I almost grabbed her, but I did get real close.

Sunny: "OH, YEAH, huh?! Yeah! Princess Theia is the Princess of New Equestria!" She beamed and tapped her hooves a bit.

K: "How far are we from Maretime Bay?" I tilted my head. "And is that where the Capital is?"

Sunny: "Uhm.. about.. 200 kilometers." She shrugged. "And.. not.. exactly?"

K: "So, why are you here, then?" I nodded to the little clearing I'd reappared in. "Pleasure hike? Vacation?"

Sunny: "Ahhh..." She blushed, and scratched the back of her head. "..I-I thought you might come back. I was convinced of it! So.. I.. took some leave to try and find where you might come back TO." She gestured to her tent and things outside of the ruins. "So.. I.. took some liberty and.." She looked towards the forest. "..took me a week to get here." She spoke excitedly, as though I was the answer to everything.

K: "We're close to Canterlot and Ponyville - and really close to Princesston." I nodded.

Sunny: "Y-Yeah.. no Ponyville, either. Everything north of here is a dead zone." She shrugged. "Princesston was abandoned." She looked down.

We sat down by her campfire, and she got out a set of very modern camping gear. She started making tea. I could smell the familiar essence of Red Fireleaf Tea..

K: "..I missed that smell." I nodded, getting my own pack off. "What're you packing?"

She gave me a look, and handed over her sidearm.

Sunny: "It's a 2002-pattern Roc, based on the Morgan. Double stack, 10x23mm. 14 plus 1." She nodded. "Light rail, fiber optic sights, threaded 120mm barrel. 1/28 pitch, threaded for a Swallowtail suppressor."

I hefted it, examined it, and ejected the mag, examined the ammo, and reinserted it. The ammo looked to be 150gr flatpoints, bottlenecked. It was Flat Dark Earth (FDE) brown, too, and had a symbol on the dust cover that seemed to be the Maretime Bay militia logo. The tactical light was an LED, and a strong one. It was a bit on the large size for a pony, approaching a full sized 1911 on Earth. As it was based on this type, but double stack, on Earth, this would be called a "2011 frame."

K: "Nice." I handed over my Browning. "Browning High Power. It's very smiliar to the old L2 Pistol."

Sunny: "Mmm. I saw an L2 in the War Museum." She blinked a bit. "You.. you must know that.." She shrugged. "..they're all dead. From the past. Right?"

K: "..yeah.." I blinked, looking at the ground, and getting my own Camp Cup out and holding it out.

Sunny: "S-Sorry.." She blinked, and gently bit the bottom of her lip. Then, realizing the tea was ready, poured mine first. "Your daughter left orders that WHEN you returned, we were to assume you're Commander in Chief, again."

K: "There's so much I need to know." I blinked.

She slid closer to me, and rest herself against me. Timidly, at first, then she just went for it and nuzzled into me.

Sunny: "Everyone thought I was crazy." She blinked. "Except my friend Hitch." She nodded. "It's been.." She looked towards the woods. "..things have been pretty crazy the last thousand years."

I wrapped an arm around her. Hugged her close. She seemed to need it.

K: "I'm glad I have a friend, at least." I nodded.

Sunny: "I-I'm glad the legends are true and you.. you ARE so warm and kind." She sighed. "Wait. Let me get my notebook!" She moved over to her backpack and dug into it - it also bore the Militia logo and looked like an updated, modular backpack from the 2020's. She pulled out a notebook brimming with little flag stickers for certain pages, and hand-drawn cutie marks all over. "One hundred and forty-two questions for General K!"

K: "..this is going to take a bit." I smirked, and sipped the tea - I missed the flavor. "Go slowly."

Sunny: "Ah-well.. Question 1. Where are you from?" She blinked.

K: "The Equestrian state would be called Sequoyah, city of Tussle." I nodded. "Old state, any way."

Sunny: "R-Right.." She blinked. "Question 2! Did you really live at a farm!?"

K: "I lived at Sweet Apple Acres during the war, yes." I nodded.

Sunny: "Q-Question three - what's the ORIGINAL Pizza Recipe!?" She was getting more and more excited.

K: "The first pizza I made was a 12-inch round with a commercial sauce meant for Roaman Pasta, topped with shredded farm cheese that's close to Mozzarella, and ham slices. I made a second one with sliced bell peppers and mushrooms." I nodded.

Sunny: "Number four! Could you actually fry entire cities with a Sunshatterer?!" She leaned in.

K: "It was.. I think you mean Daybreaker Device, and yes. They existed." I nodded.

Sunny: "Five! Is it true you drank so much coffee that you floated away?! Like, filled a pool with it?!" She blinked rapidly.

K: "Ahh.. I have a fondness for coffee, but not.. not like that." I shrugged. "Maybe a full pot's worth a day. More if I was at the Palace."

Sunny: "Six! Uh.. was Celestia the first princess you.. uhm.. well.."

K: "Luna. And we were together the entire time I was here." I nodded, then smirked. "Celestia was second."

Sunny: "SEVEN! Oh, wow.. uh.. well.." She blushed.

K: "I have a feeling I know what you want to ask." I nodded. "I can last between fifteen and thirty minutes doing just straight motions. I tend to stretch it out much longer with a combination of foreplay and cuddles." And smirked.

She wiggled a bit, blushing.

Sunny: "Actually, uh.. I was.. that was number nine. Eight.. um. Size." She blinked, flushed in the cheeks.

I demonstrated using my hands.

K: "I'm not as large as a Stallion. I'm just better at it." I smirked, and shrugged.

Sunny: "I-I.." She hid behind the notebook a bit. "S-Sorry, just.. I was.. kinda raised on the stories of what you could do! And.. and.. I always thought you'd come back. Like, there's no way you actually DID save us. And, like, everything was a mess for so long. There's no WAY in TARTARUS that you'd EVER let us.." She looked down. "..you wouldn't leave us for good."

K: "My turn for a few." I nodded. "When did the Apocalypse happen? What caused it? And who stopped it?"

Sunny: "It.. was.. some time after you left. Only Princess Theia knows all about it. She chose to keep things a secret because she said that if everypony knew, somepony might.. try and undo what was done to seal it all away." She frowned. "I-I don't know what it was. WHO. It was. Anything like that." And shrugged. "It's a state secret. I don't have the clearance."

K: "Alright." I looked down at the ground. "Casualties?"

Sunny grew very cold, and curled her tail around her protectively.

Sunny: "B-Billions." She sniffled. "From what I know of history, most of the world was ravaged by.. we call it Ragnarok." She wiped a tear. "I-I keep.. thinking about.. all the little foals that.. never had a chance." She looked up at me. "On the Day of Ragnarok, the Gift of Magic was lost. Almost forever. It's.. there's still some.. but.. it's not nearly what it used to be."

K: "What's.. NEW Equestria?" I nodded to her.

Sunny: "Maretime Bay, Cobneticut. Bridlewood, Erie. Zephyr Heights, Greenbroke." She sighed. "There's smaller villages around. There's The Remnant at Baleston.. and The Eternal Vigil at Manehattan." She looked out at the forest. "The.. the Barriers.. the Ley Line Barriers.. now stretch across chunks of The Inner World, ever since Ragnarok. The.. the Old Gods of the North.." She almost curled up on herself. "..punished us. Helreignn, he called us all out. Odin.. before The Final Battle of the Heavens began.. he was the one that said we deserved to have whatever world was left, smaller. Th-We didn't deserve the world."

K: "That's.." I shook my head. "..can we travel to Europe?"

Sunny: "Not by land. Sea only. There's trade, but it's limited. To be honest, I.. I don't know much about it." She slowly shook her head. "I feel like.. even right after it happened, there was so much more contact. And everything's slowly slid into ruin over the last thousand years." She held up her pistol. "These are all hand made. Yeah, to a standard pattern, but.." She shook her head. "..we don't have a huge factory churning them out."

K: "You have enough, but not much extra." I nodded. "Estimated population of the entire kingdom?"

Sunny: "Ah.. 14 million?" She shrugged. "Zephyr Heights has most of it. Mainly Pegasi live there. Not.. completely. It's like.. 70% Pegasi and 30% others. Bridlewood is like that with Unicorns. Maretime Bay is like that with Terrans."

K: "Terrans? You mean Earth Ponies?" I nodded.

Sunny: "Yeah." She looked at the ground. "I.. Like, I feel like I failed you some how. Princess Theia likes to talk about when she was very little and growing up.." She looked up at me. "Who was Dusk Seeker?"

K: "..my best friend." I frowned. "One of them."

Sunny: "He must've been.. awesome." She said with a bit of wonderment.

K: "Do you know the Universal Laws?" I asked.

Sunny: "Mostly. There's.. like.. some we're not told." She shrugged a bit. "Princess Theia says.. she doesn't want us being paranoid about them."

K: "Such as?" I nodded to her.

Sunny: "Why magic is gone." She looked crestfallen.

K: "Magic is gone?!" I narrowed my eyes - this was inconcieveable!

Sunny: "Yeah.. that's.. I mean." She shuffled her hooves a bit. "I had a theory that you'd return, but I didn't know when. That's why I've been coming out this way, when I can. I'm trying to meet someone from Bridlewood. I'm hoping they have some answers." She sighed. "Back home.. it's like.. the other Terrans don't really care all that much." She shrugged. "I know magic is real. Some kind of magic. Something. It was real, once. Princess Theia talks about it sometimes. But, it's gone. And.. it's like no one cares." She lowered her head again.

K: "They aren't worried about their friends?" I shrugged.

Sunny: "Friends!" She scoffed. "Ponies are too absorbed into their own lives to have friends. Let alone friends outside their own species.." She trailed off.

K: "Mm." I looked right at her. "I know you're only a Warrant Officer in the Quartermaster Corps, but in your estimation, do you think this world is coming close to forgetting the Lessons of Harmony once again?"

Sunny: "I..." She sunk back a bit, her excitement from before replaced by trepidation, fear, and shame. "..do, General."

K: "Then we must fix it." I nodded. "You're with me. Lieutenant."

Sunny: "LIEUTENANT!?" She just about came out of her skin. "M-ME?!"

K: "Yes, and for the time being, you're all I have for a General's Staff." I smiled a bit. "Is Bridlewood closer than Maretime Bay?"

Sunny: "Y-Yeah, but.. I've never actually been there." She shrugged. "I keep hoping if I can get close enough between my duties, whatever time I have, I can meet a unicorn from there.." She shrugged a bit.

K: "What time is it? And the date?" I up-nodded to her.

She took out her cell phone and poked it.

Sunny: "..17:32 hours, Royal Standard Time. 7th of Septimus, 2054 C.S." She looked up at me. "Princess Theia maintains Celestia Sol as our year."

K: "Right." I adjusted my watch.
