Part 1: Dare to Arrest

TIME: 11:40 GMT
DATE: War Day 988/19 Lunaris 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: City of York, Ambleon


We'd spent the last day and a half combing the countryside for more terrorists. The butcher bill was telling - 27 dead civilians, 7 Royal Air Force officers, including the Group Captain and his two top officers, the mayor, the assistant to the mayor, and the local Home Guard executive officer.

For this, we killed 14 terrorists, and a few of Tirek's troops. The Gizmonk Mage made it clear that Dr. Caballeron was on the take from Tirek, and had been made the boss of the operation, since he had a lot of local knowledge. It had been his idea to grab some of the most radical Ironish Separatists from Ironland, arm them, and get them to attack us.

Dr. Caballeron didn't care one way or another what their goal was - his goal had been the Harmony Stone. It seemed the terrorists just wanted to kill important NEIGHTO officials, no matter who. Unfocused violence.

Daring Do's arrest was front page news in all the local and national papers. The article had been written by Elsie. She was now VERY famous for covering the event. So much so that her former boss sent her a telegram asking her why she was being published under the rank of "Warrant Officer Elsie Bon Voyage" and not as a civilian. She sent him a telegram back telling him to pound sand, but in more verbose language.

The Crown Prosecution Service was going to push for the maximum sentence under the Act. Ten years. This is when I learned that jails around here work differently. Once convicted, the nation that the convict was originally from, is to take custody of them for the term of their imprisonment. However, justice is adjudicated by the nation they're arrested in. As are appeals and parole. So, she'd be going back to Equestria once her trial was complete.

The Crown Prosecution Service vowed to get it done in less than a month. After all, she had no defense, and had confessed to violating the National Treasures Act. There was nothing she could do to argue her innocence. All she could do was beg the court for mercy. She would find none.

The CAG members along for the trip were currently stripping the entire University for clues. Home Guard personnel were on-site. We went ahead and detained every Unicorn on campus while Dusk, Dusty and Chemical Lens worked through all of them to determine of any were Unicorn Supremacists.

I was in the main library with Elsie, Broken, Golden, Fluttershy and Moon Dancer. We'd been up all night. Dancer was draped across my lap with a book.. and her face in it. I'd taken off her glasses.

Broken: "She asleep, K?" He leaned over, and Magellan leaned over his shoulder.

K: "Yup. Worked herself to the bone. Anything?" I nodded to the stacks of scrolls we'd uncovered in a hidden vault cache behind a wall.

Broken: "Nothin' special so far." He shrugged. "Several ref'rences t'the harmony stone, though!" He smiled, excitedly.

K: "You're unflappable, you know that?" I smirked.

Broken: "Aw." He smiled, and Magellan hid his beak with his wing.

K: "I mean it. You've had your soul raked over the coals the last few days. One hit after another. And you're still exuberant and full of life." I shook my head slowly. "Some men - stallions - would've cracked and gone slinking off into the Bottle, by now."

Broken: "Ach." He shook his head, with Magellan matching him. "I can't let such things hurt me. There's a lot ridin' on what I know, and what I can deduce. I gotta job t'do. I.." He looked away, though Magellan looked at me. "..if my brain can save lives, by Celestia, I want to do it. I have to." He smiled a bit. "Couldn't rightly live with meself if I didn't."

K: "You're a good stallion, Broken." I looked over at the two love birds - they were blushing and reading together. "I'm lucky to meet such good friends wherever I go."

Golden: "Aye. An' friends what can deal with the ones that don't wanna be friends!" He smiled.

Fluttershy: "Hmm!" She smiled warmly.

I leaned over to them both.. looking mainly at Fluttershy.

K: "Have you..." I gestured to Golden. "..told him?"

Fluttershy: "..no." She blinked.

K: "Maybe it's just me, but.. I think he deserves to know." I shrugged. "I.. I did sleep with her." I gestured a bit, sliding Moon Dancer to one side. "I've slept with all the Elements of Harmony and both Princesses." I gestured a bit with one hand.

Fluttershy looked at me with a bit of confusion, and I looked back as though to say 'you can tell him the rest when you're ready.'

Golden: "Ah'll admit to bein' a bit jealous." He smiled at the corner of his mouth a bit.

K: "Mhm. We did it for other reasons - lust, I think. You.. you love her. That changes everything." I shook my head slowly. "She's been through a lot. She's ready to love someone with her whole heart, and it's you. In a way, I'm the one that should be jealous - she was the first pony to find me." I smirked a bit.

Golden: "Oh, really?" He blinked. "Ah didn't know that." He shrugged.

K: "Yep. She even admitted she had a bit of something for me." I shrugged back. "But.. nah." I shook my head. "Once I laid eyes on her.." I said, with AJ coming in the room with lunch. "..it was all over for me."

Fluttershy: "I also realized that.. I was attached for the wrong reasons." She blushed, and 'wing-feathered' with Golden - that is, they intertwined their flight feathers as though they were holding hands.

K: "Sometimes we need to address the feelings we have, to see if they're genuine." I said, as AJ helped slide Moon Dancer off my lap and to a neighboring couch, so she could.. straddle me.

Applejack: "Yup." She said in a soft voice. "Ever since he.. called me purty.. made me realize.. ah'm a mare, not jes' an' apple farmer.. that I deserve t'be loved.." She nuzzled my neck affectionately. "..t'was all over f'me, too."

Elsie: "I hate to interrupt this love fest.." She paced over from the cache. "..I think I found something." She held out a parchment.

I leaned over and took it, strategically placing it between me and my wife. The text was very old, and it was written in Late Middle English, not modern English. I tilted my head sideways to read thoroughly.

Translated, it reads as follows:
"Come hither the times not set,
One alone will stand yet.

All his life and fortune. And that of others.

Against the darkness and all its followers.

To them whomst stand on legs only two,
can find victory in a bolt from the blue."

K: "..I think it's talking about lightning." I nodded. "A Noble element, right? Thunder?" I nodded. They all blinked at me. Right, not Unicorns. And Moon Dancer was asleep - I wasn't going to wake her up. "I have more questions here." I shrugged.

Broken: "Well.. ONE thing I can suggest.." He gestured a bit, and Magellan copied him with his wing. "..if ye've been getting powers from The Old Gods, right? Why not hit'em up directly-like?"

K: "What do you mean?" I nodded to him.

Broken: "Jupiter." He nodded. "Roam. The old Roaman god Jupiter controlled the skies, and controlled lightning. If'n ye need it..?"

K: "Why not go to Rome - Roam - and confront him, somehow?" I smirked. "Good idea."

Yes, they are pronounced slightly differently.

I looked over and Golden and Fluttershy were very gently touching snootles, both wings intertwined. It was so cute, I snapped a pic on my cell phone. A core memory of seeing two of my friends so happy, they were totally lost in their own world.

Fortune and life? I'd give mine right now, right here, if it meant those two and so many others could get lost like this, in peace, forever.

[End of Part 1]

Part 2: Hopover

TIME: 13:50 GMT
DATE: War Day 989/20 Lunaris 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Train leaving York, Ambleon


I was seated in the main car with most of the others. Bluey was prancing around, having just been introduced to us. Magellan was.. showing him the ropes?

Golden's friend dropped Bluey off at the University late yesterday, and after seizing the rest of the materials and sending them back to Londinium for the rest of the CAG team to look over, we rested, and got on a train to Cirencester the next morning.

Cirencester Magical College was a smaller locale, but MUCH older, dating back to pre-Celestia days. The original site had something to do with the Pony take on the Arthurian Legend. I found it interesting that their Arthurian Legend actually dated back to what would be considered the "medieval times" before Generation 3.

It's important to remember that "Generation 1" was 10,000 years ago, or "8,000 B.C." (Before Celestia), and Generation 2 was 8,000 years ago, or "6,000 B.C."

Generation 3 was an outgrowth of the Last Empire of Harmony. It ceased to exist roughly a thousand years before Celestia came to.. force harmony.. on the ponies. That placed G3's Arthurian Time about 2,700 years ago, or 1700 B.C.

I was bounced from my reflection by Bluey popping up under my arm demanding I pet him. I skritched his ears for a bit, and he tilted his head at me, as if to ask what the matter was.

K: "Oh, everything'll be fine, Bluey." I nodded. "We just need time."

Bluey: *Arf!* He licked my face, and twirled around once.

K: "Oh, you just want to be EVERYONE'S friend, huh?!" That got me out of my seat, and kneeling, to pet him. He knew it, too, and he flopped on his back and demanded pettings ALL OVER. "Oh, you KNOW how adorable you are, huh?" I smirked. "Pup."

Gilda: "Isn't he something?" She smiled. "Dash wants to get another Turtle for Tank."

K: "Oh, yeah?" I nodded.

Sunset: "I had a pet Dwarf Pygmy Salamander as a foal. The kind that spits fire?" She smirked from around the seat ahead of me.

K: "What was their name?" I had to know.

Sunset: "Zippy." She nodded.

K: "Huh." I shrugged.

Lyra: "Oh, aye. I got me a songberd. A yeller robin." She smirked. "Ye've seen'er, K."

K: "Yeah. Minty." I nodded. "And she pairs with Bon-Bon's Sparrow, too."

Applejack and Twilight came up, about then.

Twilight: "K, can we talk to you?" She tilted her head at me.

K: "Any time." I nodded. "Honey."

Applejack: "Honeybun.. ahh.. we been talkin' - an' I gotta ask. You think it's such a good idea t'keep Daring Do locked up like that?" She shrugged a bit. "Not sayin' I disagrees, but.. them Universal Laws'n stuff.."

K: "I getcha. Yeah, I know, it's a risk. Just because two of her greatest rivals are dead, does NOT mean that a catalyst for her, isn't still out there somewhere." I stood up, and started walking to the Dining Car.

Twilight: "And yet.." She wanted to know my reasoning.

K: "And yet, it's the only thing we can really do, and still be The Good Guys. The BAD guys would have killed her, because she represents a threat. The GOOD guys.. follow the law as best they can, given exigent circumstances. In THIS case, the only thing we can really do is try to contain her. She's a Protagonist. She has her own mythos and legend. She's a force equal to any one of us. The problem is, she's being run COUNTER to us in some ways. She's admitted she's an addict for danger. In the old days, before the war, when violence was non-lethal in nearly every single instance, this was fine. She could get away with being the main character in her own stories. At best, some background characters get roughed up, some mooks get tossed into traps, and while there might be bumps and bruises, no one is permanently disabled, unless it's a plot point. Now, she's a foci of chaos. She can't keep operating on her own, not now. Tirek is a stronger Antagonist than she is a Protagonist, and if he sends Scorpan or someone else of equal rank, she's going to die. What then? Propaganda victory for Tirek, and morale in NEIGHTO drops, knowing that someone LIKE HER was taken out by Tirek.. and I'm sure he'll paint it as a very easy victory, and her as suffering greatly, with humiliation. Or worse!" I pointed a finger at Twilight. "He turns her against us somehow - brainwashing, magic, hypnosis, whatever." I shook my head, sitting down at the bar. "Root Beer, please." I nodded to Dusty, who was working the bar herself, so no unauthorized ears were anywhere near CAG. Plus, she did bartend for a while, on her quest to find her Talent.

Dusty: "Oh, I agree with K." She set two Root Beers and a Cider down in front of us, and got a Chocolate Soda for herself. "And I -also- have a sneaking suspicion that this isn't a permanent fix. I don't even think it'll last more than a few months." She shook her head. "Her next book is due to drop in the middle of next year. If her adventure is this one, she'll still need a month or so to write it and get it to her Publisher." She gestured.

I drank the Root Beer, and nodded. Unlike Root Beer on Earth, this WAS made with Sassafras Root.

Twilight: "Sooo.. what, then?" She shrugged. "What do we do?"

K: "If I'm right - if we're all close to right about her and her situation, she's going to get brought back on to the field, somehow. Something is going to happen. Some problem that WE can't handle without her help. Or.. something." I dismissively waved a hand. "At that point, we do what we're called to do - we recruit her. Make her part of CAG. So we can contain the chaos, rather than fight it." I nodded.

Applejack: "Mmm.." She lowered her head. "..an' ya didn't wanna do that b'fore, cuz..?"

K: "She wasn't ready." I nodded. "If I'd asked, she would have given me a spiel about how she's a one-mare show, how she's a private citizen, and doesn't want to be a part of something like this, because... reasons. Maybe we represent rigid order and control to her that she's not used to? Maybe we represent something she's afraid of - depending on others? I don't know, but I do know the RULES at play here. When you first meet a Protagonist like her, that's based on being all by themselves, they're RARELY interested in anything more than a momentary team-up - they aren't ready to join an adventuring party, not yet. They need another cold splash of reality, first." I nodded.

Twilight: "Wow.. how do you KNOW all this?" She shrugged a bit.

K: "I read, too, Twilight. I read a lot of Fiction as well as Fact." I gently booped her nose with my index finger. "When you learn Fiction, you learn.. call them condensed universal facts that seem to come up time and again in the Human - or Equine - condition. Art imitates Life, Life imitates Art." I nodded firmly, as Flash came in.

Flash: "Ah, there you are." He nodded to me, and Twilight.

K: "I know Flash.. LOVES comics and things. Don't look down on what he consumes. As both part of being married AND part of being together.. you need to merge these, a bit. Your lust for hard science and knowledge.. his enjoyment of fanciful tales. You would both learn something." I nodded.

Applejack slung her forelegs over my arm and hugged on me.

Applejack: "Mmmmmmmm.. ah married me a smart'un.." She nuzzled a bit. "Y'all gots wisdom."

K: "I also have the most beautiful wife." I kissed her nose. "Who's not stupid, herself."

She blushed.

Twilight: "Ah, well.." She gestured a bit, as Flash came up behind her and slid his forelegs over her. "Flash!"

Flash: "I, too, have a most beautiful wife.. one I'm dedicated to." He nuzzled her neck. "I can't even.. begin to say how lucky I am."

Rarity: "Oh, indeed." She stepped in with Dusk. "We are so fortunate that this war has given us.." She nuzzled his ear. "..some so-amazing things."

K: "Yeah, a lot of us have found.. incredible love because of this war." I nodded.


TIME: 17:27 GMT
LOCATION: Cirencester, Gloucestershire, Ambleon

We arrived. And under heavy security, this time. The Gloucestershire Home Guard Regiment had secured the train depot, and already had Tilly's waiting for us. As per arrangement, CAG would be quartered at a local manor house owned by the Crown but rarely used.

Rarely, as in, there was no permanent house staff, and they had to scramble to get food and other vital supplies sent there. It was also the only location in the area they could guarantee was secure.

Capt. Havastaff: "Ah, General K!" An older Unicorn gentlecolt with a monocle, in uniform, stepped up to me as we disembarked. "Captain Willya Havastaff. Gloucestershire Home Guard, Personnel Officer." He shook hoof-and-hand with me immediately.

K: "Captain." I nodded to him. "Is everything ready for us?"

Capt. Havastaff: "Indeed, sir!" He nodded affirmatively. "We have a convoy ready to run you to the Manor House. We hope the Magical College has the answers we need, sir." He nodded, as the Tilly's were brought up, and my staff started loading everything in. "It's very old - I know my grandfather's great-grandfather once worked there. He told tales of strange secrets, hidden passages, and more. I.. thought it best to bring you this, sir, personally." He handed me a stack of small books. "His diary, sir. Mayhap a clue or two lies within? I've not read all of them myself."

K: "I'll try to return these, undamaged, Captain." I nodded, and patted his shoulder. "Thank you." I nodded to the rest of the team.

Steela: "Come, K! We go, ja?" She smiled.

K: "We'll be in touch. Remember, we'll be on a dedicated frequency. Make sure someone's listening, in case we need help." I nodded to him, as I made for the Tilly.

Capt. Havastaff: "Of course, sir!" He nodded firmly.

With that, we were off to the Manor House. I wondered just what was in store for us at Cirencester Magical College, but I was wagering, it was going to be something.. very in depth.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Haunted Manor!

TIME: 00:13 GMT
DATE: War Day 990/21 Lunaris, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Cirencester Manor, Gloucestershire, Ambleon


I was in a very large bed with Applejack, Dusty, Steela, and Sunset. We had not fucked, but for lack of beds, all the married couples were doubled up. And in my case, my "harem" had decided for logistical reasons, we'd take the largest bed and make it work.

I had AJ on top of me, Steela on the foot of the bed, Dusty cuddled up to my right side, and Sunset to my left. The bed was large enough that all of us fit, and even though Steela had the "bottom" of the blankets, she was fully covered, and I had to stretch a bit to get my feet to touch her.

She was not letting this Bodyguard thing go slack.

Our weapons were all within reach, too, just in case. We weren't taking any chances. The Home Guard were patrolling the outside of the manor house, around the stone wall that enclosed it. Within the manor, two Squads of Home Guard were patrolling as well.

There was no reason, no possibility that something could happen...


..then again, this is us.

*Loud, mournful wail*

K: "..mmhff.. Steela.. shh.." I adjusted my position a bit.

Steela: "..was not me, K." She was suddenly very serious. And awake.

*LOOOOUD, mournful wail*

We were all awake. And rolling out of bed.

Sunset: "Catch!" She hefted me the Sword of Rainbow's Light.

Steela: "I have machine gun ready." She racked the bolt of her Abrams.

Applejack: "Mmmhmm.." She growled a bit, and took the safety off of her Chaffee.

Dusty: "I hate getting woke up." She slid a contact burst shell into her Grant/Gavin.

*Home Guard pony screams in terror*

K: "Sounds bad." I got my pants on, and the tactical suspenders attached to it - I had been in bed in only an A-Frame and my undies and socks. Feet found boots, and I cinched them up. "What do we think it is?"

Sunset: "Sounds like some kind of spectre." She frowned.

K: "Come on." I stepped to the door, and cracked it open.

Outside, I saw a Home Guard pony running up the hallway, in terror. I reached out, as he was about to pass by, and grabbed him around the straps of his own tactical suspenders, and dragged him inside.

Home Guard Private: "AHH! NAE! DIN' EAT ME SOUL!!!" He screamed at the top of his lungs, as I threw him to the floor, face up. When he realized it was us, he stopped screaming.. and curled up and started crying.

K: "Report, Private!" I said loud and clear, to get his attention.

Home Guard Private: "Baw-haw-haw..! IT'S HORRIBLE, SIRE!" He shoved his hooves into his face. Hard. I had to pull them away, to keep him from hurting himself. "'TIS TH' GREEN MARE! W-We need to GO! WE NEED TO GO! She.. she'll KILL us ALL an' DAMN our SOULS tae TARTARUS!"

K: "Dusty, restrain him." I pointed at her. "He's gone mad."

Dusty: "No kidding." She roped him down, and took off anything he might use to hurt himself.

K: C> "K to all Callsigns. We have a haunting. Anyone know anything about The Green Mare?"

There was a short silence.

Broken: C> "K. Trust me. If it's her. We need to leave. NOW!" He started, harshly.

Golden: C> "Ah'm with Broken, K! Sh-She's not somethin' ya wanna muck about with!"

Lyra: C> "AYE! K, for th' love'a Celestia-"

I could hear Gaze over her mic.

Gaze: C> "WE NEEDS TAE GIT OUTTA HERE, MATE! YE DON'T GET IT!"

K: C> "Alright. Everyone assemble in the front hall. Grab your essential gear, get ready to evac." I nodded, and looked at Sunset with a cocked brow.

Sunset: "We're not going to Evac, are we?" She gave me a look.

K: "Nope." I nodded. "I get it, they're freaked, they've probably heard stories about this stuff all their lives. So, they're rightly freaked. If this is a ghost, a real ghost, guns aren't going to work." I slid my Grant behind my back on its strap.

Steela: "Wish I had Gungnir." She frowned.

Sunset: "Magic will work, though - don't you all worry." She smirked. "I'll watch out for you all." And puffed herself up.

Dusty: "See, this is how a proper Harem should work." She nodded to the others. "As a team."

K: "I'm really just meat and hugs to you all, aren't I?!" I laughed.

Steela: "Mm." She gave me a tiny nudge. "Best meat. Best hugs."

Applejack: "Mhm." She swayed her hips a bit. "Mah stallion's got what all the mares want." She nuzzled Dusty. "Ah don't min' sharin' a bit."

Sunset: "At least I know I have people that really care." She nodded.

We got down to the main entrance, and the Unicorns were shielding the others. Twilight was in the lead. She was pissed. Spike was pacing around, determined.

K: "Report." I nodded.

Twilight: "Everyone that's from Ambleon or Ironland.." She nodded to Lyra. "..is terrified."

Gaze: "We ready t'go, 're what?!" He was.. very upset - this was very unlike him.

K: "Twilight, I want you to check those of Ambler and Ironish descent for any special magical effects on them." I pointed.

Twilight: "Oh! Of course. I didn't think of that.." She paced over to Gaze. "Gaze, you've been with us since the beginning - why are you scared like this?" Her horn glowed.

Gaze: "I-I-I.." He slunk down, and shivered. "..issa.." He lowered his head. "..dunno, Twi. Jes' - ever-time I think'a the Green Mare.. I gits so.. so scared.. can't.. I can't think!"

Lyra: "AYE! SAEM!" She sounded very distressed - Bon-Bon was brushing her hair as best she could, to try and calm her.

Twilight: "Yeah, he's.. there's something here, K. Something only affecting those who's bloodlines would be under the control of the Crown of Ambleon." She nodded.

K: "It's a targeted thing." I shrugged. "Alright. Norfy? Cosmic?" I pointed. "Get them out of here."

Broken: "S-Sorry, K.." He was quivering.

K: "No, it's not your fault." I pointed to him. "Do not feel guilty, Broken." And nodded. "Listen to Norfy and Cosmic."

Norfy: "I'll take care of them, K." He shrugged. "How far?"

K: "Get them and the Home Guardsponies to town. And keep them there until we figure this out." I gestured. "Rest of you - guns probably aren't going to work, here."

Norfy: "Right. All of you! COME WITH ME! Let's GO!" He gestured out the doors, and they all departed - the tied-up Home Guardspony was over another Guardspony's back.

There went some of my bravest, smartest ponies, too. Whatever the Green Mare was, I was going to make them pay for terrorizing my friends.

Rarity: "I'm going, too. This is no place for a pregnant mare." She kissed Dusk on the cheek. "Show them how brave my husband is, darling." And she flicked her tail up under his jaw as she left.

Dusk: "O-Of course!" He blushed.

K: "Mind on the matter, Dusk. What's good medicine for ghosts, Twilight?" I nodded to her. "Dancer? Anyone?" I looked around.

Moon Dancer: "I'm not.. completely sure." She shrugged.

Twilight: "I didn't study ghost bu-" She was cut off by Rose Pompadour.

Rose: "Laughter!" She beamed a grin.

Toola: "Well, yes, but K means a weapon. In case laughter doesn't work." She smirked.

Rapid Bearing: "Cold Iron." He stepped forwards. "Iron forged cold - or at a very low temperature." He shrugged.

K: "How.. do you do that?" I cocked a brow.

Rapid Bearing: "I have no idea. I just know that one Site that I worked before the war, the boundary markers were Cold Iron spikes. I asked why, and it turns out, the land was thought to be a graveyard at one point. We did find a couple of Pony skeletons - pieces of them. Come to think of it, I wager they're from several thousand years ago." He wagged a hoof at me, then lighting his pipe. "Anyway.. the property owners were Unicorns, and they insisted the boundary markers be Cold Iron, to prevent the spirits of the dead from rising and interfering with construction, or harming them after they moved in. They were pretty adamant about it. I figure.." He trailed off.

K: "No, no, that makes sense. Cold Iron has a place in human folk lore, too. Usually as an anti-fey or anti-magic metal. I guess.. it works on ghosts, too?" I shrugged.

Dusty: "We can find out." She nodded. "We just need some Cold Iron." And shrugged.

Katrina: "I can identify it, if we find it." She shook her head. "I have to admit, though, it's usually easier to help ghosts cross over to the afterlife, if possible."

Jade: "Seconding that." She nodded.

Dex: "Well.." He started in, pacing up, and handing me a guitar pick. "..I have this."

I held it in my hand and examined it. Katrina came over and gently touched it. She nodded.

K: "Good one, Dex." I shrugged. "It's something."

Vy: "Mmm. He's carried that in his pocket since before we started dating." She smiled.

K: "Mmm." I motioned. "Teams. Start scouring this place. She's gone to ground now that the Ambleonians are gone. Unicorn or other magic user in each group." I wagged a finger. "Find her." I looked at Chemical Lens. "YOU go to town and figure out what's going on here. Question everyone."

Chemical Lens: "Of course." She cocked a brow, and shrugged. "At the very least, I should be able to find something about how to banish, send, or seal her." She looked at her husband. "Come along."

Wide Lens: "Coming." He nodded. "We'll be in touch - TAC-3."

K: "Right." I nodded. "Well.." I looked at my so-called 'harem'. "I think we make a team, here."

Applejack: "Sure do, hun." She clicked her tongue. "Come on, everypony." And SHE led the way.

Mmm.. my dear wife was rather enjoying playing Boss Bitch of the group. I didn't object.

Now, we needed to find this ghost, and find a way to.. DEAL with it. Seal it, cross it over, destroy it, whatever. The last thing we needed was something like this, potentially being used by Tirek (if it wasn't already) to cause troubles.

I had no idea what I was really getting into. Again.

Part 4: Zoinks!

TIME: 00:42 GMT
DATE: War Day 990/21 Lunaris, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Cirencester Manor, Gloucestershire, Ambleon


Well, now we were on a ghost hunt, in a quaint 244-room manor house in the Ambleonian countryside. Cirencester Manor was an amalgamation of every "English-y Manor House-slash-Castle-looking-thing" in that it had a proper mansion building, but that was attached to a very castle-like "Keep" in the center. Much of the manor house was dedicated to a collection of old, local artifacts. It had enough bedrooms for CAG, again, as I said, as long as the married couples doubled up.

The architecture is exactly what you'd expect. On Earth, it had clear Tudor influence, and was very secure. The stone wall around it wasn't a proper castle wall with a walking path on top, but more like a really thick fence. It did have parapets at the corners, and proper towers covering the entrance with a gate. It was defensible, if necessary, but not highly secure. A concerted effort by medieval or Renaissance infantry, could assault this place, and expect to win.

The interior, these days, had been updated to be used as a Royal retreat. Lots of lavish carpets and tapestries and things were added, along with a proper kitchen and larder to store supplies. The Royal Family, however, hadn't used this place in 22 years.

In addition to this, it had a darker side - there was a dungeon below. A proper fantasy dungeon with some spooky additions and decorations that would be properly out of place in a cartoon universe, such as a pony-shaped Iron Maiden.

Oh, yeah, we took the Dungeon.

Applejack: "These universal laws're really something." She frowned, poking the Iron Maiden. "Yew called it, honeybun."

Steela: "Is shame this place is abandoned as it is. Would be fun display for museum!" She beamed a grin.

Sunset: "Yeah. If this Iron Maiden wasn't.. 'Made in Germaneigh, 998 C.S.' like it was. Look, manufacturer's date stamp and everything. This sucker's practically brand new." She snorted. "The chains hanging off the wall are fakes, too - cheap pot metal."

K: "And it only LOOKS old." I shrugged. "I'm betting someone bought it and stuck it down here because they thought it looked right - as in, those Universal Laws kinda influenced a purchasing decision." I nodded. "Just because the Laws are in play, doesn't mean they didn't get enforced until recently." I shook my head. "This being the world that it is, all kinds of influences are at play, here. Some so-called Laws, we've seen, can both be circumvented, or don't apply."

Dusty: "And we have our own unique ones." She pointed out, wagging a hoof at us. "Such as Ponies being generally more positive, kinder creatures than.."

K: "Humans. I mean, I'm not going to deny it. I'm much better, now, that I'm here. But, I'm still Human." I shrugged.

Applejack: "Mhm." She slid up to me, and nuzzled gently. "Anyhow.." She paced away, to examine one of the cells. "..this whole Dungeon, here.. start'n t'feel like somethin' Flim 'n Flam'd set up as a Nightmare Night house." She nodded.

Dusty: "Oh, I agree. This is feeling very.. fakey." She shrugged.

Sunset: "Almost like it was intentionally set up this way.." She trailed off.

Steela: "As though someone wanted fear. And appearance of danger." She nodded.

Applejack: "An' th' only reasons t'do that.." She leaned in.

Dusty: "..money." She nodded.

Steela: "Mmm. Is still it in fashion to scare people away, so one can claim lands?" She tilted her head.

Sunset and I both looked at each other, and smiled. Then laughed.

K: "IT CAN'T BE!" I pointed at her.

Sunset: "YOU WANNA BET!?" She pointed back, with a wing.

K: "Oh, if it is.." I shook my head.

Sunset: "Zoinks, gang." She smirked. "I guess that makes you Fred?"

K: "And you're clearly Daphne." I nodded, smirking, brow cocked.

We both looked at Dusty, Steela, and AJ.

Sunset: "Scooby." She pointed at Steela. "Shaggy." And Applejack. "And Velma." She pointed at Dusty.

Applejack: "WHO're YOU call'n SHAGGY?" She cocked a brow and leaned in.

K: "Scooby Doo. We're in a this-universe version of a Scooby Doo episode. Crossover. We're in a haunted mansion, supposedly, surrounded by evidence of fakery. And someone is using magic to make it more real, but no one's been hurt, really." I shrugged.

Sunset: "It just fits too well." She shook her head, then pulled the other girls aside to explain Scooby Doo.. which started a bit of a disagreement between Dusty and AJ over who was who.. until Sunset pointed out that Velma and Shaggy are often shipped together.

K: C> "All Callsigns. Every team but mine - evac to the town. I want no questions." I nodded. "If we're right.." I wagged a finger at Sunset.

Dusk: C> "Are you sure, K?" He wanted confirmation - as any good Second in Command would.

K: C> "One hundred percent. Go back to the town, meet up with the evacuated personnel, do not discuss anything related to this. Understood?"

Dusk: C> "Acknowledged."

Sunset: "We give 'em about.. fifteen minutes?" She shrugged.

K: "About that, yeah." I nodded. "Watch, I'll bet half the artifacts in the collection have been stolen, too. And replaced with imitations."

Applejack: "..so, yer sayin' - this is all a scam?" She tilted her head.

K: "I am wagering that it is, yes." I slung my Grant back from around my shoulder and chambered a round. "If it is, this'll work on the so-called Ghost." I lifted it, and looked at the flash hider, then lowered it, making sure the Safety was on. "We shouldn't need them, though, if Sunset and I are correct." I nodded. "In anything Scooby Doo, the bad guys are just scam artists and thieves. They're never dangerous. They don't put up a real fight, they just try to scare people. And if they have access to a spell that works on Ambleonians, it fits too well - it scares them away. But, they SHOULD be the only ones around here. They weren't counting on CAG setting up shop." I nodded.

Sunset: "Hm." She nodded. "A little Alicorn magic should be enough to restrain them." She looked at Dusty. "Or some Las Pegasus flank-kicking." And smirked. "Originally, Velma was a black belt in several Martial Arts."

Dusty: "Is that so..?" She smirked and leaned in a bit. "Maybe being labeled as Velma, isn't so bad?" And smiled.

I was sure that, after the war, if Sunset stayed here, she'd be surrounded by close friends. No matter what.

We waited a bit longer, then went back up stairs. Quietly, this time. Dusty passed out rubber over-hoofs for the girls, so their hooves wouldn't clop on the stone floors. And we started sneaking around.

Sunset: (Whisper) "So, are we going to trap them, or what?"

K: (Whisper) "If this is indeed just thieves, we'll just present ourselves and make it clear the jig is up."

244 rooms.. we went right for the Gallery Rooms and started nosing around. It didn't take long, either...

Dusty: "..yeah, these swords are cheap fakes." She poked one with her hoof. "Cheap castings." She nodded. "I've seen my share in magic acts in Las Pegasus, before."

Steela: "Ja. Und I have wielded many blades. These are all fakes, indeed." She snorted.

Applejack: "Ah ain't no expert on gems lahk Rarity, but ah'kn tell fake gold when I sees it." She pointed to a display case showing off supposedly gold artifacts.

We did a quick inventory of this gallery, and the next one over. We discovered that about 80% of the collection in these two areas was replaced by barely-convincing fakery. Even the suits of armor were replaced with cheap copies.

Whoever was behind this was systematically stripping the place bare. There was plenty of good stuff left, especially the jewelry in the main area of the collection - we surmised that they'd be going after this, tonight, and then leaving the area. They'd have to know that with CAG around, the replacements would be found out.

And at the same time, they needed ONE big score, to ensure their financial stability.. they needed the stuff from the main collection. Scaring us off was the first step.

K: "I think we have our confirmation. Now, to find the so-called ghost." I nodded. "We need bait."

Everyone looked at each other, and smiled.


TIME: 01:22 GMT


Broken: "Y-You're absolutely sure about this?!" He was terrified, but it wasn't the magical effect - this was his own mind, at this point.

Sunset: "You'll be fine." She nodded. "Just pretend you're coming back for the rest of our gear. Poke around. We'll be out of sight, behind you, at all times."

K: "We picked you because you're the.. you look the most easily scared." I shrugged. "It's the glasses." I nodded to Magellan. "Keep him from freaking out - you don't seem to be affected.

Magellan: *CHIRP!* He saluted.

K: "And consider yourself a Corporal, Magellan. You're doing a job - I have to legally recruit and pay you." I smirked a bit. "Two worms a week?"

He leaned over and gave me a look.

K: "Three worms." I nodded back. "And two slices of bacon."

Magellan: *Chirpy!* He extended his wing, and we shook on it.

Time to lay our trap.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Jinkies!

TIME: 01:43 GMT
DATE: War Day 990/21 Lunaris, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Cirencester Manor, Gloucestershire, Ambleon


I kinda felt bad for Broken Dawn. He wasn't used to this, yet. Not quite. He was getting there, though, and this was certainly a good wake-up call. I didn't pick Golden Wattle because, I had a strong feeling, that if he felt he had to, he'd do something off script. He was a fluffy, sensitive pony, like Broken, but he had that edge to him that would - and had - taken leadership and stood tall in the face of danger.

He was a risk taker. Broken was more conservative.

Broken also looked more.. ehh.. easily scared? I mean, I knew Broken could be very brave when the need arose, but there's a difference between that and going hog wild at the wrong moment.

No, I needed a pony that would absolutely follow the script.

Broken was going from room to room with a pull-cart, gathering the things we'd left behind. He took his time, going slowly, grabbing each item one at a time, examining it, and getting it in his cart. Magellan was flitting about casually, almost lazily, but he was keeping an eye on everything.

We were hidden. My Mare Team and I. Just out of sight, out of reach, and well within response distance.

We needed the Ghost to come out and cast her spell on him, to scare him. We figured it had some kind of range to it. Sunset estimated 15 meters tops for line-of-sight, and 5 meters without. That would put it at the upper limit of such spells for an average Unicorn.

The one thing we DID know: This was not Tirek's doing. This had greed and thievery painted all over it. Fortunately, this meant violence wouldn't be severe.

It took the better part of an hour for the theatrics to start.

*Loud, mournful wail*

Magellan: *CHIRP-Chirp!* He flitted to Broken's shoulder.

Broken: "Oohhhhh..." He whined. "..be brave, old man. Be brave." He gritted his teeth and.. ignored the sound at first. He was gathering Rarity's clothes up, from the dresser. "No such things as ghosts! No such things as ghosts!" He repeated to himself, almost trance-like.

Off in the distance, we were set up and waiting. He had his comm unit on, channel open, mic set to transmit. We could hear what he was saying.

Sunset: (Whisper) "Any second now.."

K: (Whisper) "Remember, if this is a fakery, I want them alive."

*LOOOOOOUUUUD, mournful wail!*

It was getting closer.. and finally, we could see it, up the hall from what WAS Dusk and Rarity's room.

It was a mare, alright, in what looked like a green dress. It looked ethereal. Wispy. Just as we expected. According to Sunset, such simple spells like this would be no problem for a Mage so trained. Illusions, is all it was.

Right on cue, Broken detached from the cart, and dashed out into the hallway, with Magellan on his shoulder. He spotted the Green Mare.. and I could see a mystical 'cloud' scoot away from the Mare and hit Broken.

He instantly became terrified.

Broken: "OOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHH! NOO, THE GREEN MARE! I GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE!!" He scrambled, fell, scrambled desperately, whinnied, whined, and finally got enough purchase on the ground to RUN.

Magellan was.. kinda trying not to laugh at this, as it WAS rather comic.. but he played along and followed.

Right past us.

We let Broken go - once he was out of range of the spell effect, it'd die down, and Magellan was there to calm him, when it did. Broken left. He got down the stairs, and out the front door, so fast, that if the doors had not opened, he would have simply flown THROUGH them, and left an outline.

Perfect. Now, what the ghost gonna do?

"Float" over to Broken's cart in the hallway, and start examining the goods.

Now, to spring the trap.

Sunset and I stepped out, and raised our rifles.

K: "Funny that a Ghost would be so interested in robbing." I said, flicking the safety off.

The ghost looked up at us, and tried her magic trick again.

It didn't work.

Sunset flared her wings out.. as if to say 'Bitch, plz. I'm an alicorn, you're a chump.'

The ghost gasped aloud, and turned, running up the hallway a few steps.

Steela and Dusty were right there.

Dusty: "STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM! IN THE NAME OF THE LAW!" She snapped her expanding baton out, and rolled her neck a bit, grinning. "LPMG! YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!"

The Ghost, then, turned, and tried to run into the bedroom.

Applejack: "YEW GIT DOWN ON TH' GROUND, BITCH! OR AH'MA TAKE YER HEAD OFF!" She paced out, with her Chaffee raised.

K: "LET ME SEE YOUR HOOVES! HOOVES! FORELEGS UP!" I said, not having moved from my position, as she backed out into the hallway.

Finally, the ghost complied, raising its hooves in the air.

Sunset: "Hah! Just like we planned it." She smirked, levitating her Grant in the air, so she could get close.

We all closed in on her.

Applejack: "Yew twitch that horn, sister, yew lose it." She snarled.

I grabbed the ghost's cloak, and pulled it off her head. This revealed a tan Unicorn mare of about 20, with curly red locks, and green eyes. She gave me the most doe-eyed expression I'd ever seen.

Someone else was calling the shots - this was no criminal mastermind.

K: "Who are you?" I asked, in a softer tone.

Mary: "Mah name's Mary." She shrugged. "Mary Spectra."

Dusty: "You're no ghost." She smirked.

Mary: "Aye." She sighed. "Ah'm sorry! Ah didn't have a choice!" She started tearing up.

K: "Who's behind all this?" I shrugged?"

Mary: "Och, ye'll never believe me! He.. he been robbin' this place fer.. fer th' last few years, t'cover 'is gamblin' debts!" She sniffled. "An' 'e's' got m'sister!" She stated with fear, as Broken came back in, now calmed down, with the spell effect worn off.

K: "Who is it." I stated, flatly. "I'll trust you, if you turn Crown Evidence."

Mary: "W-Well.." She sniffled..

TIME: 2:44 GMT
LOCATION: The Broken Smile Pub, Cirencester

We marched in, with Broken protectively guarding Mary. Everyone was here, as per my instructions. The pub was the largest building in town that was open at this hour.

K: "Ah, good." I said, nodding to those present.

Capt. Havastaff: "What IS this, General!?" He snorted.

Mary: "THAT'S THE ONE!" She pointed to Captain Havastaff.

Broken: "Golden! GIT THA' ROIGHT BASTARD!" He pointed as well.

Golden spear-tackled Captain Havastaff, and within moments, Dusty and Chemical Lens had joined in. He was.. uhh.. some Police Brutality in there, when Dusty thwacked his nuts with her Baton, but, he was soon tied up.

K: "You're under arrest. Assault on an NEIGHTO official, kidnapping, robbery, stealing property of The Crown..." I leaned in. "..and since it's during wartime, and you actively interfered with a CAG investigation.. treason." I smirked. "Where's Mary's sister?"

Capt. Havastaff: "AND WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU!?" He retorted, angrily, not denying the accusations.

Steela stepped over and gently placed a hoof by his nether regions.

Steela: "You die resisting arrest, otherwise. Is all CAG here. All friends. I am Valkyrie. Killing evil kidnapper and thief? Very noble act. Especially one who kidnap young filly." She growled, darkly. "I thinks Odin would cheer for me. What you thinks?"

He peed himself.

Capt. Havastaff: "B-Basement of my house! I-I didn't treat her harshly, I swear!" He tried to curl up, but couldn't, given the restraints.

K: "Excellent." I nodded. "Dusk, get the local Reeve. Cody, take Slapshot, Octavia, Vy, and Dex, go get the kidnap victim." I pointed.

So, we found our thief. And it turned out, there was A LOT MORE going on here, than we first thought!

Oh, and it looked to me like Broken.. might've found something more, here.. given that he was now comforting Mary over a pint of suds..
