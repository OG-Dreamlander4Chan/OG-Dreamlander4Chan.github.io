Part 1: Clipped Corners

TIME: 13:16 EET
DATE: War Day 1044/11 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Area Around Elati, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


Soarin had flown us out here. Once we arrived in the rear area, we borrowed two Kettenkrads from the Germanes, and loaded them with supplies. Driving a.. sort of a motorcycle.. was new to me, but I got used to the controls pretty quick. I noted they'd been adapted for pony use.

I was solo in mine. Dusk had both Trixie and Rarity. My Kettenkrad was loaded full with belted ammunition, water, and some rations. We were headed up to the forward command post of the 2nd (formerly Mechanized) Infantry Battalion.

As we slowed a bit, getting nearer the town, I signaled to stop.

Dusk: "What's up?" He lifted his goggles.

K: "Well, it's long past lunch, and we have another 20'ish kilometers to go. May as well eat before we get there." I shrugged.

Rarity: "K has a point, darlings. War cannot be fought well on empty stomachs." She tugged Trixie to come with her. "Come, come. I know your Domestic skills aren't the same - let me help."

Trixie: "Mmm.. going to make me a Great and Powerful Chef are you?" She stole a kiss.

Dusk.. cleared his throat a bit.

K: *HAHA!* "You lucky bugger." I leaned over and gently thumped his arm.

Dusk: "Well, I mean.." He caught a glance of them - Rarity assembling some firewood with magic telekinesis, Trixie gathering the lunch materials, both of them chatting and taking small bites at each other in a... more than friendly way. "..I suppose it takes a Guard of my skill to contain the chaos." He smirked.

K: "About damn time you took pride in your works." I patted him on the back as I dismounted.

Dusk: "Eh, well, I've come a long way myself." He shrugged. "Chief Altern." He grinned. "In just over four months."

K: "Advancements come quickly in wartime." I nodded.

Dusk: "I suppose so." He grinned a bit. "All kinds."

K: "All kinds indeed." I chuckled a bit, and took a sip from my canteen.

As I did, the chain for the cap came declasped and fell off. I bent over to pick it up, and the instant I did, a bullet skipped off the ground at an angle behind me. I went from grasping for the lid, to on my stomach, instantly.

Dusk: "Sniper!" He called out, somewhat matter-of-factly.

Rarity: "We figured, darling!" She was behind a large rock with Trixie.

K: "That came from almost straight ahead. Pull back." I pointed, as I slid back along the ground, and got behind the Kettenkrad.

Dusk got behind the other one, to an angle.

Dusk: "Don't suppose you saw it?" He nodded ahead of us.

K: "No, but I heard the whiz. No more than five degrees from dead center of me, and at that angle, they were going for the head. So, it's either an expert or a moron." I shrugged, reaching up to the saddle bag, and grabbing my Grant.

Dusk: "That was pure luck that that cap broke when it did." He grunted.

K: "I suppose." I shrugged, matter-of-factly. "Actually, I'm fairly certain one of the Vulpine Gods did that."

Dusk: "Oh? Watching out for you?" He smirked.

K: "Oh, yeah. A little nudge of things here and there isn't beyond their rules or capability." I leaned back to call out to Rarity. "YOU GOT 'EM?"

Rarity: "No, Darling! No shot! I'm not sure where they are!" She called back.

K: "Dusk?" I nodded to him.

Dusk: "Mmm." He had his Sherman-Spencer braced under the front wheel of his Kettenkrad. "Not sure. Couple of possibles. He might've moved, too."

K: "Alright." I nodded. "I'm sticking my head up - watch for movement. I'll force them to adjust." I motioned to Rarity that I was going to draw fire, and she nodded, her rifle braced, and ready. "Three... two.... one!"

I charged out from the Kettenkrad, knowing I wouldn't take fire as long as I was moving, if I was moving horizontally to the shooter (leading a running target isn't easy, especially if they zig-zag, like I was). I got behind a tree, got down low, and now that I was about 20 feet (~6 meters) from my Kettenkrad, if he was anywhere in front of me, he would have had to shift aim as I ran, or wait until I stopped.

I picked what I thought was a likely target for the Sniper to hide behind - a pile of discarded tree bits and small logs, 250 meters away - and primed a timed fuse grenade. I set my sights for 250, then suddenly whipped around the far side of the tree, and fired the grenade. The shell fired, arc'ed, and I actually watched it..

The shell hit, blew up exactly nothing of consequence..

..and still nothing.

Dusk: "He's not falling for it!" He called.

K: "I can see that." I called back.

Rarity: "What shall we do, then, darlings?" She called from behind us.

K: "Rares - any gems in the ground?" Time for a more.. magical.. solution.

Rarity: "Hm." She paused for a minute. "I have a good little cache, here, darling."

K: "Shield yourself and Trixie - and advance up to me!" I called back. "Trixie, get ready to rain down some magical death."

Trixie: "Oh, of COURSE!" She clapped her hooves. "Ready when you are, Co-wife." She playfully smacked Rarity's ass.

Rarity: "Oh, LATER.. darrrling." She giggled as she summoned the gems straight out of the ground.

Dusk was probably fighting a war boner right now. His Mares were flirting in the middle of battle - and, having been on his end of things a few times, I knew what that could do to a man.

Rarity summoned a gem shield, and used the broken angles of the gems to reflect the light all over the place, as she and Trixie advanced. In a nod to the practical, Trixie levitated her Merrill Commando Machine Gun and fired short bursts around the area.

Once they got over to me, I made room.

K: "No sign of the sniper. They might've taken ONE shot and withdrawn." I shrugged. "Either way, there's only... 14 places to hide, I figure." I got behind Trixie and manually pointed each one out. "..and there. Now, can you give each one a laser bolt from above?"

Trixie: "Hmpf!" She smirked, and patted my cheek. "Prepare to be amazed at The Great And Powerful Trixie."

She focused her energy, and levitated in the air a little. With one outstretched hoof, she summoned up a massive ball of red energy. From it, bolts of red started shooting out, one to each designated target, and created a magical explosion.

Out from the last one, 350 meters away, right before the bolt hit, a figure started running, covered in a cloak that had local branches and things stuck in it.

Dusk: "THERE!"

Rarity: "YES DARLING!"

They both raised up and fired rapid semi-automatic shots, it taking four total, until the fifth one hit the target in the flank area, causing them to drop their rifle, which rolled away from them. They got up, and started hobbling away.

K: "HOLD!" I called.

Trixie: "Heh. Want me to fry 'em?" She ribbed me. "Non-Lethal. Promise."

K: "Yeah, okay, STUN them." I wagged a finger at her.

Rarity: "..also, I believe that was my shot.." She rubbed her chin, admiringly.

Trixie raised up, paced better into view, and extended a hoof. A small lightning bolt shot out from it, hit the limping figure, and caused them to jump into the air with the shock (and for a second, flash, and show off their skeleton), then fall to the ground, stunned.

K: "Dusk." I indicated, and advanced.

Of course, he got there in about half the time I did, and already had the subject secured by the time I arrived. It was a Macedonkian in a camouflage uniform, and what can only be described as a Ghillie Suit.

K: "Impressive." I nodded.

Dusk: "Says his name is Postar Vodnik Jemiel Kastrutas, 121709." He nodded. "I'm guessing 'Postar Vodnik' is a rank, and the last bit is his service number."

K: "Name, rank, serial number." I knelt down next to him. "He speaks Equestrian?"

Dusk: "Enough to say that, at least." He shrugged.

K: "What unit are you with?" I asked, casually.

P.V. Kastrustas: "Nyema da vi ka?am nishto!" He spat the words back to me.

K: "I don't think he's going to say anything." I shrugged.

P.V. Kastrutas: "Oobi? mye ili mye poosti!! Nye sye sogulasoovam da bidam tvo? zatvoryenik!!" He tried to bite at me a bit, showing his aggression, then waggled his tied forelimbs at me, gave them a mean look, and shook his head.

K: "Er.." I shrugged.

Dusk: "I don't know, K. I don't think he likes being a P-O-W." He shrugged.

K: "Bring him back to the 'Krads. We'll call this in and see if we can get a translator." I shrugged. "I don't speak Macedonkian!"

Dusk: "Makes two of us." He shrugged back.

The prisoner was very.. resistant. We ended up dragging him on his flank, the whole way. He complained, too. Several shouts of 'Yebi sye!' and the like.

Rarity: "How's our prisoner?" She asked, looking him over. "Looks like a pro."

Dusk: "Given his personalized gear, and the condition of his rifle, I'd say so." He handed it to his First Wife.

Rarity: "Oh, my." She hefted it. "This is clearly a Herdiet SVK-M, but.. modified."

K: "It has an adjustable stock. Interesting." I looked at the Macedonkian. "He IS a bit larger than a Pony. Most of them were - it makes sense that the SVKM solid stock might not fit them well." I shrugged.

Rarity: "The markings are also not Roostian. Cyrillic, yes, but Macedonkian Cyrillic." She ejected the magazine and extracted a round from it with her horn telekinesis. "Soft pointed bullets, too, for more tissue damage. Goodness, darlings, he's positively deadly." She smirked, and reassembled the weapon.

K: "Huh." I looked at him, and started rifling his gear a bit. "Looks like he was set up for long range independent operations. Not much food, he probably eats grass.." I leaned in and forced his mouth open to smell his breath (he tried to spit at me, but his mouth was too dry), and nodded. "Yep, grass."

Trixie: "Do you think he was sent to kill YOU, specifically?" She tilted her head at him, and scrunched her nose up. "He needs a bath - at least a week since he's had one."

K: "No, but he saw me, and saw a chance to be a big hero." I shrugged.

Dusk: "I got someone back in Athens that can translate what he's saying." He raised the mic from the radio pack on his Kettenkrad.

K: "Alright. Translate what he's saying." I shrugged.

Athens Comsfox: C> "Zatvoryenik. Shto pravish?"

P.V. Kastrutas: "Nye sye sogulasoovam da bidam voyen zarobyenik! Oobi? mye ili mye oslobodi!"

Athens Comsfox: C> "He says he does not consent to being a P-O-W, and demands you kill or release him."

K: "Interesting." I shrugged. "Well.. I'm not that cruel." I looked at Dusk. "Kill him with Kindness?"

Dusk: "Sounds good to me." He shrugged. "A hungry belly that hasn't eaten good in a while is a good motivator."

Rarity: "Indeed, darlings." She finished bandaging the prisoner's wound. "He's as patched as I can get him." She nudged Trixie. "If you're going to be our Mareiage Partner, you'll have to learn some first aid for the foals. They WILL get into mischief." She smiled a bit. "Sweetie Belle certainly did."

Trixie: "Huh. Probably a good idea." She nodded.

K: "Is that what you call it? Mareiage Partners?" I looked at them all.

Dusk: "That's one term. You know some of the others - First Mare, Leading Mare, and so on. But if you're all married, then it's wife and wife, or together, Mareiage Partners." He nodded.

Trixie: "Mhmmmmm." She smirked, and went back to tending the fire for lunch. "And when we DO get married, that's what I'll be." She flicked her mane.

Rarity: "Indeed, Darling." She batted her eyes at Dusk. "Admit it, watching me expertly examine that weapon excited you." She gave him a very bedroom grin.

P.V. Kastrutas: "Viye ponitata stye koorvi." He said, looking away.

We totally ignored him.

Dusk: "Oh.. yeah." He grinned at her. "There's something to be said for watching one's mare take an interest in his hobbies, like that." He leaned in a bit.

K: *A-hem* "So, I have berries for the ration oats." I dug out my backpack and went to where Trixie was.

Oh, my. This was going to be an interesting road trip..

[End of Part 1]

Part 2: Unsweet Treat

TIME: 13:40 EET
DATE: War Day 1044/11 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Area Around Elati, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


We sat. Ration oats with berries, tea, some jerky for me, and a little something from our Vulpine friends - tinned cupcakes. In a thin tin was a cupcake, with the frosting in the center. The tin was watertight, the 'cake' nutritionally fortified, and the ration piece guaranteed edible for ten years. The filling was a simple buttercream-like thing with different flavors injected. I rolled blueberry.

I set a bowl of oats by the prisoner, along with water, and a tinned cupcake.

He stared at it as we ate.

Dusk: "He's lookin' awful hard at that food." He said, looking down at his tea.

K: "He is." I nodded. "He's hungry. Sick of grass. A touch dehydrated. And we're over here not stomping his bones into the dirt. He's confused. Probably got all kinds of propaganda about us." I sipped the tea.

Rarity: "Indeed, darlings. Even in war - ESPECIALLY in war - we must show kindness, generosity, and friendship." She nodded sagely, and sipped her mug.

Trixie: "Good point." She blinked. "I mean, considering ME.." She shrugged.

P.V. Kastrutas: "..I.." He looked down and away, blushing. "..no fight." His belly growled.

K: "Dusk, cover me." I got up immediately, as Dusk kept his rifle low, but held. "Hungry?" I asked, softly.

P.V. Kastrutas: "Jyes." He looked ashamed.

K: "I'm going to loosen your binds. Eat up. Don't try anything." I warned.

P.V. Kastrutas: "Jyes." He nodded.

I did so, and he ate rather.. eagerly. I could tell he hadn't had a square meal in some time. He also drank the whole cup of water - and two refills. We even gave him a spot of tea, which he thanked us for.

He went silent, but became very compliant otherwise.

I slid back over by Dusk as the girls cleaned up the little cooking area.

Dusk: "Called it." He nodded. "Heh.. would a human have broken that fast?"

K: "I don't know. He's some kind of elite soldier, and our elite soldiers are usually trained with all kinds of deprivations in mind - from lack of food, to lack fo sleep, to eating insects for protein if we have to. But, humans, especially humans like that, USUALLY.. would rather die than cave in." I shrugged. "Humans are like that - we hold to ideals even above the health of our own bodie-"

Everyone was staring at me.

K: *Ah-HEH!* "Guilty." I sheepishly raised a hand.

Trixie: "He's REAL bad, isn't he?" She looked to Rarity.

Rarity: "Indeed. My first time finding out, I was drunk, and you attacked Marelin. He was ready to die to protect me, by jumping out a second story window, and wrapping himself around me." She smiled a bit.

Trixie: "Oh, really?" She blinked, and looked over at me. "Everyone keeps telling me what you do.. now, I have to be better." She gave me a smirk.

Dusk: "Well, I'm glad neither of you died." He shrugged.

I stood up. Looking out over the plains, I could see dark clouds moving in.

K: "...Trixie." I pointed to them.

Trixie: "Mh." She rose and stared at the clouds for a bit. "It's not magic. That's real weather - real BAD weather." She frowned.

K: C> "Alpha Actual to Two Victor India." I grabbed the mic from the Kettenkrad.

2nd Vulpine Inf. Div. Comsfox: C> "We read, Actual."

K: C> "Bad weather incoming. We're about 24 klicks from the rendesvouz site. We're seeking shelter. Will advise."

2VID Comsfox: C> "Roger that, Actual."

Rarity: "A good idea, darling." She shrugged. "How far is it to the town?"

Dusk: "About the same distance. That storm'll be on us pretty fast." He rubbed his chin. "And with these plains, there's no real shelter."

Trixie: "We better find some." She shrugged.

Rarity: "I shall ride with K. Trixie, darling, make sure our guest is comfortable." She nodded as we got loaded up.

I did not expect her to straddle behind me, however.

Rarity: "Probably the last time I'll do something like this, K, Darling." She said, hugging my torso. "I cannot deny that you are so dear a friend to me, now, that this does absolutely nothing for a lady's libido." She said quietly.

Dusk: "Alright, ready." He nodded.

We started our Krads and started moving. About five minutes into the trip, we saw a busted up road sign, and a dirt trail. Looking down that trail, we could make out a manor house of some kind.

K: "I think that's our best bet." I nodded.

Dusk: "Agreed." He shrugged.

We headed for it. It didn't take but another five minutes to get there. The manor house was a mixture of European styles, but with a distinct Vulpine lean to the look. The rain hit us almost instantly. We got the Krads up under the eaves of the house, to keep them dry.

K: "Place seems abandoned." I said, dismounting, and pulling my Grant. "Mister Kastrutas?" I looked at the Prisoner.

P.V. Kastrutas: "No.. us.. here." He gestured to the house.

Dusk: "I think he means none of his comrades await us." He shrugged.

Rarity: "Indeed, darling." She grabbed her Sherman-Spencer, but also grabbed her silenced Ridgway and a pouch of magazines for it.

I took the lead as we got to the front door. I put my hand to it, and felt... well, nothing odd. So, I knocked loudly. Just in case. With no answer after several knocks, I tested the door handles. They weren't locked, so, I just opened them and entered. Just in case, I was in a tactical walk, with my Grant up and aimed.

As expected, the interior was empty.

Dusk: "Hm.. seems safe enough." He shrugged.

P.V. Kastrutas: "Iz creepz." He snorted.

Rarity: "I am, indeed, getting a bit of a vibe, here, darlings. But, any port in a storm." She shrugged. "And we've QUITE the storm outside."

Trixie: "No kidding!" She pushed the doors shut, and paced in with us. "Huh. It IS a bit creepy in here." She shrugged. "Oh, well. Probably us not familiar with how they decorate around here." She shook her head, and made her way inside.

K: "Dusk. Stay with the prisoner. Ladies, with me." I indicated.

Dusk: "Oh, I see." He smirked. "Trying to get my ladies all to yourself, huh?"

Trixie: "As if!" She snorted. "WE'RE engaged and HE'S married!" She flicked her tail under his chin as we moved off.

The three of us moved throughout the house. Many bedrooms, most of them decorated rather in a true Gothic manner, with a Vulpesylvanian tint - Gorgons of various description, with Gargoyles and things. The kitchen was stocked with food, and looked like the residents simply left. After a cursory inspection, we returned to the front foyer.

K: "Place is empty." I shrugged. "There's food in the kitchen."

Dusk: "The weather's getting worse, out there." He snorted. "Mister Kastrutas hasn't been disagreable at all." And shrugged.

K: "Well, let's make ourselves comfortable." I shrugged, and went over to the large fireplace, and started stacking it. Back log in first, and the rest all arranged. I lit it with my lighter. "This place should be fine."

Rarity: "Indeed, darlings. It IS rather cozy." She batted her eyes at Dusk. "Almost romantic. I wonder if they rent the place out? We should see about that after the war..." And wiggled her brows at the two of them.

K: "You do that." I nodded. "Probably some good wineries around here. Greek wine is nothing to shake a stick at - it doesn't have the complexity of Prench wines, but it has a very unique body and flavor."

Trixie: "How would YOU know? You don't drink!" She giggled.

K: "My grandmother was Greek." I nodded.

Dusk: "Makes sense." He shrugged, and lounged on one of the sofas, after making sure Kastrutas was comfortable.

We rested and gently chatted among ourselves. Even the prisoner was agreeable. He didn't really talk, but he didn't look angry or sullen. I kept stealing looks at him, to make sure.


TIME: 19:43 EET


After several hours, the weather wasn't letting up at all. I shrugged, and got up.

K: "I'm going to go to the kitchen and see about making dinner." I gestured to the others. "If you hear a gunshot, come running."

Dusk: "Mmmm.." He cocked a brow at me. "..if you think you'll be okay?"

K: "W-" I paused. "I'll take the chance." I shrugged.

So, I did. Into the kitchen I went, and I started assembling things to cook. I put some Equestrian Bit coins in one of the cabinets, to pay for the meal, next to some of the supplies I nicked.

I knew my pony friends wouldn't be big on meat, but there was a LOT of pasta, and a real wheel of Parmigiano here, so, I made (essentially) Noodles and Parmigiano Sauce. I added seasonings slowly. Garlic powder, onions finely minced, and I reached for the parsley flakes, taking it from the hand..

K: "Oh, thanks." I said, without thinking.

I didn't freeze up, though. I instantly fell backwards from the cooking stove, and drew my Dager pistol, as I landed on my back, in the slot between the counter on the wall, and the large island table. I aimed at where I'd been handed the Parsley, but there was nothing there.

I knew it wasn't my imagination.

K: C> "Dusk, get in here!" I said, not moving.

Dusk: C> "Right."

He was in the room in a flash, holding Rarity's Ridgway, and aiming around the room.

Dusk: "Room's clear, K." He said, as I got up.

K: "I was cooking, and someone handed me the parsley flakes right when I needed them." I shrugged, and went to finish the food. I mixed some minced and fried pork bits into mine.

Dusk: "Yep. And I'm not going to be the dummy that thinks you imagined it. At this point, I've seen too much." He accepted a bowl as we exited, him taking the rear, me watching the front, and we hurried to the others.

K: "Place's creeped up. Someone -handed- me something as I was cooking." I said, handing out the bowls, and loosening Kastrutas's binds.

Rarity: "Well, darlings, so much for the vacation." She snorted, but ate. "This is delicious, K." She nodded to me.

Kastrutas: "J'yes. Good. Thank." He nodded to me.

Dusk: "Still, we know something or someone is here." He said, eating rather quickly at first, but slowing down once he tasted it. "Yeah, this IS really good."

K: "I grew up eating a lot of pastas. My mom got into this Italian cooking thing right before I was born, and.." I shrugged. "..we sleep in shifts. I'll take first watch."

Trixie: "I'm glad YOU all are so calm about this!" She snorted, but wolfed down her food with measured appreciation. "I hope they're not dangerous."

K: "I left some leftovers in the pot." I nodded. "If they're chill, I left them something to eat. Even if they aren't, food is a great way to mend bridges."

Trixie: "Unless they're monsters." She made a small whinny.

K: "We'll see, huh?" I smirked, and finished eating, setting my bowl in the center of the table in the middle of the room, and drinking tea that Rarity made on the fire.

Rarity: "Oh, indeed, darlings." She shrugged. "Second watch, if no one objects?"

Dusk: "That's fine. I'll take last watch." He nodded.

Trixie: "I'm stuck with third? Eh, no matter." She shrugged, and rolled over in the loveseat she'd claimed, hugging her Merrill. "Anyone interrupts us gets lead and fire."

K: "Mmm." I smiled.

They turned in. I made sure Kastrutas had a blanket and could move around a little, though not TOO much (he was still a POW). They fell asleep very easily.

Me? I was sitting in a chair, off to the side of the fireplace, in the dark, Grant rifle across my lap, Beehive shell in the Gavin grenade launcher, and a fake "sleeping human" in front of the fireplace. The Sword of Rainbow's Light was next to me.

I stared out into the darkness, the wind and howling rain outside making quite the noise.

Something was here.

I didn't know what it was, but something was here.

I saw a whisp of blonde in the darkness, at the edge of the light, and faintly heard a pony hoof.

Brain gears turned.. clicked.. and it came up with an answer I didn't want to think about. These were Diomedes' Mares. They ate flesh. Literally, in this world, they were cannibals. They were supposed to be in Thrace, but I figured, with the occupation, they moved.

K: "...Xanthos." I said, calmly. "I saw you."

I stood up and walked calmly towards the edge of the light.

I'm thinking to myself 'Please be correct' - that they can't or won't eat me, because I'm not a Pony.

I was answered by a very tall mare's muzzle pressed under my hand, and a shaky voice.

Xanthos: "..you.. are not.. of us." She said, in a deep, mature, honey'd voice.

K: "I am human." I said, calmly.

Xanthos: "The.. food."

K: "You need something more meaty." I said, again, still calm.

Xanthos: "Y-Yes." She cleared her throat a bit. "But, I could feel the sword's magic. It.. it could strike me down."

K: "Come with me." I said, sliding my hand up her snout and to her neck, leading her away from the others, and back to the kitchen.

Xanthos: "They.. you.. they are your Herd." She said, her voice still very shaky.

K: "They are." I nodded.

When we got into the light of the kitchen, I could see her fully. She was slightly larger than Celestia, with a golden mane thaty flowed like waves, and a dark coat. Her eyes were blood red, with black pupils. Her demeanor was that of a Crack addict, needing a fix, but holding it together.

I went to the meat locker, and rifled through it until I came up with a hefty Salami. I set it on the table between us.

She nervously moved to it, and started eating voraciously. As she did, I got out a flank of Ox, and set that down for her as well. She ate it, bones and all. And finally calmed herself.

Without fear, I pulled up a stool and sat across from her - still keeping that hefty table between us.

K: "Tell me everything." I nodded to her, speaking softly.

Xanthos: "T-Tirek.. he.." She sat on her haunches. "We were turned to stone after an argument with the Gorgons over feeding rights in a valley in Thrace. A few months ago, Tirek came, and freed me. He holds my sisters' statues hostage. He sent me here to this area, knowing that war would come. He left me here as a trap. He didn't know you, specifically, would come here, but.." She gestured. "..he was sure if things went right, this manor house would be used as a headquarters. And I-I-I.. I could.. FEED." She breathed heavily. "I am sorry." She shrugged. "I crave the meat of a traitor." She looked at the ground. "A traitor's rule and a traitor's meat to calm the savage beast."

K: "Oh-ho?" I smirked a bit. "I think I have one in mind - the Ordained Knight that arranged this invasion for money." I nodded.

Xanthos: "Oh? This is her house. The Sharp Eye, yes?" She tilted her head.

K: "Yep, the same." I nodded. "We'll help rescue your sisters, I promise." I held my hand out.

She DESPERATELY slid her muzzle beneath it, almost moaning at the feeling of affection. She slid over to me, and basically rubbed against me.

I hugged her. She was so used to being hated - but she was a Pony at her core. She craved love. She craved friends.

Because.. Friendship is Magic.

Part 3: Thy Flesh Consumed

TIME: 21:01 EET
DATE: War Day 1044/11 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Manor near Elati, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


A mystical monster had been left as a trap in a large manor house owned by the disgraced traitor, the disgraced Ordained Knight Sienna Sharpeye. One who knew an invasion was in the offing. One who helped kill hundreds of Equestrian sailors and NEIGHTO troops. She worked with Tirek to put this individual here, hoping they'd EAT anyone who tried to use this building as their headquarters.

Something, I'm VERY sure, Sienna would have volunteered. 'Oh, here, use my family manor house as an HQ, it's near the front lines' - yeah, no. It could have easily eliminated a Division's command staff, and opened up a major hole in Vulpine lines, had it worked.

The monster? Xanthos, The Blonde. One of Diomedes' Mares. In this world, still a mare, and here, an eater of ponies. A cannibal driven by cursed bloodlust. The only thing that could render her "becalmed" permanently, is the flesh of a traitor. Which, really, if Tirek was ultimately behind that, it'd make sense - he'd have a perfect way to eliminate Sienna, AND remove Xanthos' enhanced "hunger powers" in one fell swoop, and eliminate her as well, or let the Vulpes do it.

This invasion was VERY WELL PLANNED, and that was becoming very clear to me.

I fed her Oxen. And that sated her burning hunger well enough for her to control herself without twitching like a drug addict needing a fix.

K: "Xanthos.." I gently rubbed her muzzle. "..I want to help you and your sisters. But until then, I need to make sure you don't hurt anyone. How long are you going to be able to maintain control?"

Xanthos: "A-Ah.." She pulled back from rubbing up on me a bit. "..a few hours, perhaps." She lowered her head. "Thank you, human. For wanting to help."

K: "My name is K----." I nodded to her.

Oh, did I mention she's touch-starved? Yeah, might've forgotten that. If I wasn't married, I'm sure we'd already be in the "middle" of something.

Xanthos: "K----." She nodded. "If you have some silk, you can tie my muzzle shut." She rubbed her head against me. "The silk will hold back the hunger and prevent me from hurting anyone."

K: "Done." I nodded. C> "Rarity! Wake up. I need a 1 meter length of silk cloth. I'm in the kitchen. Come in slowly and normally. I have everything under control."

Rarity: C> "Mm...h... yes, darling."

In short order, she came in, levitating a length of silk. She looked up at me, at the mare, then back to me, and sniffed the air.

Rarity: "Well, at least you didn't end up in the middle of this mare." She smirked, and levitated over the silk strip.

K: "Her name is Xanthos. She's one of Diomedes' Mares. A cannibal monster of Vulpine mythology. Tirek has her sisters captive - they were turned to stone in an argument with the Gorgons." I explained. "I've fed her some Oxen, so, she's relatively sane at the moment." I took the strip and pulled Xanthos to look me in the eye. "I promise you." I tapped my forehead to hers. "I will save your sisters." And gently tied the silk strip around her muzzle.

As soon as I did, the mystical forces took hold, and bound it to her. She sat on her haunches, and just laid her head in my lap.

K: "Get me the radio pack, Rares?" I nodded to her.

Rarity: "Of course, darling." She trotted off.

She came back in with the field pack radio, and set it down. I was brushing Xanthos' mane. She was calm, now, calmer still that her muzzle was tied shut.

K: C> "Selene Actual, this is Alpha. Come back."

Luna: C> "Selene Actual, my Alpha." There was a lilt to that.

K: C> "Can you teleport about 170km and take back a Mare of about equal size?"

Luna: C> *Slightly peeved* "I suppose, Alpha. I will need a beacon."

Rarity: "I think she thinks-" She giggled.

K: C> "Dusk is asleep."

Luna: C> "Oh, certainly. One moment. Selene Actual, out."

K: "She thinks I did something." I shrugged, smiling.

Xanthos was slowly dozing off. She finally felt safe enough to do so, probably for the first time in a while.

I heard Luna's magical poof sound from the other room, and she came trotting in. She, too, sniffed the air. Immediately. Before even looking.

Luna: "Well, MY General.." She slid over to me, then looked at Xanthos. "Aha." She nodded. "And wouldst this be Xanthos, then?" Because, of COURSE, she'd remember the legends at play here.

Xanthos nodded to her.

Luna: "I am Princess Luna." She bowed her head a bit. "This is mine." She slid a foreleg around me. "Second to his wife, of course."

Xanthos blushed a bit, and shook her head.

Luna: "Oh, alright!" She smiled. Then, she kissed me. Hard, and with hooves rubbing my chest. "We hope you're not putting yourself in too much danger." She rubbed her belly a bit. "Do remember, the Moon bears thine child." She was being extra 'old Equestrian' tonight - hormones, I was sure.

K: "Can you give her a lift back to Athens? And keep her guarded, so none of Tirek's boys try to free her and enrage her." I nodded, after the kiss.

Luna: "Of course, My General." She pecked my cheek, and took Xanthos' hoof in hers. "Come, come. The Night shall protect thee."

She stepped away, then poofed out.

K: "That was a very thorough kiss." I chuckled.

Rarity: "Oh, was it, darling? I hardly noticed." She giggled and pointed below my belt.

I had to hide my 'growing' shame.

K: "Ha-ha. Come on, you. Let's get some rest, hm?" I got up, munched one of the sausages hanging there, and followed Rarity back to the fireplace.

Dusk: "Everything okay?" He looked over at me.

K: "We were visited by a flesh-eating Mare named Xanthos. And she surrendered. We owe her the liberation of her sisters." I nodded. "Luna came and picked her up."

Dusk: "..explains the hard-on.." He muttered.

Rarity: "What was that, my darling?" She slid right up next to him, in front, and intentionally draped his foreleg over her.

Dusk: "Heh." He kissed her neck. "Nothing."

K: "Sleep. That's an order." I jokingly pointed at them.

They giggled/snickered, but got comfortable.

I didn't fully let my guard down, but even Kastrutas was absolutely dead asleep (and lightly snoring). I smiled at him - he was a tough Donk. He wasn't trying to fight us. He deserved honorable treatment. Maybe, in the future, Donkeys and NEIGHTO could be friends? I hoped so.


TIME: 03:11 EET

Third watch. Trixie was up, and drinking some tea. I was mostly asleep. Comfortable in the couch that was just slightly too small. Relaxing.. almost dreaming.. I could smell Luna's perfume, telling me I was about to have a good night.

Luna: "Mmm, there you are..."

She was in Human Form.

K: "Mmmmmmmmmmm..!" I made with the grabby hands. "There's my Princess of the Night!" Eyebrows wiggled.. I was about to dive in for a full course meal, when-

*GUNSHOT!*

I was ripped from the dream, hand to my Dager, I raised up, and aimed around the room.

K: "TRIXIE, TALK TO ME!" I called out.

Trixie: "Shadow Monster, K! It was about to eat your face!" She said, kicking Rarity's SMG to her.

Rarity and Dusk were up, and aiming weapons around the room.

Kastrutas: "Shto sye sloochoova!?" He jerked awake, too, and tried to scoot closer to the fire.

Dusk: "Shadow monsters?!" He said, looking around, and getting to a seated aiming position with his Sherman-Spencer.

Rarity: "We encountered them..." She shook her head. "...the day Pinkamena killed Trixie." She shrugged. "They can be shot, but magic is more effective. Trixie, darling, can you create a nice, thick shield?"

I was glad we had another magic expert with us. Really, Rarity had learned a LOT over the years.

Trixie: "Does a cow moo?" She shut her eyes, and summoned one up. Most of the Foyer was covered in it. She instantly gasped in pain. "AH!" And almost fell over.

Rarity was right there, holding her up.

Rarity: "They're hitting it, aren't they?" She aimed her weapon around.

One of them crawled out from under the sofa that Kastrutas was next to. I grabbed the sword, and HEAVED it at the beast, impaling it.

Kastrutas' reaction was immediate fear.

Kastrutas: "MOLAM! Nye sakam da mye ?adat malitye ?avoli na Tirek!" He scooted closer to me.

K: "Ahh.." I shrugged.

Kastrutas: "Vye molam vratyetye mi mo?ata pooshka! Sye kolnam vo mo?ot ?ivot dyeka nyema da tye povryedim! Samo ?avolitye!" He gestured to his weapon.

K: "Dusk?" I nodded to him.

Dusk: "...I'll drop him if he does anything." He nodded.

I kicked his rifle to him, as I called back the Sword. He gnawed through the ropes quickly, and came up with his weapon in the smae sort of seated aiming position Dusk was in.

Trixie: "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh! It's.. like.. dark burning spikes!! I-I.. I CAN'T HOLD THIS!" She was crying in pain.

Dusk: "Boss?!" He looked at me for orders.

K: "Shoot the darkness! Trixie, point to where they are! Point to the pain!" I ordered, getting off the couch and to one knee.

She did. Me, Dusk, and Kastrutas fired. Rarity was linking her magic to Trixie's, to help her keep the barrier up. I could hear the little bastards pop.

I moved over to our bags, and threw Kastrutas his magazine bandolier.

K: "BEEHIVE UP!" I raised up, and grabbed the Gavin trigger, then fired.

Lots of pops.

Trixie: "Ah! That's it!" She collapsed, and so did the shield. She was crying and rubbing her horn.

Rarity: "She's tapped, Darlings, and I haven't much left myself!" She one-armed her Ridgway, and held it out, protecting Trixie.

Dusk: "Any ideas?!" He got as close as he could to us.

K: "We need to kill whomever's controlling them." I nodded. "Dusk, get the fire up as much as possible - they don't do well in the light."

Dusk: "On it." He used his own horn magic to get more wood on the fire, and made it come alive with a little wind.

I could feel our dark adversaries back off a bit.

Now, to get the one controlling them.

Part 4: Inferno

TIME: 03:15 EET
DATE: War Day 1045/12 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Manor near Elati, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


We were in a mansion, and we were invaded by Shadow Monsters. The only one that had controlled them, had been Somnambula. But, she was on our side, now. Tirek could control these things directly, too, but I knew he wasn't here. Something else was. Some ONE else..

I held the Sword of Rainbow's Light up.

K: "Cover your eyes." I gave them a moment. "LUNA! GIVE ME STRENGTH!"

Magical Flashbang. Everything in the room that wasn't us, burst apart.

Dusk: "Question. Why not use that first?" He moved over to Trixie, and gently rubbed her back.

K: "I can only get one charge out of each Alicorn I have a connection with, per day." I shrugged. "I was hoping to save that, but.." I gestured with the sword. "..we were rather surrounded."

Rarity: "Indeed. Though, keep in mind, this benefit extends to all Alicorns we know - even Twilight." She nodded.

Dusk: "So, you have Celestia in reserve, and Cadence, Sombra, Twilight.. and Sunset, too?" He looked up, consoling Trixie.

K: "Yep. And calling them like that is like sending up a flare saying I'm in deep trouble." I nodded. "Luna probably just sent whatever she could, our way. She knows exactly where we are, but it'll be a bit before anyone gets here. In the meantime, we have to defend ourselves. And the best thing we can do THERE... is to find who's controlling this, and kill them."

Dusk: "Alright, makes sense." He shrugged. "Trix, can you stand?"

Trixie: "Egh." She forced herself to her hooves. "Y-Yeah. I can fight." She nodded, tears still streaming down her cheeks. "Dad was right.. I-I need practice." She shook her head. "Not enough stamina."

Dusk: "We'll help." He nodded.

Rarity: "Indeed, Mareiage Partner." She kissed Trixie tenderly.

Kastrutas: "Sè ooshtye koorvi!" He smiled, though, and chuckled.

K: "You. Follow me." I pointed to him, then myself.

Kastrutas: "J'yes!" He nodded firmly. Then paused, looked down at the Macedonkian patch on his uniform, and tore it off with his teeth. "Frend!"

Dusk: "Friend." He extended a hoof.

Kastrutas: "J'yes!" He chuckled, and shook hooves.

K: "Alright. Dusk, Trixie, Kastrutas. Rarity and Me." I pointed. "Dusk, if you have a Flashlight spell, that'll help keep them at the edge of your light ring." I looked to Rarity. "You good for a simple trick like that?"

Rarity: "Moreso, darling." She pulled her old Crystal flashlight from her bag, and extracted the crytalline matrix from within, and charged it with magic, making a nice light.

K: "Watch yourselves. You take the west, we'll take the east. Call out if you see the Big Bad." I nodded.

Dusk: "Got it." He shrugged, and pointed the way.

Kastrutas nodded, and moved off with him.

Rarity and I moved off to the other side of the house to start our search.

Rarity: "Do you think we can trust him, darling?" She said, levitating the light, but holding her Ridgway.

K: "Yeah. He doesn't want to get his soul eaten." I shrugged. "I think he figures, at this point, better to be a P-O-W with an intact soul, than become food."

Rarity: "Indeed, darling." She smiled a bit. "..we're still discussing names, you know."

K: "I hear." I nodded.. then paused and held up a fist. "Skittering. Left room." I pointed to the leftmost of two doors.

Rarity: "Covering you." She nodded to me.

I moved up to the door, and pulled out my own flashlight. Flicking it on, and one-handing my Grant, I opened it. Inside was a small bundle of those little Shadow Monsters. Rarity gunned them down effortlessly.

K: "At least I know that no foal is going to come to harm.." I smirked at her.

Rarity: "Indeeeeed, darling." She smirked, and changed mags. "I think Trixie is an excellent additon to my stable..." She cocked a brow as if to say, 'you don't think I see myself as the real Alpha here?'

K: "I'm looking forward to your family." I pointed, with the flashlight-hand.

*Low, seismic/rhythmic thrumming*

Rarity's face went from confidence, to these days unaccustomed fear. Her iris and pupil shrank, her eyes widened, and she slowly cowered to the ground, holding the Ridgway like it was no better than a pointy stick.

K: *Uncomfortable chuckle* "It's... it's ahh... RIGHT behind me, isn't it?"

Rarity nodded, very slightly quivering.

K: *Almost manic sarcasm* "I.. -REALLY- don't want to turn around, do I?"

Rarity shook her head 'no' and tried to back up, but fell over herself.

K: "Oh. Fun." I nodded.

I could feel it, now. Absolute paralyzing COLD FEAR. The very pit of my soul went ice cold. Even with everything I'd been through to this point, I was terrified, and it was my Monkey/Lizard Brain telling me to be. It had clubbed my human logic over the head and stuffed it in the freezer to shut it up.

K: "RUUUUUUUUUN AAAAAWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!"

I screamed at the top of my lungs, dropping my flashlight, and bolting in the most ungainly manner, but grabbign Rarity by the tail as I did so. At first, dragging her, then being dragged BY her as she got to her hooves, and GALLOPED AT FULL SPEED.

We ran across the foyer, and ran INTO Dusk, Trixie, and Kastrutas.

Rarity: "DarlingdarlingdarlingitsrightbehindusitshugenaditsblackanditsamassofhorrorandPLEASEDARLINGSAVEME-"

Dusk: "Settle down! Settle down!" He hugged her.

I fell on the floor, face down, and rolled over, staring back the way I came. Kastrutas himself came over and helped me up.

Kastrutas: "Beeeg.. darkness..." He gestured with his hooves. "Scare bad?"

K: "Yeah, dude. BAD." I got up with his help, and realized I had dropped my flashlight. "Dusk, light." I pointed back the way we came.

He directed his flashlight spell to the other side of the Foyer.. but... it was swallowed in darkness. We couldn't see the furniture over there at all.

Dusk: "...huh." He blinked. "I think I'm going to shit my pants."

I clawed for the Sword of Rainbow's Light.

K: "CELESTIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!! GIVE! ME! STRENGTH!!" I held it up and focused HARD, DESPERATELY wanting the BRIGHTEST AND HOTTEST Sun Flame to come out.

The whole room.. OUR side of the room.. lit up. The black mass at the other side, backed up a bit. But the mass didn't shrink from the light.. it advanced.

Kastrutas: "OH WE FUCK!" He shook his head.

K: "Not done. Not DONE!" I put everything I had into the Alicorn Call.. and only when it subsided, did I change tactics. "FIRE OF NIRIK!" I twirled the sword, and it became the Fire Lance of the Nirik.

Terror drove me to charge forwards with total abandon. I stabbed the Darkness, twirled and slashed the magical flames through it, and managed to 'gather' the dark curtain in the twirl, ripping it away from the one casting it.

The Lance lost power just as the Darkness was shredded into nothingness.

There.. stood.. a very deadly-looking female donkey. Shapely, in a slinky black dress, covered by a huge wollen coat with military decorations on it. She'd almost be sexy by pony standards, if it wasn't for the buck teeth. Even the black lipstick made her look kinda hot.

Kastrutas: "Ko? si ti?! Ko? tye isprati!?" He pointed at the other Donkey.

Female Donkey: "Tishina pryedavnik! Tvo?ata doosha kjye bidye mo?a za migu!" She looked at me. "De time of de Darkness comes, Hyooman." She narrowed her eyes, and held out a hoof.

Dusk raised his rifle and fired, but the bullet bounced off of her magical shield.

She was charging a major spell, even I could feel it.

We started backing up. I hefted the sword, feeling the effects of calling three Alicorns plus the Nirik power, starting to weigh on me. I didn't know if I'd stay conscious after calling another.

Kastrutas: "...nyo! NYO!" He grabbed all the hand grenades on my belt, and put his hoof on me. "FREND! Rem'ber Kastrutas!" He turend to face her, pulling ALL THE PINS AT ONCE. "UUUUUUUUURAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

He dove on her, tackled her, and all Dusk could do, was telekinetically pull us backwards through the door to the kitchen, and slam it shut.

There was an explosion.

Then silence.

The storm ceased.

Part 5: Morning Light

LOCATION: Manor near Elati, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


Eight Nash APC's pulled up, with two Royal Guard Tassigny's, and two Powells. Dusk's old unit poured out of the half-tracks, combat ready. Luna's Guard Company.

Steadholder Wispy Shadows: "DUSK!" She charged up to us, slinging her Grant Carbine behind her as she did. "General! We-"

The three of us were standing over a lump in the earth. Respectfully looking down at it. A grave stone, carved by Rarity, said simply "Our Friend Kastrutas. 1005 C.S."

Dusk: "GUARD COMPANY! ATTEN-HUH!" He ordered.

They all instantly snapped to attention, and looked at us.

K: "Our friend. Kastrutas. He gave his life for us. He started as an enemy. He became our friend. Let us never forget that even in the middle of a war, we can make friends, even from those that bear arms against us." I said, and saluted the grave. "Rest well in the eternal pastures, Kastrutas." I looked at the Guards. "At-ease!"

Rarity: "H-He was.." She sniffled. "..a nice stallion."

Trixie: "I wish we'd gotten to know him better." She blinked, sullen, and still in pain.

Dusk: "We got to know the most important part of him." He nodded to the grave, and held up a small lithograph of a female donkey and a foal. "He died for what was important." And stuck it inh is uniform shirt, before turning to Wispy. "Ma'am." He nodded to her.

Wispy: "Oh, Dusk." She sighed, and lowered her head. "I'm sorry we couldn't get here sooner."

Dusk: "It's not like it would've helped too much." He shrugged. "We either needed a Regiment or.." He looked at the grave. "..just us."

Wispy: "Still." *Sigh* "Can we at least escort you to the front, General? Dusk?" She looked at her old friend, and put a foreleg around him.

Nightlace: "We got your back, buddy." Nightlace came up, and hugged Dusk.

K: "Yeah. An escort would be nice." I nodded. "Come on."


TIME: 09:44 EET
LOCATION: Front Line, 3km south of Piloroí, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


We got off our Kettenkrads, and the Guards exited their vehicles. The Vulpines present cheered at our arrival. We accpeted hand shakes and hugs, as we passed out fresh supplies. I left everyoen behidn to go find the unit commander, Brigadier General Tan Linkletter.

In a dugout, piled with sandbags, was the wizened oler Fox. Orange coated, but with clear greying on his muzzle, he had a scar that ran along the edge of it.

K: "General Linkletter." I noded to him.

Gen. Linkletter: "General K." He nodded back to me.

K: "What's the situation?" I asked, looking over the map.

Gen. Linkletter: "Not good, General. They launched a fresh Brigade against us last night, and we nearly broke. We're low on everything." He shrugged. "Especially troops."

K: "I have one company of Elites." I nodded. "WISPY!" I called her. "DUSK! GET IN HERE!"

They both dashed in, and saluted General Linkletter.

K: "Wispy, your company is taking the front. It's been a while, but the Vulpes are low on everything, and your Company is fresh. Call back to Athens, and gather up EVERYTHING we can scrape together. I don't care what. Organize it into a unit and get it out here. We need to hold here and prepare for counter attack." I pointed at the map. "When we get reinforcements, we'll drive through here, and go for the Town." I looked at Linkletter. "What's the condition of the town?"

Gen. Linkletter: "Decent enough. It was given away without much fight. The Militia fell back with us." He shrugged.

K: "Alright." I nodded. "We'll take the town and hold it. If there's any civilians, we'll evacuate them as we advance. We'll use the town as a strong point, and advance from there. Piece by piece until we make a long bridgehead. Then, the next sector past us, does the same until we make a pincer, then we fold in. Double envelopment followed by envelopment, and so on. Scythes, until we get back to the border." I gestured. "This is the most important sector on the line, that's why I'm here."

Gen. Linkletter: "I see what you mean. If we can start making Pincers, we can get up to the low mountains here..." He pointed at the map. "..and here.." Another tap. "..in no time."

K: "If we're lucky, we can throw them out in a few weeks." I nodded to General Linkletter.

Gen. Linkletter: "Alright. Once the Reinforcements get here, I'll pull back my units one at a time and reorganize, regroup, and recommit." He gestured.

K: "Alright." I looked at Wispy. "Get me some troops." I looked at Dusk. "Get the company deployed."

Dusk: "Roger that, K." He nodded, and moved off.

Wispy: "Understood, General." She moved to her HQ vehicle, to get on the horn to Athens.

The absolute insanity of the last 48 hours taught me, indeed, sometimes you can turn an enemy into a friend. And sometimes those friends will be very dear to you.

But, the war must go on. We had to turn the enemy back and retake the land they'd invaded. Then, we could focus our attention on the next step - taking a 'vacation' and helping the Vulpines retake the lands stolen from them so long ago.

Kastrutas would be remembered as a friend. And as I always say...

..Friendship is Magic.
