Part 1: Flight of Friendship

TIME: 19:33 CET
DATE: War Day 1032/30 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Capital City, Hippogriffia


As I sat in the ruins of the palace's meeting room, I watched as the Engineers from Prance and Roam milled about, trying to clean things up. The troops from Graves Registration were recovering the skeletons of the dead. Bishop Ansaldo of Saint Gusty's Basilica in Rome was on site, and performing prayers for the dead. Despite not being saved by Celestia, most Hippogriffs were Celestians.

Queen Novo didn't even know how many hundreds of her people had died so long ago. We were estimating 4,000 in the capital alone. A couple of the smaller villages had been wiped out to a Hippon. Not one left alive. The clean-up was depressing, though. Unlike the recent dead in Neighpon, this one was worse, as the dead had been left out in the open in gross disrespect, for three decades.

Queen Novo: "..General?" She slid in, finally wearing an old dress of hers.

K: "Just K, Your Highness." I nodded to her, sliding my tea aside.

She slid over to me, a bit timidly at first, then leaned her head against my chest.

Queen Novo: "Then call me Novo." She nodded. "Does.. this pain.. ever get better?"

K: "No." I shrugged a bit. "Eventually, you forget about it. You get past it. But it never fully goes away."

I slid an arm around her - I could feel this kind of affection. She was another 'mommy' needing a 'daddy figure' to emotionally lean on. She was a lot like Celestia, in that regard. I felt her sigh, and relax, feeling safe.

Novo: "..whatever we can do to end this war." She said, finally. "So no other peoples have to deal with something like this."

K: "Then you have faith in me." I nodded.

Novo: "Of course." She smiled a bit. "You're the Human of Legend, after all." She nodded. "And I know you can do this - you saved my life, you saved our treasure. What more proof do I need?"

I smiled at that.

K: "I have a feeling, you'll get along well with a lot of other world leaders." I nodded to her.

She looked left and right a moment, but curled up in my lap - she was about the same size as a taller pony, so, this was a BIT oversized. She rest her head against my shoulder.

Novo: "My husband.. he.. died some time ago. Skystar was 2." She frowned. "He tried very hard to find a way for us to return to the surface."

K: "I'm so sorry." I frowned.

Novo: "He.. he was the best of us. He cared. He was older than me. Yes, the marriage was arranged, but we were socialized together from a young age. I did love him. Very much. He was my rock. Now, that he's gone, I have had to be my own rock." She let out a breath, and relaxed. "It's so nice to have a close friend, that can be my rock, to some extent. To relax, and lean on someone else, again, and be able to trust them."

She was emotionally relaxing and letting go.. for the first time in decades. I could feel her.. just.. feel comfortable, for once. It wasn't long before she fell asleep.

TIME: 23:44 CET

I had kinda dozed off, too. I mean, I was stuck under a furry creature, and the human instinct to relax was there. Despite the unforgiving stone I was perched on.

Applejack: "There ya'are, hun." She slid up, speaking in low tones, and put a blanket over the dozing queen. "Ever'thing's all quiet here, now." She nodded.

K: "Sure is." I nodded a tad to her. "She just fell asleep."

Applejack: "Aw, I figger'd." She smiled warmly at me. "Sometimes, what th' other mares want outta mah husband.. is jes' a lil' comfort." She nuzzled under my hand. "S'what makes'ya so attractive. Ain't just the fun parts, it's th' love y'all have for ever-one."

K: "Yeah." I nodded, smiling. "I care about all of them. And it hurts me that I know I can't protect them all."

Applejack: "Y'all'll figger it out." She smiled. "Best as y'can." She slid her knapsack saddle bags under my head. "I.." She looked down. "..know s'm friends ain't gonna make it back, either. But I know.." She reached her hoof out and traced my jaw with her hoof frog. "..y'all ain't gonna waste no lives. No senseless deaths. Not if'n'y'all can stop it."

She hopped up on the stone table, and made herself comfortable with another blanket, and a spare cushion from something. Staring at me as she got comfortable in a very horse-like position. Smiling as she shut her eyes.

K: "I want to live through this, Jackie. I want to come home with you and raise apples until I'm fit to be put out to pasture." I smiled back.

Applejack: "Me, too, hun." She beamed a sleepy grin. "Ah love you."

K: "I love you, too." I smiled back.

We dozed off together. Not snuggled up to each other, but together. As I slept, Luna came by and we talked. Both about what's been going on, and about the future. With her now with foal, the royal line had an heir apparent. But, the Princesses still wanted to step back and let ponies handle pony affairs. It was complex, and it was mostly about HER wanting me to come home for both Starlight Mint, and 'our' new foal.

Luna: "..and I want her to know her father well. Both of them." She giggled.

K: "Mmm.." I grinned widely. "..poor Dusk, I know Trixie wants to get all full of foal as soon as possible. Not to shirk duty, but to put one over on Rarity." I shrugged, resting my head on her (human form) thighs.

And for those of you wondering, yes, it's very similar to how her "Equestria Girls" form would look. Just.. uh.. a bit more full figured. Especially the front and back cushion zones.

She liked being fuller figured around me. Soft, comfortable, but still in a very pleasant shape.

Luna: "Mmmm." She smirked. "Maybe we'll see some very powerful mages arise from that line."

K: "Who knows?" I shrugged.

I didn't realize exactly who, or what, would arise from this. I had no idea how much I'd changed the future already.

Luna: "Mm. I am.. so glad to have this real opportunity to be a mother, my love." She nuzzled me (and despite the human form, did so very horselike). "It was always a dream of mine."

K: "Well. Only fitting that a princess of dreams, gets one of hers to come true, then, yeah?" I smiled.

Luna: "Indeed." She smiled, broadly. "We're still surprised Spike can summon Leviathan. I wonder whom else he'll be able to do that with? You know, Summoning magic was extinct until now."

K: "Was it? Interesting." I nodded, seeing the sun slowly start to rise - indicating that it was getting to be morning in my part of the world. "So, what can I expect from Jupiter?"

Luna: "I have no idea." She shrugged. "We've never had contact with other Pantheons. It just.. wasn't done." She smirked. "Until a certain human came along."

K: "Mmm. I'm changing so much around here." I shrugged. "Welp, about time for me to get up. I love you, Luna. See you soon!"

Luna: "Oh, ho-ho.. you presume to get away too soon, my love." Luna drizzled that out, bent down, and kissed me.

Part 2: Optimus Maximus

TIME: 11:33 CET
DATE: War Day 1036/4 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Capitoline Hill, City of Roam, Roaman Empire


Several days later, we went about the beginning of the next leg of our journey - finding the Roaman Old God Jupiter. While the VAST.. vast majority of Roamans were dedicated Celestians, and St. Gusty's Basilica in Sundance City was the European center of the Celestian religion.

After seeing how dedicated some of the Roaman troops were to Celestianism, I caught a glimpse of one reason she wanted to step back as soon as she was able. This level of adoration was.. something. I mean, it reflected the level of religious fervor for Catholicism in Earth's Rome, but being a LIVING Goddess.. yeah. Imagine having millions of followers that can all send you Instant Messages through prayer, all the time?

The temples on Capitoline Hill were largely abandoned, but not deserted. There were several Roaman Carabinieri guards that patrolled the area. We were sent to the area with Primo Capitano Cuore Pulsare of the Publica Aliquam. She was a light pink Pegasus pony, and married to a cousin of Gio's.

Cuore: "Up here, Generale." She nodded, as we ascended the last few steps.

Fluttershy: "This is all so amazing! I've never seen temples like this before!" She was absolutely glued to Golden's side.

Twilight: "I'm more interested to see all the history here.." She trailed off. "..it looks like ponies just stopped coming here. No defacing, no repurposing, nothing, they just left."

Moon Dancer: "Technically, that's exactly what happened. Jupiter and the Roaman Old Gods stopped being worshipped almost immediately after Celestia reunited the Pony Tribes a thousand years ago, and word of her power reached Roam and Europe." She nodded, as we paced into the large complex.

There were several temples.. but Jupiter's was the largest. There was also a smaller one dedicated to him, off to the side.

K: "Split up and look for clues." I nodded to them. "Spike, stay with me. I'm going right to the Head Office." I nodded to the largest temple.

Twilight: "I'll.. check that out, too.." She blinked, and looked at Spike. "And not because I'm going all Mommy on you again or something, but.. that's the most likely place to find something."

Spike: "It's okay, Mom." He smiled. "I get that you're trying to look out for me, and give me space at the same time." He hugged her.

Smolder: "I appreciate it, too." She smiled a bit.

I pulled out a large package of literal bribes for Jupiter. Two bottles of Veloce family wine, very old. A sack of their finest wine grapes. A gold hand-shaped lightning bolt. A bundle of dried cinnamon sticks. I hoped it was enough to at least get a message through.

Into the Temple I went, nodding to a couple of robed figures from the Cult of Jupiter that were hanging around. His statue was GIGANTIC.. at least 33 feet/10 meters tall. At the base was a large metallic bowl in which offerings could be placed.

I stepped up to it, and picked out a bottle of the wine.

K: "Jupiter, King of the Gods of Roam. I am K---- K---, a human! I present these offerings to you, and humbly beg for.. anything. A word, a direction, something. To speak with you of matters most grave." I held the wine bottle up, and uncorked it, pouring the contents into the large bowl.

To the surprise of exactly no one, the wine seemed to be "drank up" by the bowl as it was poured in. So, I poured another. Then, respectfully, laid the grapes in (which also vanished). Then the lightning bolt of gold. Then, the cinnamon sticks.

I saw each item vanish. I then fell to my knees before the bowl, and fixed by gaze on it. I didn't know what to expect.

And waited.


TIME: 13:12 CET

Almost two hours passed. Nothing. I refused to give up. I stayed on my knees, and stared at the bowl. Mind empty, letting the world pass me by.

Twilight, Spike, and Smolder had moved away in order to examine the rest of the Temple.

Old Monk: "..you've been'a there quite some time." He paced over, and knelt (got down on his horse knees/"loafed") next to me.

K: "I must speak with Jupiter." I nodded. "If I'm to save this world, it seems, a legend has said I need his help."

Old Monk: "Mmmm." He nodded. "I noticed the gifts you brought him."

K: "They represent all of NEIGHTO. The wine and grapes were from the Veloce family. The gold was from Germaneigh. The cinnamon from the Neigtherlands." I shrugged, still staring at the bowl.

Old Monk: "Mm. And nothing from you." He pointed out.

I looked at him, my stare finally broken. And.. I got it. I nodded.

K: "You're right. I came with gifts from my friends, but I offered nothing of my own." I shrugged. "I haven't really anything of my own that would be worthy, though."

Old Monk: "Some'a'time.. it's the thought that counts, si?" He smiled a bit.

I nodded, and reached into my tool pouch. I took out the lighter that I'd been carrying all these years, and held it up.

K: "God Jupiter. I realize I have offered nothing of myself. I humbly apologize. I offer you something personal to me - a lighter, gifted to me by my stepfather, as a recognition of my accomplishments in graduating college." I placed it into the bowl, at the edge, and let go of it. "I am not a wealthy person. I pray this offering, however, demonstrates my.. desire.. willingness to give up everything, to save this place."

The lighter, however, didn't vanish at first. After a moment, though, it seemed to slowly disappear under an invisible hand.

I remained kneeling.

Another five minutes passed, and something dropped from the statue's outstretched hoof, and landed in my hands. My lighter, wrapped in ancient paper.

I opened the package, and examined the paper.

"Dear Human,
While we appreciate your gifts and recognition, we are not here. You must ascend the mountain to meet us. You may need this. Interesting toy!"

K: "I.." I held it up, and looked over to the Old Monk.

But, he was gone. Like he was never there.

I smiled.

The Roaman Gods weren't what we had always thought they were - they were the GREEK (Vulpine) Gods in DISGUISE! And I was certain...

K: "Twilight?" I looked over to her.

Twilight: "Yes, K?" She tilted her head, trotting over.

K: "Was there an old monk talking to me just a moment ago?" I smirked, already knowing the answer.

Twilight: "Nope. You remained completely motionless for about two hours, then tossed your lighter into the bowl and apologized to Jupiter." She shrugged.

K: "I thought so." I smirked harder, and managed to get to my feet, stretching my legs. "Also, we're in the wrong place - we need to go to Mount Olympus!"

Twilight: "SERIOUSLY?! All this for nothing?!" She hissed.

Moon Dancer: "..I was about to say this." She shrugged, coming in. "I tried to appeal to Venus and I got the equivalent of a vacancy notice." She frowned.

K: C> "Alpha to Ares Actual." I raised my Comms.

Seven Devils: C> "Go, Alpha."

K: C> "Pack it in - we're heading to Athens!"

Seven Devils: C> "SERIOUSLY!? WOW! Aw'right! I get to show you MY home, now!"

K: C> "K to CAG - all callsigns. Reassemble at the naval port - we're in the wrong place. Staff meeting at 18:00." I looked to Twilight. "Come on. We've got work to do."

Part 3: A-G-N

TIME: 12:21 CET
DATE: War Day 1038/6 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Aboard VMS Prince Orlando, Agean Sea, 25nmi South of Attica, Vulpesylvanian Territorial Waters


It was just after lunch. Two days after meeting what I could only assume was Zeus, at the Temple of Jupiter in Roam. We realized that the Vulpine Old Gods, what I would call the Greek Gods, were actually disguised as the Roaman Gods. They were one and the same, just under different names.

This wasn't quite the same as Earth, but it was close enough.

Once we entered their territory, though, we knew it. Spike told us point-blank that he couldn't contact Leviathan any more. Meaning, we were in the hold of the God Poseidon.

I was out on the deck, next to the huge 15-inch gun turret. It was larger than most of its class, a bit larger than the ones from Roam. They used the same gun, barrel, and mechanisms, but the Vulpines designed the turrets to be larger, in case they wanted to mount a third gun barrel, or add some internal machinery for shell handling.

*Shoo.. beee... dooo...!*

K: "What the.." I could hear a song on the wind.

Vulpine Sailor: "GENERAL! PLUG YOUR EARS!" He called from the upper deck. "SIRENS!"

K: "Sirens!?" I cocked a brow at him.

*Shoo be do.. shoo-shoo-be doo..*

Vulpine Petty Officer: "SIRENS!" He ran to the sound powered phone. "ALL HANDS, COVER YOUR EARS! SEA SIRENS WARNING!"

K: "Sirens?!" I was STILL perplexed.

Seven Devils: "Sirens?" He came pacing out on to the deck. "Petty Officer, what's this?!" He swept a foreleg towards the sea.

Vulpine Petty Officer: "SIRENS, Lieutenant! They sway the souls of sailors, and send them careening into the rocks!" He sneered towards the sea. "Then, they consume the flesh of the living!" He spat on the deck. "VILE creatures!" He got a set of plugs into his ears. "GET THE RIFLES! CHARGE THE 11MM GUNS, PREPARE TO-"

K: "STAND DOWN!" I ordered.

Seven Devils: "Yeah, what the General said!" He snorted.

Several CAG members had come up on deck, including Dusk and Moon Dancer.

*Shoo-be-doo! Shoo-shoo be doooooo!*

The music was getting louder.

I walked to the edge of the deck, by the railing.

K: "I recognize that tone." I nodded. "Seven?" I cocked a brow at him.

Seven Devils: "Oh, so do I, K!" He smiled.

There was a splash to our port side. A SEA PONY!

K: "I DON'T BELEIVE IT!" I laughed.

Seven Devils: "Well, I'll be a Monkey's Uncle!" He beamed. "HEY, BUDDY!" He called to Havoc. "SEA PONIES!"

Vulpine Petty Officer: "WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?" He shouted, as Havoc came over.

Havoc: "I saw one!" He pointed at the water.

K: "I don't believe it!" I smiled.

One of them breached the surface, following alongside the ship.

Wavedancer: "HAVOC!? SEVEN!?"

Havoc & Seven: "WAVEDANCER?!"

K: "Hiya!" I waved to her.

Wavedancer: "OH! You must be K! Megan told u-"

Dusk: "K! LOOK OUT!"

I heard a gun shot, and felt myself get pushed to the ground. I heard signs of a fight.

Havoc: "O'FANG! GET OVER HERE, NOW! BARKER, GET CODY!"

I pushed Bella off of me, and got my head up. Dusty and Dusk were kicking the shit out of the Petty Officer, and I looked over the side to see blood in the water.

K: "WAVEDANCER!" I squirmed away from Bella, and dove right in.

Seven Devils: "ORDER ALL STOP! MAN OVERBOARD! MAN OVERBOARD!"

O'Fang: "I'M HERE!" I heard him as he jumped off the side and landed in the water near me.

K: "She's hit." I was holding her up, as the ship slid past, trying to come to a complete stop - but, of course, ships don't stop on a dime.

O'Fang: "I gotcha, pally. I gotcha. Yer gonna be okay." He was helping me hold her up.

I looked over to the ship, and they were lowering a boat into the water, at the same time one of the Scout Planes was lifting off to assist.

K: "I found the bleeder. Left fin, right here." I pressed my hand to it.

Wavedancer: "Ohh... it hurts!" She mewled.

O'Fang: "Yew just hang on, okay. We gotta doctor comin' an' I'm a medic. We're gonna gitcha patched up." He said, sticking a dressing into the wound, temporarily.

K: "Yeah, Wavedancer, hang on." I pet her watery mane.

O'Fang: "Yew wanna lay odds on how long 'dat petty officer's gonna have a career?" He smirked.

K: "Not long." I frowned. "He'll be cleaning heads for the rest of the war, if I have any say in it." I shrugged, as the Scout Plane hovered overhead.

TIME: 13:01 CET

We were back onboard, and both O'Fang and I had changed clothes. The Petty Officer was under arrest and in the brig. The Fleet Commander, Commodore Eleni Fteró (a Pegasi Vulpine), was in Sick Bay with us.

Cdre. Ftero: "I-I can't apologize enough, General K." She bowed her head again, almost ducking it away, as though she expected my pimp hand to cross her muzzle.

Of course, you all know, I would never do such a thing.

K: "It's not your fault, Commodore." I shrugged.

Seven: "Yeah, it's that Petty Officer." He scowled. "Cody?"

Dr. Allcome: "Oh, Wavedancer will be just fine." He smiled a bit. "The round went straight through the thinnest part of her fin flesh. Painful, to be sure, but by no means mortal." He nodded to Dusk. "You saved her life."

Dusk: "..I thought the Petty Officer was trying to shoot K." He shrugged. "Still."

K: "Still! You're a damn good Guard, Dusk." I nodded to him.

Rarity: "I have the bravest.. most handsome.. guard for a mate." She slid up alongside him.

Trixie: "WE." She snorted, and slid up his other side. "Watching you kick the road apples outta that guy, though." She wiggled her eyebrows.

Rarity: "Yes, darling. Such masculine displays will get you into great trouble." She smirked.

Dusk: "..I'm doomed." He laughed, though.

I went in to see Wavedancer, who Cody had resting in a watertight shallow box sort of thing, filled mostly with water.

K: "Hi, there." I smiled, as she stretched a bit.

Wavedancer: "Hello." She smiled back, and leaned up to nuzzle my face. "Thanks. You didn't have to dive in after me like that."

K: "Yes, I did." I nodded, as Katrina came in.

Katrina: "WAVEDANCER!" She cheered, and slipped by me to hug her. "Oh, it's been FOREVER!"

Wavedancer: "Katrina, too?!" She flicked her tail happily. "K, you have made some incredible friends."

K: "You don't know the half of it - what are you doing out here?" I shrugged.

Wavedancer: "So far from Dream Valley? Oh.. well.." She lolled her head to the side, sadly. "..everything changed, the place became dark and sad.." She frowned. "..then an emissary from Poseidon came to us and told us we had to flee before it was too late." She shrugged.

K: "And you did." I nodded.

Wavedancer: "It was right after Queen Bumble was turned into that nasty Ecdysis!" She snorted a bit.

K: "I remember that - I was there. I fought her." I nodded.

Wavedancer: "The last few Flutterponies fought her, too. The ones Galactica Spark didn't kill." She sniffled a little. "I miss them, K. They were always so nice to us."

Norfy: "..were we, now?" He stepped in.

Wavedancer: "Phhfft! NORPHEUS!?" She snorted water.

Norfy: "His reincarnation, yes." He nodded.

Applejack: "Well, hey howdy, ever'one's in he-" She stopped as soon as she saw Wavedancer.

Both of then stared at each other. Norfy caught it immediately, went over to AJ, and helped ease her down to the deck.

Norfy: "Applejack." He spoke softly to her.

Applejack: "I'm okay, Norpheus." Her voice.. wasn't her voice...

Wavedancer: "..Shoo-be-doo. Shoo-shoo-be-doo.." She blinked.

Applejack: "..call upon the Sea Ponies.." Her voice was gruffer, and lacked her southern drawl.

Norfy: "Applejack, do you remember?" He asked, quietly.

Applejack: "Sure do.. r-rescued me and.. Megan.." She blinked, and snapped out of it, shaking her head, and her voice returning to normal. "WHUT in TARNATION was THAT?!" She blinked.

K: "You were, for a brief moment, Ancient Applejack." I nodded to her.

Applejack: "Aw.." She blinked. "..ah di'n't lahk that a'tall.." She drawled out as she shivered a bit, and slid up next to me, seeking comfort. I hugged her.

Norfy: "Past life bleed-throughs." He nodded.

K: "Wavedancer.." I moved back over to her. "..do you need us?" I tilted my head at her.

Wavedancer: "No, but YOU need US!" She smiled. "I can get you an audience with Poseidon!"

K: "Get me Seaspray and the other Hippogriffs." I pointed at Dusk.

Dusk: "On it." He nodded, and departed.

Wavedancer: "Hm!" She grinned.

So, my first step, it seemed, would be meeting Poseidon. With Seaspray's help, I wouldn't be going down there unarmed and without backup, either.

What might Poseidon want with me?

Part 4: Realm of Water

TIME: 14:44 CET
DATE: War Day 1038/6 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Under the Agean Sea, 25nmi South of Attica, Vulpesylvanian Territorial Waters


I was swimming about as well as I had before. I was also stripped down - only the Sword of Rainbow's Light, my clothes (because I did not want to be naked), and a smile. With me was Seaspray, Silver Stream, Terramar, Lieutenant Skyranger, and.. Rainbow McSherbet.

Why? Because he had a diving mask and air tank specially made for him ages ago, and it was among the cargo recovered after the sinking of the Weather Rock. He was using the little propeller on his prosthesis to propel himself along under the water.

Wavedancer was leading us. I didn't have a mask, but with Leviathan's little "blessing" (and I screamed again when the gills formed - GOD THAT HURTS), I didn't need it. There was a HUGE temple-like structure down here, and LOADS of true Sea Ponies all over the place.

The temple, as the stories told, was made of pure gold. And there were no signs of decay anywhere. Several Sea Ponies swam up to Wavedancer, and motioned for us to follow them.


LOCATION: Temple-Castle of Poseidon, Aegae, 25nmi South of Attica


We were led into the temple, and I could hear - even through the water - all kinds of music being sung and played. The Sea Ponies were all happy, swimming around without a care in the world.

Soon, though, we came to the center of the temple. I saw Sherby stutter under his mask, blowing some bubbles, as Poseidon himself rose from his throne. He immediately bowed before him. I took a knee.

K: "God Poseidon. I am K---- K---, supposedly the Human of Legend, an-"

Poseidon: "Say no more." He nodded to me. "I see.. you've brought friends."

K: "I have, Your Lordship." I stayed bowing, I wasn't sure how these "Greek" Gods were about formalities.

Poseidon: "Oh, get up." He gestured. "No need for such formality."

I let the ocean assist me in rising to a stand.

Poseidon: "YOU.. wish to meet with my brothers." He nodded. A hand motion, and the waters receded around us, leaving a pool at the back of the room for the Sea Ponies and Hippogriffs. "Something about an ancient story saying you need the power of lightning?"

K: "Yes, sir." I nodded, as I felt the weight of normal atmosphere weigh me down again.

Poseidon: "You seek to destroy Tirek." He nodded.

K: "Yes, sir, I do. And I would give my life right now if it meant an end to the killing." I looked right at him.

He made a sudden thrust with his Trident - which appeared out of nowhere - and was shocked when all I did was close my eyes. I didn't flinch, I didn't go for my sword.. I just accepted that, perhaps, he did have the power to trade my life for Tirek and his goons.

Poseidon: "I'm impressed. It's been a very long time since a mortal showed this kind of resolve." He nodded, and sat back on his throne. "To ascend Mount Olympus properly, you will need my blessing." He whipped out a golden crown of olive leaves (a Kotinos), and leaned over, placing it on my head.

K: "I thank you, Lord Poseidon." I nodded to him. "I'm serious."

Poseidon: "I see this." He smirked. "And I see you saved Wavedancer." He nodded to her.

Wavedancer: "Yes, Poseidon." She flicked her tail in the pool. "He cares. He cares about all of us. Like Megan once did."

Poseidon: "Then it is only right that we Olympian Primordals grant you the power you seek." He nodded. "I see you already robbed one of the Norse Gods." And smirked. "GOOD! They get so stuck up about their little apocalypse, most of them refuse to party. They just glorify eternal battle and death." He dismissively waved his hand. "I think you'd call them.. Emos?" He laughed.

The Greek God of the Seas.. just called.. the Norse Gods.. Emos.

My life is complete.

K: "Can I ask how much more there is to get, Lord Poseidon?" I nodded to him.

Poseidon: "I can't answer that. Not because I don't know, but because the answer is inside you. You and you alone will know when the powers of the Sword of Rainbow's Light are complete enough to destroy Tirek. You.. COULD spend the next fifty years gaining power. Or, just a few." He shrugged.. and looked at Sherby. "Well! If it isn't one of the very few ponies out there that calls for me when he's in trouble." He smirked. "You.. just hang on a second." He waved his hand in the air, and an Octopus Assistant came out, and handed him a small box, which he placed before Sherby.

He opened it, and gasped in shock.

Sherby: "ORICHALCUM!" He looked at the box, then to Poseidon, then back at the box.

Poseidon: "There is plenty there for you to.. enhance.. what you've engineered. And more besides." He smiled. "Call it a reward. That, and I know, if you swim with the human, you'll NEED it." He chortled. "WE have SEEN the trouble you get into!"

K: "I am glad to be so entertaining, Lord Poseidon." I smiled back.

Poseidon: "Mm." He smirked. "You also know that.. these ponies.. they're special to me."

K: "I do." I nodded. "I will do everything I can to protect them."

Poseidon: "I know you will." He smiled widely. "Now! You have appointments to keep." He nodded. "Our Pantheon supports you wholly, K----."

K: "I will do my best to justify that support." I nodded back.

And with that, my counsel with the god Poseidon was concluded. We were escorted back to the Prince Orlando by Wavedancer again. Dusk, Havoc, and Seven were waiting with one of the ship's small boats to pick us up.

K: "You never did say how you stayed alive for 10,000 years, Wavedancer." I nodded to her, as I breached the surface.

Wavedancer: "Ohh.. I became one of Poseidon's avatars." She shrugged her fins. "If you ever need us. Just call upon the Sea Ponies." She gave me a fin-y hug. "Havoc? Seven? I expect you to do your part against Tirek!" She smiled. "But, then, come see me, okay? I want to play again! Just like before!"

Seven: "You know we will." He grinned.

The blessings of a God, and a path before me. Next stop - Vulpesylvania!

Part 5: Jack Pot's Grand European Tour

TIME: 11:22 Eastern European Time/06:22 Equestrian Royal Standard Time
DATE: War Day 1039/7 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Athens, Principality of Vulpesylvania


We were just getting on shore, disembarking from the Prince Orlando. The HMS Hermes and her Carrier Battle Group were already here, along with the HMS Sunstone Surface Battle Group. If we needed it, we had it.

Sargasso Sea: "K!" She rushed over, and gave me a hug. "I heard.. about White Cap." She sniffled. "I'm going to miss them."

K: "I will, too." I nodded. "They were one of our best admirals." I shrugged.

Dusk: "Sargasso." He nodded. "The rest of CAG come with?"

Sargasso: "You know it. Everyone's here." She nodded.

From the side, just outside of the Naval Base, we could hear the shouts of a Carnie caller.

Carnie: "MARES AND GENTLECOLTS! VIXENS AND TODS! HUR-AY HUR-AY HUR-AY! THE GREATEST MAGIC SHOW IN THE WORLD! FOR ONE DAY ONLY! IS SHOWING OFF TRICKS AND MYSTICAL SECRETS SURE TO AMAZE AND WONDER!"

Trixie: "Pfht." She slid up by Dusk. "Mine's SO much better. I mean-"

Carnie: "ONE DAY ONLY! THE GREAT JACK POT AND HIS PARTNER BIG BUCKS! IN THE GREATEST SHOW IN THE WORLD!"

Trixie: "..ah.." She blinked. "NO.. FLANKING.. WAY.." Her eyes went wide.. and she grabbed Dusk and Rarity. "COME ON!"

Rarity: "DARLING! What are you-"

Dusk: "-doing?! Where are we going!?"

I looked at Applejack sidewise, and we both nodded at the same time, taking off after them.

I didn't realize Brindle Spindle was following.

It took us a bit to get out from the port, and over to where the trailer stage had been set up. It was larger than Trixie's, but OH BOY.. was it VERY similar! Amazingly so.

And when I say "larger," I mean, it's about twice the size. It has a larger stage, and I could see the stage itself was far more splendid (it seemed to be shellacked or waxed or something). There were lights embedded into the stage - lantern moss lights, no less. A bit of rug trim along the edges, too.

Trixie: "Gawsh, it's even better than mine was." She growled.

Dusk: "What's going ON, Trixie?!" He finally got her around to face him.

Trixie: "Jack Pot... welll..." She shrugged.

Big Bucks: "AND NOW, THE MAIN ATTRACTION! JACK POT, AND BIG BUCKS!"

The crowd around us started clapping (it was mostly foxes, but there was a decent crowd of horses from my fleet, here).

Out on to the stage strutted a male horse with the EXACT SAME coat and mane color as Trixie. He was older - a bit younger than Brindle, but older than Dusk - and still very handsome by pony standards. He was flanked by a stallion who's coat was the EXACT SAME color as.. Starlight Glimmer's!?

Something very strange was going on here, and I could feel Twilight pace up next to me and give me a nudge.

Twilight: "Something's up, K." She frowned.

The two stallions took their bows and began their act.

Jack Pot: "For starters, my little ponies and vulpines.." He held up the Magic Rings, and did the usual tugs on them. "..behold a magic that not even the best unicorns have mastered besides us. Pulling METAL through METAL." And he did the trick where they just slide apart.

Trixie: "OH, COME ON! EVERYONE KNOWS THOSE RINGS HAVE A CUT IN THEM!" She steamed through her nostrils. "HOW ABOUT A REAL MAGIC TRICK!?" She jumped up and stormed out on to the stage. "REAPPEARING IN YOUR DAUGHTER'S LUNA-DAMNED LIFE?!"

The crowd gave an "OOooOOOOOOO!!" sound, at the drama. The Equestrian sailors knew Trixie to a degree.. moreover, they knew she was CAG, and they respected that she was one of my inner circle - they'd back her.

Jack Pot: "AHH!" He looked startled. "Ah-er-uhn.. BEHOLD! THE GREAT DISCIPLE OF JACK POT AND BIG BUCKS, THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRI-"

Trixie: "SHUT. THE. BUCK. UP." She screamed at him.. and stormed over to him. "If I know you, *DAD* (that was dripping with venom), you're going to put on a half-flanked magic show and try to sell of some fake magic items to the Pegasi and Earthbounds, telling them anyone can do magic. But it's all FAKE! EVERYTHING YOU DO IS FAKE! FROM YOUR FAKE MAGIC, TO YOUR FAKE FATHERHOOD! YOU'RE A FAKE, A LIAR, A CHARLATAN, AND YOU DON'T LOVE ANYONE BUT YOURSELF! YOU NEVER DID! THAT'S WHAT YOU TAUGHT ME, *DAD*!" She screeched, and started tearing up.. "..your love was as fake as your magic." ..and started full on crying. "GET AWAY FROM HERE!" She turned to the crowd. "THIS FAKE DOESN'T DESERVE YOUR BITS, OR YOUR ATTENTION!" She slid back around at him.. and her face screwed up in pain.. and she RAN off stage.

I looked at Dusk. Like.. she'd technically issued an order, but he and I both knew that neither one of us had any right to back up that order with our own (ranked) authority.

He looked back and shrugged, then took off after her. Rarity was close behind, and then following them, was Brindle.

Twilight: "Alright, everypony!" She turned to face the crowd. "If you're NEIGHTO troops - clear the area! You heard Trixie." She looked back to the stage in a sidewise glance - she could feel Trixie's pain. "If you're not, I have no authority over you." She shrugged her wings, and walked away.. and once she was out of sight, SHE took off after Trixie, too.

So did AJ and I.

There was some SERIOUS trauma here. And I knew we'd need to get to the bottom of it. After all, we were Trixie's friends. And friendship, is magic.
