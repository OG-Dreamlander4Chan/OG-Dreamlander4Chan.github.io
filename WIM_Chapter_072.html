Part 1: Lunarly Eclipsed

TIME: 09:21 ERDT
DATE: War Day 683/17 Secundus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Ponyville, Erie, Kingdom of Equestria

So much was going on, these days. So many small problems to work out. When I explained everything with Tree Hugger to Applejack, she just.. uh.. took her revenge, but as we cuddled afterwards, she told me straight out that she expected it, given the context, and Tree Hugger's personality.

She was grateful, though, that I was able to get through to her, and that I'd once again demonstrated that I can make friends from potential enemies. She also flat out stated that if the two of us got to Rowed Island, she was damn sure going to take her out for a spin - especially once I explained her oral skills.

Ah, yes, my Country-Fried Sex Freak of a wife. Enjoying all that life has to offer, and any chance she can get to enjoy the phyiscal nature of love and friendship.. thanks to me showing her how good it is.

In two days, Redheart was expected to deliver. I was out at the shops, picking out some gifts. It was at Jasmine Leaf's tea shop that I bumped into someone I'd never seen before..

K: "Oh! I'm terribly sorry.." I nodded to her.

She was a cream-coated unicorn mare with a messy bun of red and pink. She wore thick, horn-rimmed glasses, that.. WERE taped together at the middle, but when I bumped her, they fell to the ground, and broke.

Mare: "Oh..! GREAT! Just GREAT!" She sneered at me. "WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING!"

K: "I'm sorry!" I held my hands up in surrender.

Mare: "Pft.. not that it matters." She grumbled, agitated, and picked up the two halves.

K: "I.. uh.. I have some repair tape.." I was digging in my tool pouch-

Mare: "Keep it!" She hissed.

K: "Whoa!" I backed all the way off. "A-Again, I'm really sorry."

Jasmine Leaf: "Ahh.. Dancer, here's your tea." She placed a box on the counter.

Dancer: "Yeah." She placed down the required Bits, took the box, and huffed out.

K: "..Jaz, who the HELL was that?" I blinked.

Jasmine Leaf: "Oh! That's Moon Dancer." She shrugged. "I barely know her name. She comes to the shop once a month for tea."

K: "Strange. I've never seen her before." I blinked. "She new here?"

Jasmine Leaf: "Nope. Been a regular customer for years. Oh, she was MAD after Second Ponyville! Remember? My shop partly burnt down?" She sighed. "I don't know what her problem is.. but.. she's very negative."

K: "I can see that." I nodded. "Ahhh.. anyhow.. I wanted some tea that's good for ponies that've just given birth and are nursing." I shrugged. "You know, so nothing harmful passes to the baby?"

Jasmine Leaf: "OH! Yes! Yes." She nodded, and went about looking through her wares.

K: "It's for Genny." I nodded, with a small smile. "She's due in a couple days."

Jasmine Leaf: "Oh, yeah?" She blinked. "Pinkie throwing a Baby Shower?"

K: "Tomorrow at three, if you can make it." I nodded to her. "Everyone in town's invited." I chuckled. "Odd, since, human tradition has it that it's a more.. subdued sort of event and you only invite your closest galpals.. eh.. marepals?" I tilted my head, still not quite used to the slang, despite three and a half years of immersion.

Jasmine Leaf: *Giggle!* "Close enough, K." She nodded to me. "Here, this should do. Genny might like a little cream and honey in it." She slid a box across the counter.

K: "Oh, awesome." I set the payment next to it, and a tip, and took the box. "Also, have you gotten that shipment of Ja-ah-ah-Neighponese tea in, yet?" Almost said 'Japanese' there..

Jasmine Leaf: "Thought you'd never ask." She set three boxes on the counter, from underneath. "I had them ready for you. One of the boxes actually had your Letter on it." She grinned. "Gift from the Emperor, I'm sure."

I paid for those, too, and stuck them in my satchel.

K: "Thanks, Jaz. Catch you later." I nodded, and departed.

I went around the main shop street, with all the street vendors selling various wares. I spotted Moon Dancer again, picking up some vegetables.. but she was also carting a lot of foods that would last long in storage. Like.. it hinted she shopped once a month.

That's how I used to shop, after all, when I was poor. Every meal was planned out, the pennies counted, and the portions.. ehh.. roughly measured. It struck me that she was doing the EXACT same thing. Weekly shopping is such a flex.

It hit me as odd, and I couldn't shake it, all the time I was out shopping.

Finally, I went to Twilight's. First, to let her know about the Baby Shower, and second, to drop off some Ink she'd asked me to pick up while I was out. I may be Equestria's General, but that doesn't mean I'm above helping out my friends.

K: "Twilight?" I paced in, and found Spike reading.. a book on dating. "Hey, bud." I leaned over him.

Spike: "OH! K!" He tossed the book in surprise.

K: "Haha.. trying to get some ideas for Smolder, eh?" I patted him on the head. "My advice is simple. Be you. If she doesn't like who you really are, she isn't worth your time. That's how I ended up with both J-- and Applejack." I shook my head. "Be thoughtful, talk to her, make eye contact, and when your feelings get to that point, remind her you love her every day."

Spike: "Whoa.. that sure beats all THIS stuff!" He picked up the book and handed it to me.

The advice was.. bad, to say the least, but comically so, like.. they could have written an entire episode of Spike trying things from this book to impress Smolder, for all of it to comically fail, and him learn the lesson I just told him, in the end.

Twilight: "OH! K! I thought I heard you." She came in, drying off her hooves. "Sorry, I was doing some stuff for Bright Eyes." She shrugged. "Did you remember the ink?"

K: "Sure did.." I pulled it out, along with a block of Neighponese solid ink. "Got you this, too."

Twilight: "OOoooo! Hey, this is pretty expensive.." She blinked at me.

K: "Gift." I shrugged. "Besides, I expensed it. I'm sure you'll put it to some kind of Wartime use somehow, somewhere along the line." I smirked.

Twilight: "Aw!" She giggled a bit, though. "Thanks, K."

K: "Eh, no problem." I shrugged. "Off topic, but do you know a pony named Moon Dancer?"

She suddenly got The Vietnam Stare in her eyes, like she was reliving a memory she didn't really want, but half a second later, it was gone.

Twilight: "Uh.. we.. went to Magic Academy together..? But, I haven't seen her in years!" She shrugged.

K: "She lives here in town, you know." I nodded to her.

Twilight: "I've never SEEN her!" She blinked.

K: "Was she always such a sourpuss?" I tilted my head to her.

Twilight: "I-I.. I have no idea.. what you mean. I mean, she was a classmate, and I knew her.. but.. no, I don't think so."

K: "I bumped into her at Jaz's shop, you know? And I knocked her glasses off by accident. And she was.. like.. REALLY nasty to me. I've never seen a Pony with that nasty an attitude that wasn't also completely insane." Trixie, I meant.

Twilight: "Ohh.. that doesn't sound like her at all!" She blinked a few times. "I-I.. should.. do something about that." She frowned. "I mean, I knew her.." She shook her head.

K: "How WELL?" I asked.

Twilight: "Ahh.. about as well as any of them?" She tilted her head, and rested her fetlock on her chin, thinking.

K: "Knowing you? Not that well." I smirked.

Twilight: "OH! I do remember Twinkle Shine telling me.. uh.. she was going to have a get-together.. it was.. just before I came to Ponyville." She blinked. "That was.. four years ago."

K: "Huh." I shrugged. "Why don't we go see her, then?"

Twilight: "Sure!" She beamed a grin.

Oh, if I had ANY idea how this was going to go, I might not have brought her.

[End of Part 1]

Part 2: Dancing on the Moon

TIME: 10:09 ERDT
DATE: War Day 683/17 Secundus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Dilapidated House, Ponyville

K: "..Pinkie said this was the place." I blinked, and looked at it. I remembered running past here during 2nd Ponyville, and dodging fire. In fact, I could still see bullet holes and cracks in the walls from an artillery shell's near miss. "Strange it hasn't been repaired. I told 'Brose and the others to make sure all the houses got fixed up."

Twilight: *Uneasy* "Y-Yeah.." She blinked. "MOON DANCER! Are you ho-"

K: "GET DOWN!" I shoved her to the ground, seeing the twin barrels of a Sagebrush Shotgun slide through a broken window.

Moon Dancer fired, alright, but the shot was into the dirt almost a meter in front of us. That was a warning shot... and she did good to shoot well wide of us. She also only fired ONE barrel.

Moon Dancer: "GO AWAY! SECOND ONE'S YOUR FLANK!" She demanded.

K: "Moon Dancer! Stop! Come on, we just want to talk!" I called out to her.

Twilight: "Moon Dancer, it's me, Twilight Sparkle!" She called to her as well.

Moon Dancer: "I know who YOU are!" She hissed. "Him, too! Just.. just GO AWAY! Leave me ALONE!" She demanded, again.

I picked Twilight up under one arm, and retreated. Once we were a good bit away, I set her down. She wasn't happy with me..

Twilight: "Really, K?!" She gave me a hoof-push. "You didn't need to grab me like that."

K: "I didn't want you ending up with speed holes." I shrugged.

Twilight: "Well, I'm glad you care." She sighed. "What's her PROBLEM, though?"

K: "I have no idea." I shrugged.

Twilight: "Well.. we need.. to do something." She frowned and plopped to her haunches. "I don't know. I suppose.. I feel like I have to."

K: "That's a good enough reason for me." I shrugged back. "Let me try, okay?" I gestured. "It certainly couldn't go any worse."

Twilight: "Okay." She nodded.

So, I walked over to the edge of her property.. and a bit further back from the warning shot than I'd been before.

K: "MOON DANCER!" I called out.

There was a pause.. the barrels slid out of the window again, but she held her fire.

K: "COME ON, I JUST WANT TO TALK! AND, NO, I'M NOT GOING AWAY UNTIL I HEAR WHAT THE PROBLEM IS!" I called to her.

No response.

K: "IS IT ME!? DID I DO SOMETHING AND NOT REALIZE IT?!" I flapped my arms.

No response again.

K: "COME ON! THERE'S GOT TO BE A REASON YOU'RE SO ANGRY! I JUST WANT TO HELP! EVERYONE NEEDS A FRIEND-"

That set the other barrel off, and it impacted almost right next to the first.

Oooo.. touchy-touchy.

K: "I mean it!" I stopped shouting, and changed the tone of my voice to one of concern. "Come on! At least tell me what the problem is! You do, maybe I go away. You don't? I can keep this up until the War ends, if I have to!"

Moon Dancer: "..FINE!"

The barrels slid away from the window.. and after a moment, I could hear SEVERAL locks being undone at the door. Like, a comically high number. I paced over, and met her at the door. She opened it, and scowled at me.

Moon Dancer: "It.. yes, I'm mad at you for damaging my house. And breaking my glasses. But, that's not the reason I want to be left alone. That PURPLE MENACE is the reason!" She sniffled.

K: "Twilight?" I tilted my head.

Moon Dancer: "Yeah.." She trailed off. "..she's.. does she even realize what she's done?"

K: "Honestly, no." I shrugged. "I have no idea what she's done, either."

Moon Dancer: "..come in." She bade me enter.

And I did.

The interior was just as dilapidated as the exterior. Like, everything in here was shoddy, worn, or broken. Very few 'new' things, except books. Lots of books. And a transcription stand similar to Twilight's, but older and showing wear. I surmised that her employment was likely based around book transcription.

Moon Dancer: "All her life, she's been like this." She muttered, plopping down on a couch with an exposed spring.

K: "Like what?" I just.. sat on the floor - knowing Pinkie's Theory of Comedy Zones, I made the guess that any of these chairs that I picked, would break.

Moon Dancer: "Distant. More into books than Ponies. Uncaring. Rude. Really, really, REALLY RUDE!" She spat that out.

K: "What happened between you two?" I just asked.

Moon Dancer: "When I heard she might be leaving Canterlot, I wanted to throw a party.. she never showed." She looked down. "All the time she was in Academy with me, I tried to be her friend, and she just IGNORED me! Like.. like.. I was worthless to her or anyone else!" She started tearing up. "Then.. this WAR happened.. and.." She lowered her head, then looked me in the eye with pure rage. "Do you even KNOW how many of our classmates have died!?"

K: "Not.. offhand. Not because I don't know who they were, but because I don't know which ones attended Academy with you two." I shrugged.

Moon Dancer: "Twinkle Shine."

K: "Ponyville Militia, 3rd Company, Sergeant of 2nd Squad. Died in the Second Battle of Ponyville with Caramel and the rest of 3rd Company, delaying the invading monsters long enough for the rest of the units present to withdraw in good order and set up a defensive line inside the town." I nodded, reciting. "She was a Machine Gunner, and scored 87/100 at her last qualification. She had a close friendship with Scout Lemon Hearts.. who still misses her." I lowered my head. "On a more personal note, she was dating Carlisle Thisleweed, but she wasn't sure if it was the Real Thing just yet.. she was waiting for him to say he loved her.." Now *I* started tearing up. "I don't know if he had a chance to tell her!" And I hit my thighs with my fists.

Moon Dancer: "O-Oh.." She blinked. "..you."

K: "Each one of them, Dancer.. each and every one of them. I see them, in my sleep, in my nightmares." I stared off into the distance. "I can hear them, I can see them.. and each death hurts me." I lowered my head. "I'd die right now if it meant bringing them all back, and Tirek was gone forever."

Moon Dancer: "You care." She said, softly.

K: "I do. I care. I cared about each one of them." I looked up at her. "I still do. Just like I care about you."

Moon Dancer: "Why ME, though?!" She scoffed. "You just MET me today! And I've been here LONGER than YOU have!"

K: "I-I.." I shook my head. "Do you just come out of the house ONCE a month?"

Moon Dancer: "Every day to get the mail." She blinked. "But, to town, yes, once a month."

K: "There you go, then. I can't very well meet you, if I never see you." I gestured to her. "Did you really like Twilight, and want to be her friend? And her snubbing you to study.. is that what made you so reclusive?"

Moon Dancer: "More or less." She curled up into herself. "I did everything I could to be her friend, and she just.. totally ignored me. Like I said. And.. I figured.. if I all I got for trying was rejection, what's the point?"

K: "I admit, Twilight was even like that when I first got here." I shrugged. "The war's changed her. A lot." I nodded a bit. "She's still the same old book worm, but she's had to put herself out there a lot. In danger. Trixie Lulamoon nearly killed her. Chrysalis, Queen of the Changelings, killed her brother. She's lost a lot, in this war, and she's been through a lot. Back then.. I guess.. part of the reason Celestia picked her to find out about the Magic of Friendship is because Celestia saw she didn't really HAVE any friends." I frowned. "You know she was raped at the Academy, right? And that's where Spike came from?"

Moon Dancer: "I-I.." She lowered her head again. "..she wasn't the only one." She murmured out.

K: "You, too?" I tilted my head.

Moon Dancer: "She lives with my parents. They said I wasn't ready. She thinks she's my sister." She hugged herself. "Her name's Star Dancer."

K: "I'm so sorry." I shook my head.

Moon Dancer: "I thought.. you know.. we could bond over that, too, but she just ignored it, just like she did me. When Spike was born, I saw her carry him everywhere.. but.. it felt like.. to me.. he was an accessory. Not a kid. Not HER kid. And she got to KEEP him!" She sniffled.

K: "Damn.." I shook my head again. All this TRAUMA! If there WAS a Spell of Carefree or something, like I'd theorized, then this level of Trauma and total rejection of social norms, must overpower it. "Can.. can I call Twilight in here? I know for a fact that if she's shown the error of her ways, she'll apologise. And she'll mean it." I reached out to her. "Please. Let me.. let me help you."

Moon Dancer: "..why not." She shrugged.

When Twilight came in, though, the mood changed. She'd been eavesdropping on the conversation, and was already in tears, begging Moon Dancer to forgive her.

Twilight: "..I was too.. too pig-headed to realize what was even going ON around me!" She thumped her forehead with her hooves. "I feel like the biggest idiot! I'm so.. I'm so sorry!" She sobbed into Moon Dancer's shoulder.

Moon Dancer cried with her.. the healing was starting, and I could see that.

So, I got up, and moved to leave.

K: "Dancer.. tomorrow at three, in the East Field. Be there, okay?" I nodded to her.

She just nodded back, crying into Twilight's shoulder.

Sometimes, healing means tears. Sometimes, it means hugs and ice cream.

Sometimes, you find a friend you never thought you'd have.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Shower

TIME: 15:00 ERDT
DATE: War Day 684/18 Secundus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: East Field, Ponyville, Erie, Kingdom of Equestria

We were just starting the Baby Shower. Pinkie went INSANE with the decorations, and Forest Spirit and I were.. kinda off to the side with the other stallions. Feeling out of place, but wanting to support the Marefolk in this little ceremony.

I spotted Moon Dancer and Twilight Sparkle arrive together with Spike, and smiled and nodded to them.

Forest Spirit: "So.. how.. how do they do things like this in Humanland?" He chuckled a bit.

Gaze: "Kinn'a curious 'boot that one m'self, K." He nodded.

K: "Well, Baby Showers are usually very private affairs between the expectant mother and her closest female friends. Sometimes, especially in the last twenty years, it's been socially acceptable to also invite Gay male friends as well." I shrugged. "Point is, it's a gathering of females or fem-types, to celebreate the impending birth of the baby, both as a celebration of the baby itself, and being a wife. Gifts range from stuff for the baby, to intimate lingerie and other adult things, to encourage the spicing up of the bedroom, and another possible kid." I smirked.

Norfy: "Interesting." He nodded. "It's.. kinda.. fifty-fifty around here. Sometimes it's like that, sometimes it's like this. I think Pinkie just wanted an excuse to party, and I'm pretty sure Redheart needed this."

K: "For sure." I nodded to Forest Spirit.

Forest Spirit: "Oh, yeah. The last week, she's been very laid up. She needs help with a lot. The babies are going to be huge." He grinned widely.

Cosmic: "Well. It'll be a nice thing, either way - celebrating new life instead of loss." He nodded.

K: "Uh-huh. And what are you and Kiwi planning..?" I leaned into him.

Cosmic: "Oh.. she wants at least two kids." He smiled, simply. "We're going to make a try this year."

K: "Alright, well, let me know and I'll schedule her leave. Dawn Earlylight can take her place on the front line staff if I need her." I nodded, sipping my juice.

Norfy: "Awful casual about it." He smirked.

Cosmic: "Eh." He shrugged. "The war's changed me. I'm not so reclusive and embarrassed about things any more. Especially with my closest friends." And smiled.

K: "That.. that's awesome, Coz." I smiled as well.

The ladies, on the other hand, were all over by the main table, chattering about babies. Koringo was firmly attached to Applejack, as an example of "D'aww, so cute" and she was loving the attention.

Ironhide: "Gentlemen." He nodded, coming over to the punch bowl.. he gave it a sniff, first.

K: "I made it." I nodded.

Ironhide: "Then, it's safe." He nodded back, and got himself a cup.

Norfy: "I didn't know punch making was a tactical skill, K." He grinned a bit.

K: "Of course it is - espionage missions. What if you have to disguise as waitstaff?" I tilted my head and grinned back.

Gaze: "Ye kin' fess aboot makin' punch fer, like, an hour or more." He smirked. "Not bad."

K: "What's nice is, you guys had all kinds of great ingredients that I never would have had on Earth.." I looked over at Ironhide, who took a big swig. "..like those pink chilis."

Ironhide: "OOOO! SPICY!" He got flushed in the cheeks, and started panting.

Gaze: "Spicy punch..?" He took a cup himself, and had a small sip. "YEEOW!"

K: "Ambleonian dishes are mostly cold and have little seasoning outside of gentle-flavored herbs and salt when available." I nodded. "You're not used to it."

Norfy: "..okay, I have a challenge." He took a cup, and downed it. He.. TRIED to hold it together, but his cheeks flushed, and I watched his horn glow, as he tried to use magic to quash the Scoville Units. "OO! Okay, okay..!"

I dipped my cup in, getting a full one, and downed it. I sniffed a couple times, and nodded.

K: "No worse than Jalapenos." I smirked. "Clears the sinuses."

Norfy: "Two years, and I'm still learning your odd, human, dietary habits." He smirked.

K: "Eh." I shrugged, with a grin.

I noticed Webley, Blinda, and Dusty all showed up. Dusty was back in uniform. Her Class-A Gendarmes uniform - sand tan collared shirt, dark khaki pants with a stripe down the leg, polished above-the-hoofcap shoes on her rear hooves, medium-tan necktie, and a jacket that matched the pants with her Gendarmes badge on it. As she was a SWAT officer, she wore a Patrol Cap.

I'd.. I'd actually designed it to look like the uniform of most U.S. Sheriffs Departments. It was one of a set of uniforms that the local Gendarmes offices could pick from. I also had "City Police Blues" that resembled NYPD or Chicago P.D. from the 1980's, and "Trooper Greys" that resembled some State Police uniforms, with slate grey as the base color. Each office could pick their own uniform set. LPMG picked "Sheriff Tans."

More girls showed up. Kiwi Spritz was here already, with her man. Campanula and Radio were here, too, and so was Dawn. I took the chance to go over and carve those three from the Herd.

K: "Campanula!" I hugged her.

SSgt. Campanula: "OH! Bon Giorno, K!" She hugged back, a little surprsied.

K: "I haven't seen you in ages. You're always somewhere I'm not. And here you are, dating one of my closest friends." I shrugged. "I'm sorry."

Campanula: "No, it's fine, K." She nodded a bit. "I understand. The war keeps us all'a busy." She smiled a bit. "Thank you, though, for making me an Instructor."

K: "Least I could do." I nodded. "You ever think you're up for a Combat assignment, you let me know, I'll make it happen."

Campanula: "Likely, no. But, that is fine." She bowed her head a bit, graciosuly. "I have'a my hooves full teaching many Engineer recruits."

K: "I did say the Royal Army needs its own Engineer force." I shrugged. "When we invade Tirek's home land, Combat Engineers are going to be at a premium, no matter what."

Campanula: "Si, is why I work so hard - so you can have the best possible." She nodded a bit.

K: "And I thank you.. and thank you more for making Norfy so happy." I smirked a bit, and turned to Dawn Earlylight. "As for you, you might be taking Kiwi's place as a member of my Active Command Team, if she and Cosmic can get pregnant this year. What'cha say?"

Dawn: "I.." She blushed. "..I'm honored." She made a tiny squee noise. "I've been at the Palace a lot, working with Radio, and working with the War Materiel Office. I'd like some combat duty, if it's possible." She shrugged, and looked down a bit. "Not that I'm not happy doing my job.. I just.. feel like I can do more, and I want to."

K: "Alright. Well, we'll see, eh?" I gave her a short nod. "Radio. Looking good."

Radio Active: "FEELING good. Like.. you know.. it's taken me this long to feel better about myself in general.." *Lustily* "..Norfy helps so much.." *AHEM!* "And-And get my soldierly Bearing back." She nodded firmly. "I'm with Dawn - if we can see some front line service, sign us up."

K: "I'll see what's in the offing, okay?" I nodded to them both. "Excuse me."

I went over to Moon Dancer and Twilight, now that they were a bit off to the side, and carved THEM away from the Herd of Mares.

Twilight: "..and we have no idea why Gallart Bonebeard wasn't in any of the texts we've found so far!" She shrugged.

Dancer: "I've seen his name pop up in some of the transcriptions I've done in the past.." She sighed. "..I thought he was another name for Starswirl the Bearded. I mean, Gallart Bonebeard?" She shrugged. "OH! K!" She cleared her throat. "S-Sorry for almost shooting you guys."

K: "It's fine." I shrugged.

Dancer: "I.. kinda.. spent the whole night talking to Twilight." She rubbed her arm with her opposite fetlock. "I'm so sorry."

Twilight: "We did a lot of apologizing." She shrugged.

K: "Dancer. You're probably one of the smartest in Equestria. I'd love i-"

Dancer: "I-I want to contribute." She stammered out. "I'm going to start by going back through some of my transcriptions. I-I'd like someone that knows accounting to go through my books. I'm.. I'm kinda scared I might've helped bad people without realizing it."

K: "I'll get ahold of Chemical Lens. She knows a couple Forensic Accountants." I nodded. "As for you, consider yourself a Civilian Employee of the Equestrian Government. If you want to train up for Service, let Harv know. How much were you making as a Transcriber?"

Dancer: "Ohh.. about 250 Bits a month." She shrugged.

K: "I'll pay you 600 a month. That's the starting pay for a Corporal." I nodded to her. "We'll see how things go, but I guarantee you'll be making a lot more than that."

Dancer: "Yeah." She blinked. "I always felt like I didn't deserve anything new, or.. or even properly fixed and working.. and.." She sniffled. "..I felt so worthless."

K: "You're worth more than you think." I leaned down and hugged her. "All I can do is apologize for not being a friend when you needed one."

Dancer: "Y-You're not Omipotent or Omniscient." She hugged back, though.

Twilight: "Come on, let's see what Redheart's gifts are going to be!" She encouraged her new friend, and off they went.

A far worse case of isolation than Chem had been.. so much pain and trauma behind it, too. I was glad she was healing, though.

Dr. Allcome: "You can see her, now." He came out, patting Forest Spirit on the shoulder.

He dragged me in there, with him. Applejack followed.

Generosity Redheart-Spirit: "K!" She beamed, glowing, and holding twins. "One of each, K." She giggled.

Forest Spirit: "I shall name them.. Blaze Spirit, and Angel Spirit." He nodded.

I got a faint feeling in the back of my head, but I ignored it. Something back there was making a connection to my old life.. something. But, I ignored it.

Applejack: "Whull.. it fits! This'un's redheaded as all git out. An' she looks so peaceful. Lahk a lil' angel." She squee'd over them.

K: "Ours'll be born soon, too, honey." I reminded her.

Applejack: "Shore will!" She hugged Spirit, then me.

Dr. Allcome: "Both are very healthy." He nodded. "Mother and foals are doing just fine."

K: "Congrats, man." I patted him on the shoulder.

Forest Spirit: "Thanks." He nodded to me.

Pinkie: "YAY! Now we can have ANOTHER party!" She giggled. "Smaller! Promise!" She zoomed off to get a few things.

And with that, Forest Spirit's foals were born.. my best friend, more or less, that started out as a stuffy Lieutenant unsure of himself, or his role in the world.

New Life.

[End of Part 3]

Part 4: New Beginnings

TIME: 02:22 ERDT
DATE: War Day 688/22 Secundus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Luna's Chambers, Royal Palace, Canterlot
STATUS: Marvin Gaye should be playing right now


We were having a romantic night. Just the two of us. Luna and me. Applejack had been getting a lot of my time, lately, and I didn't want Luna to feel like she was being pushed aside. I'd spent the day with Starlight Mint at the palace.. she wanted to practice shooting and do an obstacle course with Daddy.

She was shaping up to be the best soldier I had, but she was still my daughter.

Right now? My Monkey Ass was bare assed, and we were laying together on a fluffy rug in front of the small fire place in her Chambers.. drinking hot cocoa and listening to a record. Some orchestral piece I'd never heard before.

Really, I was staring into her eyes.

Mind you, we hadn't gotten physical, yet. My nudity was an informality for Luna. The same as her creating a human form for my dream sex sessions. We were.. mutually taking large steps into each other's cultures.

K: "Been almost four years since I got here." I started.

Luna: "Mmm.. four years since the Monkey Sex God conquered The Moon." She nuzzled.

K: "I wasn't called that, yet, though." I gently kissed the side of her muzzle.

Luna: "Mm." She nuzzled again. "But, it was the first night in so long that I felt such love, such tenderness, such.. attraction to another." She smiled warmly, blushing. "And you.. returned it in kind. Especially after we coupled."

K: "I realized I'd developed feelings for you." I shrugged. "I wasn't so sure, at first. And afterwards, I was scared. I was terrified that your sister would be so angry with me, I'd be a fart stain on the floor.. but, worse, that she'd send you back to the Moon or something, for laying with an alien creature." I caressed her face. "Or, you know.. sullying your pure blood with my filthy monkey cum."

She giggled a good bit at that.

Luna: "It's true.. I didn't care of the consequences myself. After I realized that, I, too, might have done something wrong.. I.. I also feared for you over myself. I was more afraid Tia would kill you, than me being sent to the Moon for another thousand years." She smiled, and leaned in, kissing me.

K: "No matter what happens in the future, know that I love you." I held her close, but not tightly.

Luna: "And I, you." She nuzzled in.

We.. kinda.. just did that for the next couple of hours. A little lovey-dovey talk, cuddles, nuzzles, gentle kisses. A real paradise for a few hours. War or no war, this was an important part of our lives. We would not let the time slip by us.

Around 4, both of us got hungry. For.. uh.. modesty sake, I slipped my pants on. Rarity had also made me some lovely slippers, and I put those on, too. We walked through the palace together, chatting, and to the kitchen. Given the war, we hired extra staff to cover the night shift. Before the war.. well.. if there was a staff member awake, they'd help out, but usually, by now, there wasn't.

Staff for the morning didn't get here until almost 5. Luna liked her 4AM snacks. This USED to be a problem.. eh.. when I wasn't around.

Cookster Coriander: "Ah, Princess! K! What can I get you?" He nodded to us as we entered.

K: "Coffee. Extra sweet. Two cups. And a couple Moon Pies. Ohh.. and some chocolate ice cream." I shrugged.

Luna: "Oh, yes!" She beamed. "I would love some." She slid in next to me as we sat at the Chef's Table.

Really, the concept of the Chef's Table is virtually EXTINCT on Earth. The Chef's Table USED to be THE most exclusive seat in a restaurant - it was a normal table, in the kitchen, off to the side, and the VIP sitting there could not only watch Chef prepare their food, but get it ABSOLUTELY as soon as it's done cooking.

Health and Safety Regs killed it. So sad.

In the Palace, the Kitchen had a proper Chef's Table in a small alcove, and was actually big enough for me and Luna to cuddle on one side, and Cel to sit on the other, and our plates not hit each other. We'd done this several times, before Dawn Conferences.

The war itself brought on changes. Not just to how the palace conducted itself, but to how many Staff were here on and off. For large events, we regularly catered, now, for example, rather than place additional strain on the waitstaff. NEIGHTO conferences meant not just Royals or Royal Representatives, but Flag Officers and their attendant Aides de Camp, drivers, assistants, and so on. They all needed fed, and a swimming pool of tea and coffee to sustain them.

Our snacks were served just as Celestia came in, looking.. rough.

K: "Cel.. wow." I blinked. "Frazzled plain hair mane, bags under your eyes.. eh.. is that a damn Cigarette in your mouth!?" She was also in a frumpled bath robe.

Celestia: "..oh, K, Luna.. g'morning.." She slid into the seat across from us. "COFFEE! STRONG!" She said out loud, snuffing the cigarette in the tiny ash tray.

K: "When did you start smoking?" I cocked a brow.

Celestia: "Hundreds of years ago. I only do it if I had a bad night." She rubbed her face with her hooves.

Luna: "Tia.." She reached across the table. "Eyes shut, let me see."

Celestia: "..no." She pulled her legs back.

Luna: "TIA." She was firm.

K: "Cel. Please." I slipped around and pinned her in her seat, putting my arm around her.

Celestia: "Oh, fine." She sighed, and let Luna read her last dream.

Which she shared with me.

It was the Attack on Canterlot, only worse, and she was feeling the pain of the Magic Bombs used to attack the city.. physically feeling it. Death. Seeing so much death. Pain, screaming, hearing their voices, and being like a mother watching her own children be MURDERED.

I held her tightly.

Had this been going on all this time?

K: "Cel.." I nuzzled her.

Luna: "Tia! Sister! No, no.. this.. this will not do." She rubbed Celestia's forehooves over her own muzzle. "You're in pain."

Celestia: "I will deal with it. Mommy ne-"

K: "'Mommy' needs to shut the fuck up because Daddy is going to force her to take a day off." I glared at her. "For your own good. YOU are going to REST." I nodded to Luna. "We'll take over for the day." I waved a familiar sentry over. "Misty. Send a Priority One message to Crystal Palace, inform them that Celestia is under the weather. That's a Code Rosehip Pink, understood?"

Senior Guard Misty Stars: "Yes, General." She nodded and off she went.

Celestia: "..okay, I surrender." She smiled a bit. "And remind me, WHO designed the Emergency Color-Code System, again?"

K: "Toola Roola and Rarity?" I shrugged. "Really, it's a great system. You don't get the connections unless you know fashion and color."

Luna: "She should be here by Noon. Meaning, I will still be able to get in a nap, at least." She nodded.

K: "Yeah, and if you doze off, I'm technically third in charge of the Kingdom's affairs.. I can handle it." I nodded.

Celestia: "This is a mutiny.." She munched one of the moon pies, and dumped some of the ice cream on it. "..but, I give."

K: "Excellent." I gently kissed her snout. "I DO care about you Cel."

Luna: "As do I, Tia." She was very warm with that statement.

Celestia: "At least I know I can take a day off and things not fall to pieces around here." She nodded. "Mmm.. it's so nice to have people that care about ME, for a change."

K: "Yeah, well.. you're our Princess." I hugged her again.

Luna: "Indeed. And MY Sister." She leaned in and rubbed horns with her. "I can scarcely think what the last thousand years were like.. but.. we are here, now, sister. We will always be here."

Celestia: "Th-thank you.. Luna." She smiled, with tears in her eyes.

After a heavy snack, we sent her back to bed to rest. I made it clear that even if she didn't want to sleep, I did NOT want her doing ANY business today.

Even if her and I aren't married or even in a relationship, we have that parental dichotomy. I didn't mind it.. I did see all these Ponies as my responsibility, on some level.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Regally Businessed

TIME: 09:23 ERDT
DATE: War Day 688/22 Secundus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Throne Room, Royal Palace, Canterlot

I was now dressed in my Class A uniform. Not the Formal one, the "Office" Class A. That is, black slacks, black button-down shirt with black tie, black boots, pistol belt. No hat, since I'm indoors. I had a hip-length jacket that went with it, but it was warmish in the Palace, so, I left it off.

K: "Alrighty.." I examined the clipboard brought to me by Raven Inkwell. "..seems pretty standard for an Autocratic ruler. Any who gain an Audience with the Princess are expected to state their problems, and the Princess judges whether they can be helped or not, and how. Also.. we had that strategy briefing earlier, that was nothing major.." I nodded to Jack Galloway as he was getting ready to leave. "..Jack."

Cmr. Galloway: "General." He nodded. "Filling in for Her Highness won't be easy, you know." He gave me a grin, though.

K: "I've got it. Remember, I want you and Chem to torpedo Patty O'Bogs." I wagged a finger at him. "Legally. I want Don Francino to know who the real boss is, and that I'm just being nice."

Galloway: "You know it." He nodded again. "I've wanted a piece of him for some time. Never got it when I was Commissioner of the Committee of Safety in Manehattan." He shrugged. "I didn't have any good detectives. Now.."

K: "Now, you have the best. Catch you later, Jack." I gave him a nod as he departed.

Luna: "We picked well with him, did we not?" She smiled a bit.

K: "Uncle Orange suggested him." I shrugged at her. "He's an old friend, going way back. Bit of Nepotism, sure, but close friends can vet close friends, and these being Ponies, we can trust their judgement more easily." I nodded to Misty Stars. "Go ahead and end your shift, Misty. Make sure you log in that you did two and a half extra hours."

Misty Stars: "Yes, General." She nodded and departed as Ironhide came up.

Ironhide: "We're ready to begin, K." He gestured to the Petitioner's Hallway.

K: "Alright. First case?"

Ironhide: "A farmer from Neighbraska. Dispute between him and the local government." He looked at a clipboard. "The local government wants to sieze some of his land for a construction project."

K: "Eminent Domain issue. Alright, show them in." I gestured.

Ironhide: "PETITIONERS! YOU MAY ENTER!" He called them all in.

This was a "first come, first serve" sort of deal. A block of Petitions would be scheduled each day - these being ponies, it was never really all that many - and each would be tended to according to a list.

Before the war, Celestia RARELY had any issues finishing the list each day. Should that happen, though, the Crown was responsible for paying out any differences in travel costs, and providing Room and Board to the Petitioners, and scheduling them first for the next day.

In came a farmer, dressed in clean overalls and a blue checkered shirt, and a.. stallion with slicked back hair, a sport coat, ascot, and loafers on his rear hooves.

I could see immediately that the farmer felt comfortable with his Goddesss, while the other man felt this was a formal business event. The mentality struck me.

K: "Ironhide." I nodded.

Ironhide: "Petitioners, state your names." He nodded.

Famer: "Husker Cornrow, Your Majesty." He nodded to Luna.

Developer: "Grin Flashley, Your Majesty."

K: "Ooo.." I looked at Luna, she nodded to me to take charge of this one. "..let's hear the case."

Ironhide: "Husker Cornrow owns 17 acres of farmland adjoining the Soup River near Cushioning. Grin Flashley represents the Hayward County Defense Development Association. They propose to construct a defense plant along the river for the production of Scandium-Alloy for the F/A-1 Falcon and future projects."

K: "State your cases." I pointed to Husker.

Husker: "I admit, sir, I don't farm that section of my acreage. I don't have any foals to farm it with me. M'son joined the Air Force, stationed at Cloudsdale Air Force Base.. ah.. that's him in the Gallery - Sergeant Dazey Cornrow - and so, yes'ir, I don't have the ability t'farm that area just now. But, after the war, Celestia willing, my son'll come back t'me and I can farm that again." He stated plainly, but respectfully.

Grin: "Sir, I represent the Hayward County Defense Development Association. We've secured a deal with Sirecorksy Aircraft to construct a metal foundry somewhere in the county, to supply them with metal skin for aircraft. Currently, they're a contractor for the F/A-1 Falcon, but as I understand, more aircraft will enter production soon." He nodded, speaking smoothly. "We hope to employ 400 ponies at the plant."

K: "M'kay. And this is the part where I figure out who gets what. SERGEANT! Front and Center, Flyer!" I ordered.

He marched dutifully forwards, standing in the middle, and snapped smartly to attention.

Sgt. Dazey Cornrow: "Yes, SIR, General!"

K: "Do you intend to go back to the life of a simple farmerpony after the war?" I nodded to him.

Sgt. Dazey Cornrow: "I do, sir." He nodded. "It's why I joined up. I want to have a land left to FARM, sir."

K: "Alright." I looked at Grin. "And, you say you have a possible contract."

Grin: "I do." He nodded to me.

K: "Alright. How.. do you intend to transport the completed parts?" I cocked a brow at him.

Grin: "I.. that's not within my purview." He shrugged.

K: "That's not good enough, sir. You are asking the Crown to take land from this man. You say you have a good reason, but you don't seem to know what the details are. Whilst Eminent Domain has been used since the War began to construct defensive fortification, defense plants, and the like, this Crown will absolutely not deprive a private citizen of Land without an exceptional reason. Your reason is incomplete." I shrugged. "The Crown sides with Husker Cornrow. Eminent Domain is denied. Moreover, Grin, I strongly suggest you, instead, seek to construct a Defense Plant closer to a highly populated area, with good existing rail or river barge transportation and shipping capability. I expect we won't hear about this again." That was a statement.

Grin: "But, I-"

K: "NO buts! That is the decision of this Crown." I nodded to Ironhide. "Dismiss them. Sergeant, under my authority as Commanding General, I give you the rest of the day as Liberty to see your father."

Sgt. Cornrow: "Thank you, General!" He saluted.

Husker Cornow: "Thank you, General." He nodded.

Ironhide: "Petitioners dismissed." He snorted.

To be honest, THAT one probably would have crossed me or Luna's desk ANYWAY. Fortuitous that they were Petitioners today. Anything related to Defense fell to me and her as it was.

Most of the other cases that day were just as boring and uninteresting. Mainly land disputes between neighbors that we worked out with shifting property lines around. One case involved a pet pig, and we had to call in Fluttershy to get the pig's testimony on the matter. THAT case was easy - the Pet Pig wanted to be with the first party, who had raised it, and objected to being sold. The second party was displeased, and while money was an issue, I personally paid the difference, just to settle the case.

As expected, Cadence showed up at Noon so Luna could get a nap in before nightfall. Sunshine and I spent the lunch hour gossping like little old ladies at a Church social. He'd been at Redheart's Baby Shower, but the poor man had been chained to his wife the whole time, and held up as a perfect example of how NOT to pay attention to social class, and that Good Stallions were everywhere.


TIME: 14:47 ERDT

Fluttershy: "I had no idea Celestia was so busy during the day!" She "hmm'd" a bit, seemingly in a happy place.

K: "Neither did I." I shrugged. "I kinda expected this, though. Ironhide, anything else?"

Ironhide: "Yes, one last case.. a foal custody matter." He nodded.

K: "Interesting. Don't we have something like a family court to decide this?" I shrugged.

Ironhide: "We do, but, this case has been through both Family and Appellate Court, and both parties have traded rulings for the last six months. The foal in question was the one that made the Petition." He nodded.

K: "Oh, goodness! This one sounds legitimately serious. Send them in!"

Cadence: "I hate cases like this. Families shouldn't be fighting.." She sighed.

The petitioners came in. There were three Parties - the foal that made the Petition, and two sets of married adults, one clearly older.

Ironhide: "The Petitioner is Sandy Trotley. Party One is Mr. Fusion and Mrs. Diamond Trotley, biological grandparents of Sandy. Party Two is Mr. Sunbottom Clearskies, and Mrs. Opal Clearskies. For clarification, Diamond Trotley and Opal Clearskies are aunt and niece, maiden name, Gemcutter. The Clearskies are the biological Aunt and Uncle of Sandy, through Opal. Opal's sister, Emerald, was Sandy's mother."

K: "Quite the family tree. Where is this coming from?" I tilted my head.

Ironhide: "Mmm.. Ketchup, Shoshone." Or, the Earth state of Idaho.

K: "Quite a long distance." I nodded. "Let's start with you, young lady." I nodded to Sandy. "Tell me your story."

Sandy: "Well.. my dad died here in Canterlot at the start'a th' war. He'd joined up as a Guard." She nodded a bit. "My mom died later on. She got real sick.."

Opal Clearskies: "She wouldn't have, if I'd been there!"

K: "Mrs. Clearskies? Sit down and be silent. You're not the one the Court is interviewing at this juncture." I looked over the rim of my glasses to her.

Opal: *HorseSnort* "Fine!" She sat, and crossed her forelegs.

K: "Go on, young lady." I nodded to her.

Sandy: "Well.." She huffed. "..Aunt Opal and Uncle Sun wanted to adopt me. They owns a real nice beauty parlor in Poppytella. Biggest in town! All'a th' nice ladies 'n gentlecolts go there. Problem is.. that isn't me, sir! That isn't me at all! I'm no Lady!" She huffed, and frowned. "Then, there's my grandfolks." She nodded to Diamond and Fusion. "They wants me, too. Problem is.. they wants to put me to work in the Potato Fields! They ain't got none-"

K: "'Haven't any,' young lady." I nodded to her. "I know you're smart enough to use proper Equestrian." My tone was warm and fatherly.

Sandy: "Uh.. yes, sir. Uh. They haven't any more children around to farm it themselves. They can barely clear three acres! But, I don't wanna slave 'way digging potatoes." She frowned again. "Ain't - UH! No one's asked me what I want!"

K: "And, what do you want?" I asked, simply.

Sandy: "I wanna be like my Dad and be a Royal Guard!" She puffed herself up. "Three more years'n I'll be old enough for the Junior Cadets."

K: "You're 12, then." I nodded. "Well, you're certainly old enough to register an opinion about what you want. Have you gotten your Cutie Mark, yet?"

Sandy: "Sure have!" She pulled up her dress and showed it off.

It was a mace head, striking a shield.

K: "Interesting." I nodded.

Cadence: "Let's hear from Party One. The grandparents." She nodded.

Fusion Trotley: "We farm p'tatahs. S'what we do." He blinked a bit. "We's Sandy's grandfolks. She ought'n be with us. Bein'a  guard's silly. Her bloodline's all p'tatahs." He shrugged. "Dunno where that thar Guard business come from. Pro'l'ly lernt it at school. Dun need no more school'n t'grow p'tatahs."

He was a simple Stallion, I could see that.

K: "Ma'am." I nodded to her.

Fusion: "What'ch'a'dressin' her fer?" He looked at me.

K: "I want.. to hear what she has to say. Your wife. Sir." I nodded.

Fusion: "Mm.. don't s'why.." He shrugged, but nudged her forwards.

Diamond: "As my husband said. We farm. It's her birthright. She needs to settle down and find a husband in a few years, anyhow." She said, a little timid, like it wasn't her place to speak.

K: "Uh-huh.." I cast a side-glance to Sunshine and Cadence.. like.. calm down, you two. Neither of them were happy. "..and the Clearskies? Ma'am, since you saw fit to register an opinion so eagerly, let's start with you."

Her husband was behind her, and had not looked any of us in the eye since this started.

Opal: "Well. I want to ask something important, first!" She snorted again.

K: "O..kay?" I tilted my head.

Opal: "Why are we not before Princess Celestia? Or at least her younger sister?! Why YOU!? Why the Pet Monkey?!" She glared at me.

Her husband outright cowered when she raised her voice.

K: "Okay, you know what?" I nodded to Ironhide. "Neither of you are going to take custody of her-"

Opal: "EXCUSE ME?!?" She just about screamed.

K: "Ironhide." I nodded.

Two Guards moved over to her, and pushed her back.

K: "It's the decision of this Petition to Court that neither of you will be her Guardians. Firstly, Mister Trotley, you're a mysoginistic fossil. Your views may have been accepted in your day, they certainly are not, any longer. I won't have a child  possibly physically abused, and certainly, there's a possiblity she'll have all her Agency taken from her." I looked at Opal. "You're kinda the reverse, but you're rude, and your behavior verges on Treason." I glared at her. "Calling me a Pet Monkey at Court is mockery of a royal official. I fine you 500 Bits. You want to call me a Pet Monkey, it's your right to do so - IN THE STREETS! NOT here!" I nodded to Sunbottom. "YOU, sir, seem so henpecked, you've lost YOUR spine as much as Diamond has lost HERS!" I waved my hand.

Opal: "YOU IGNORANT APE!" She yelled.

K: "One thousand bits. Keep it up, the next step is 10 days in the Stockade."

Cadence: "Oh.. I'd increase it to 15 days." She put in. "Insulting NEIGHTO's Commander like this, I believe, carries additional punishment."

Opal: "What.. what leave do YOU have to speak over Equestrian affiars, Princess Whoresalot?!" She screeched at her.

Cadence: "Oh, you did NOT-"

Sunshine: "-INSULT MY WIFE-"

K: "GUARDS! REMOVE HER AT ONCE! SIX MONTHS IN THE DUNGEON! HAY AND WATER! CHARGE - SLANDER AND LIBEL AGAINST A FOREIGN ROYAL HEAD OF STATE!" I yelled, but held my arm in front of Sunshine, who wanted to punch her snout through the back of her head.

She tried to struggle free, but two guards tackled her, thumped her over the head, chained her, and dragged her out of the Throne Room. The remaining Guards escorted the others out, as well. Except Sandy.

After a minute, composure and bearing was regained.

K: "Sandy, I want to find you someone to take care of you. You might be fated to be a Guard or a Soldier, but you're only 12. You need to finish growing, first." I nodded to her.

Sandy: "Aw.." She nodded, though. "Ah'm sorry my Aunt got like that."

K: "And humble!" I chuckled.

Ironhide: "General, if I may?" He stepped up.

K: "Yes, Guard Commander." I nodded to him.

Ironhide: "I'd like to Foster her, sir. Me and my wife have a daughter about her age, and a Son two years younger." He nodded to Sandy.

K: "Sandy?" I looked at her.

Sandy: "SOLD!" She beamed.

K: "Then it's the ruling of this Court Petition that Sandy Trotley be Fostered by Commander of the Royal Guard, Ironhide, and his family, until she comes of age to join the Equestrian Military in pursuit of her dream." I nodded.

Cadence: "For certain!" She beamed.

Sandy: "AHHA!" She tapped her little hooves. "I'm so happy! Thank you, everyone!"

Further proof that issues still arise, and there IS still strife in this world, on a small and personal scale, and it's not always in the best interest of the children caught in the familial crossfire.. to even stay with the family.

If only my world could be so thorough.
