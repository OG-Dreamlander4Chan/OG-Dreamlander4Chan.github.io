Part 1: Unresolution

TIME: 07:11 NCT
DATE: War Day 923/17 Decemus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: HMS Harrow of the Sands, off Jakarta, Dutch East Indies


I was on board one of the smaller auxiliary vessels the Navy had taken over at the start of the war. On the trip over, it'd carried troops and equipment. On the way back, it'd carry whatever expatriates from North Equus had been in Jakarta and the East Indies that we'd saved. Civilians.

Among them.. was Dusk's father an Filthy Rich.

They were sharing a cabin in the rear of the vessel, part of a group set aside for the wounded.

Dr. Knochen: "AHH! HERR K!" He stepped right up and hugged me. "Vee meet again!"

K: "Doc!" I beamed a grin. "Joined the NEIGHTO Medical Corps?"

Dr. Knochen: "Ja. Me and mein liebschen." He bushed just a bit. "Zere ist a bit of romance, even at our age, being travelling doctor unt nurse on international adventure!"

Bruchelda: "HERR K!" She trotted up and hugged me as well. "Wu bist du? How you are?"

K: "Doing fine, ma'am." I accepted the hug, and gestured to Steela. "This is Steela Oresdottir."

Steela: "Gut tag." She nodded a curt bow.

K: "..and my friend Dusk Seeker." I gestured to him. "My wife, and Rarity, you know."

Dusk: "Sir. Ma'am." He nodded to them.

Applejack: "Howdy!" She grinned as well, and gave them both hugs.

Rarity: "Darlings." She bowed a bit to them.

The NEIGHTO International Medical Corps was a common resource pool for the rest of NEIGHTO for the conflict. It was Fluttershy's idea to simply have all the NEIGHTO medical units more or less in one bucket, so we could draw whomever we needed for whatever mission.

In this case, the IMC had sent a detachment of medical personnel that had been on staff at Naval Hospital Fillydelphia. As Dr. Knochen explained, he and his wife were undergoing training there - she needed to learn Equestrian better, for one. He? Needed a refresher on true emergency medicine.

As AJ and Steela made with the familiarizations with our old friends, Dusk slipped away. I didn't notice, at first, but Rarity went with.

Me? I listened at the door.

Filthy: "..I redouble-Ah! Visitors."

Dusk: "Mister Rich. .. .. Father."

Brindle: "Dusk." He cleared his throat, I could hear. "This.. isn't exactly private."

Dusk: "Yes, and? Were our fights ever?"

Brindle: "..your point."

Dusk: "Look.. dad.." He sighed hard. "..we said a lot of things. Things I know we never meant. Remember.. the time when I was seven? We had that.. heh.. adventure getting across Lake Michigami in that small boat?"

Brindle: "OH! Yes!" He chortled. "We nearly capsized."

Dusk: "But, we had fun in the end, right? And we.. learned to trust each other."

Brindle: "We did."

Dusk: "..then, I joined the Guard." He skipped ahead.

Brindle: "You did."

Dusk: "You saw my Mark, Dad. I'm.. I'm not like you, or grandpa. I'm.. I'm a Guard. A Solider. More than that, I'm now in CAG." Another hard sigh. "I've saved lives, Dad."

Brindle: "..yeah, I suppose you have." He was a touch bitter about this.

Dusk: "I'm.. not.. asking forgiveness. Stay mad. It's okay. But.. you're my father. I.." A pause. "..still love you." His voice was more vulnerable than I'd ever heard it.

Brindle: "Eh.."

Filthy: "Go on, ol' friend." His voice was uncharacteristically soft, too.

Brindle: "You're my son. I love you, too." He sounded choked up.

Dusk: "All I was askin' for, Dad." His voice had relief and pain in it.

Brindle: "You.. any good?" The fatherly instinct - did I raise him to be the best? Is MY SEED a superior one?

Dusk: "I'm.. a good shot."

Rarity: "I'd say he's the second best sniper in Equestria, Brindle. Behind ME, of course." She sounded softly haughty.. then dropped it. "His knowledge of the area saved hundreds of lives. His courage saved a young fawn from being kidnapped yesterday. He's not just any good, sir. He's one of the best."

Brindle: "Impartial.." *Small cough* "..opinion."

Dusk: "Best you'll get unless my boss was here."

Rarity: "Hush, he's not our boss. K is our friend."

Brindle: "You.. you're doing alright, son." Another pause. "After the dragon thing.. I-I-I got so mad.. I.." *Small cough* "..thought I'd lost you and it was my fault, some how!"

Dusk: "No, Dad. It.. I made a mistake. I won't make another like that. I've learned. Because you taught me so much."

Brindle: "I'll.. I'll take that."

Rarity: "Anyway, dearlings, let us not keep your father from his rest. I can hear breakfast coming."

Dusk: "Yeah.. uh.. I'll see you later, Dad." Another pause. "I promise."

Brindle: "You'd better, colt!" He sounded harsh.. but love was there.

This.. was the REAL reason I came aboard. Oh, I made the excuse that I wanted to check on the Civilians, sure, but.. this was the real reason. Rarity had, in fact, prodded me to do it. Something about unresolved parental trauma.

I understood.


TIME: 09:17 NCT
LOCATION: HMS Rainbow of Light, off Jakarta, Dutch East Indies

Back aboard my flagship.. and I was enjoying the Command Area. All the CAG quarters faced a series of three large rooms. The one towards the aft was our dining area and planning tables (the planning tables converted into dining tables). The middle section was the reception lounge to meet guests. The area forwards was a "common room" sort of area that branched off to the two shower rooms. While each of our Quarters had its own head (Naval slang for a toilet), for plumbing reasons, we had three showering rooms. They were unisex and it was more "who grabbed which room first" and they had little signs next to them.

I did find it interesting that - thanks partly to the innocence and culture of the world - same-gender ponies had no qualms about showering with one another. And I don't just mean among friends. They literally had no personal barrier there that made it 'rude' in any way. I chalked that up, partly, to the whole "herd mentality" thing.

At the moment, I was seated at a desk in the Common Area, looking over some paperwork. Communiques, mainly. The Ambleonian Fleet and the Canidan Fleet had met up and were 72 hours from arrival. I'd changed the invasion plan - to take pressure off the Equestrian Marines, I'd have them stay put on Java and back up the over-land push to Surabaya.

Ambleonian and Canidan Marines would, instead, be my spearhead on Sumatra. I just didn't think they'd get here in time, and I didn't want to delay operations here too long, lest Tirek inject new resources.

Right about then, I noticed Broken Dawn pacing in, using his wings to hold a book, as he wrote with his muzzle.

K: "What'cha got there, Ell-Tee?" I smirked.

Broken: "HM!?" He looked up, suddenly, then.. blushed. "Jest meh personal thoughts, K."

K: "I'm curious." I shrugged. "You're a philosopher. First one I've had along. What's going on in your head space, my dude?"

Broken looked at me, blinked, and seemed to decide that, yes, maybe I really would understad, and took a seat on the couch near the desk.

Broken: "Why do'ye do it?" He leaned in, absolutely pure academic curiosity in his voice. "Why risk yer life fer us? We.. we're.. not sentient in yer world, right? Why?"

K: "Ah.." I nodded, looking down. "I have a wife in the human world. Her name is J--. We both loved the show you guys came from. All the generations of it. It was something special to both of us. Something we bonded over. When I arrived here without her.." I blinked. "..I found her equivalent in Pony terms. Applejack." And shrugged a tiny bit. "It doesn't matter to me that you're ponies, Broke." I leaned a bit towards him. "My religion is similar to Celestianism. A few differences, but the general message of being a good person is there. Plenty of stuff about salvation and all that. That's one thing. My Faith demands of me that I be a good person and help. My personal beliefs.. I see you.. all of you.. as no different than me. Where it counts. On the inside. I have knowledge and experience that can help prevent the deaths of SO.. so many.." I gestured. "Remember that fawn?"

Broken: "Aye, I see.. but.. I mean.. sacrifice yourself? You mentioned that.." He grimaced a bit. "..was the back-up plan."

K: "My world is not nearly as innocent and pure as this one, Broke. Not.." I looked down at the floor. "..by a long shot. There's a lot of negativity there." I nodded. "Like I said, I see you all as the same as me - worthy of every chance to be happy and safe." I shrugged a bit. "I'd do anything to protect all of you. Partly because of those Universal Rules I talk about - I'm here for a reason, and if that reason is to die to save everyone's lives, I'd do it without a second thought. So that each one of you can live your lives safe.. and happy."


Broken: "But.. why?" He leaned a bit further in, raising his eyebrows.

K: "Mmm.." I smiled and wagged my finger at him. "..because. Because I care. Why do I care? Because I like you. All of you. It's altruism to self destruction - I'm self-aware of that. I won't get to see the rewards for my virtue. That's fine with me. I have absolute faith that it will be positive. If I've left this world a better place, then I've done something overall positive in the universe. I've made somepony happy. That.. that is my 'selfish reward' - that's what you were asking, wasn't it?" I turned towards him, grinning wide.

Broken: "As expected of the great General K, nearly a legend in his own time, even dabbles a wee bit in philosophy." He smirked back, fully in his element. "And understands the concepts."

K: "Nah, don't expect me to be a legend. I'm fine being a footnote in a history book, as long as those that've suffered and died are remembered, and their sacrifices a lesson for the future." I shrugged, almost flapping my arms. "But, who can say what the future really holds? There was a pivotal battle in my world, 950 years ago from my perspective, that changed literally everything. Do we know the names of all those involved? No. Do we fully understand the sacrifice? No. Was there a lesson here, that we're missing? Maybe." I looked at him. "I don't want these lessons, paid in blood, to EVER be forgotten. Ponies must never, ever lose the bonds of Friendship. Not like this. Not ever again."

Broken: "Fascinating."

Broken was an interesting pony. I was going to enjoy having someone around that can ask me these kinds of questions.


TIME: 11:38 NCT

A bit later, I was helping get the dining area ready for lunch. We'd be doing a bit of training and practice in the afternoon, just to make sure everyone was on point. So, a decent but not overly heavy lunch.

Maud, then, came in, with Rose Pompadour.

Maud: "K." She stated my name, and moved over to me. "The truth will out."

K: "..it will." I nodded, not looking at her, but staring straight ahead.

Everyone came in at this point. Twilight and Raven were talking, but Twilight froze when she saw Rose.

Rose, in turn, ducked back and hid behind Maud.

Maud: "Twilight Sparkle." She didn't move or turn her head.

Twilight: "Ah.. y-yes, Maud?" She paced over a bit closer.

Maud barely turned towards her, produced Boulder from his pouch, and VERY GENTLY tossed Boulder at her head. It barely made a noise as it thumped between her Draconic horns, at the base of her Unicorn horn, bounced off, and hit the deck.

Twilight's lip quivered, and she immediately fell to her belly, quietly crying.

Gilda: "What the Tartarus is going on here?" She whispered to her wife.

Dash: "The truth, Gild." She blinked, and got serious, stepping forwards. "Look, everypony. You all know Maud's alive, now. K and I have been keeping a secret from all of you." She shuffled her hooves. "When we went to Baleston, we found Maud. Alive. Normal. Spunky, too." She shrugged her wings. "She asked us to tell Pinkie that she was dead. And pretend she was."

Applejack then stepped forwards.

Applejack: "Y'all kinda know how this happened. Well, Pinkie found this here pool'a duplicatin' an' all.. before the war, y'see? Well, she done made DOZENS of herself. Was a right nasty problem. Twilight fixed it-" She was cut off.

Rose: "..by killing us." She finished. "We.. weren't ourselves, yet, though. But.. it didn't take us long." She started tearing up. "I don't know how many of my sisters were sisters when they were popped by Twilight's magic. But, I saw it happen!" She lowered herself to the deck, too. "And you know. I was scared! I didn't want to die!" She lifted her skirt edge to show her Cutie Mark - it HAD chaged! It was no longer three balloons, but three glow sticks. "I'm my OWN pony!"

K: "She is." I nodded. "I mean, the Cute Mark change is proof, right, Cody?" I nodded to him.

Dr. Allcome: "It most certainly is." He paced up a bit. "Cutie Marks are an extension of our inner selves. Those of you that've seen.. and.. 'extracted' pony.. remember, the Cutie Mark disappears. That does not happen upon a normal death." And lowered his head. "It does happen if you die and are reborn, as with-"

Radio Active: "Me." She paced up, with Norfy. "I changed. I don't know all of it, but I'm very different, now." She gently muzzle-nudged Rose. "I kinda.. know how you feel?"

Rose: "Thank you, Radio.." She looked up, and they nuzzled.

Twilight: "..I did something horrible." She was looking at Boulder. "I.. I can't ask.." And up to Maud, who was already directly in front of her.

Maud then bowed her head and nuzzled Twilight affectionately. Then, so did Rose.

Maud: "You made a miscalculation based on incomplete evidence and fear. Fear of losing someone you treasured. I am.. honored.. that my sister has had such dear friends, that would make that kind of a.. judgment." She blinked several times. "I would.. couldn't ask.. but.. Boulder.. would like to be in-"

Twilight: "YES!" And she leapt up and hugged her. "I would LOVE to be your freind, Maud!"

K: "We all would." I smiled a bit.

So, more unresolved trauma gets brought out into the open. War makes wounds, but wounds can be inflicted even during peace. It's up to us, as friends, to forgive, forget, move on, and build stronger bonds.

As I constantly, constantly say: Friendship is Magic.

[End of Part 1]

Part 2: The Trixie Effect

TIME: 17:21 NCT
DATE: War Day 923/17 Decemus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: HMS Rainbow of Light, off Jakarta, Dutch East Indies


We had finished our day's practice. Everyone took turns as we turned the aft part of the ship into an ad-hoc training facility and obstacle course. Special low velocity ammunition with light ceramic bullets designed to pulverize on impact with nearly anything solid (my take on "SiMunitions") was used for some live fire training.

In close quarters with each other.

Obviously, everyone's wearing goggles and padding, but it still hurts to get hit with one. A LOT. Typhoon learned that when an errant shot hit in in the flank and actually penetrated his skin a bit. Nothing major, but a reminder we needed to be careful.

Now, I was sitting in the Ward Room of the VIP quarters with Twilight and the others, as we went over a few things we noticed we'd slacked on.

Twilight: "..Derpy.." She started.

Derpy: "Yeah, Twi?!" She lifted her head up from her husband's lap.

Twilight: "Remember when you explained about Trixie?" She blinked at her.

Derpy: "Yeah! Yeah.." She blinked, too, and lowered her head. "..yeah."

Twilight: "The bonds of friendship. Weakening. Forgetting ourselves." She looked at Bright Eyes. "Tirek and other calamities coming when.. things.. get strained."

Bright Eyes: "What are you thinking about Twilight?" She tilted her head, with Teddy next to her.

Twilight: "We.." She looked at Fluttershy, Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash. "..made a mistake."

Rainbow Dash: "What're you talking about?" She cocked a brow.

Twilight: "We.." She sighed and lowered her head. "..we pushed Trixie away." And raised it. "It's our fault that Trixie felt.. so froze out.. so.. disliked." And shook her head sadly. "If we hadn't. If we'd.. FORGIVEN her.. INVITED her in.." She lowered herself to the ground. "..made her a friend, instead of rejecting her when she was at her weakest.." She looked at me. "Maybe she wouldn't have betrayed us to Tirek."

K: "I'd say that's a very solid connection, Twi, knowing how you all think and feel." I shrugged.

Twilight: "Then.. we failed her." She nodded, firmly. "I think a good way to describe this.. weakened bond of friendship.. is to call it The Trixie Effect. The Trixie Effect occurs when someone is rejected instead of included. Specifically that they are not forgiven and invited in, after some kind of incident. Some kind of.." She shook her head. "..disagreement or problem. That society, and the people they affected, turn their backs on them. This caused by the weakened bonds of friendship. And the.." She looked at Bright Eyes. "..forgetting ourselves. Forgetting who we are, what we are.. our culture.."

Applejack: "Our faith." She nodded. "The Celestian Bible preaches fergiveness, Twi." She frowned a bit. "Gosh darn it.. y'd think as much as I read it, I'd'a remembered that." Her voice was low.

K: "That's the problem. That's.. whatever's causing the Trixie Effect. It creates these situations. And in order to break through it, those present have to have the presence of mind to REJECT the impluse to eject the offending pony or person.. and embrace them instead." I shrugged.

Twilight: "Very good, K!" She nodded.

Luna: "Indeed. My General has learned much in the ways of friendships.. our ways." She slid a wing around me.

Doctor Whooves: "OUR ways indeed." He cocked a brow at me. "Maybe I should have learned this.. a.. long time ago." And smiled.

K: "We all should have. Like, this is something that should have been at the forefront of at least YOUR minds, maybe not mine. I mean, it is now.." I shrugged a bit.

Rarity: "Because you are now one of us, darling." She nodded to me.

Raven: "Indeed he is!" She raised up, smiling proudly. "We didn't reject him because of him being human.." She looked around a bit, then rubbed her chin with her fetlock. "..maybe we DID break through the Trixie Effect a bit?"

Rose: "That's a good thought, Raven." She put in.

Toola Roola: "I mean, I noticed it myself." She shrugged, putting the finishing touches on a painting. "Since I started wandering, I.. I noticed ponies slowly grew colder. Like, it varied from place to place. Vanhoover, Wenatchee? Very friendly, very welcoming, very open. Boise, Shoshone? Cold. Like, unforgiving. I remember I.. I bumped into this display stand, and the shop owner was really cross with me." She frowned.

K: "So, it's a measurable effect." I nodded. "Now that's a legacy to leave - a Great and Powerful Legacy. That we should all be on guard, and not just reject others because of a mistake." I gestured. "If I'm allowed to stay here after we win, of course.. it's something I'm not going to forget. The Trixie Effect. Lack of forgiveness." I raised my coffee. "Let's forgive her now, then. And accept our own fault in it. Whatever caused us to push her away. Let us remember the pain that can cause. Let us never forget that this can lead to incredible tragedy."

They raised their cups of whatever, and we gave a solemn promise. Now that we were aware of it, maybe we could see THROUGH it?

Trixie, thus, would be remembered as someone that betrayed ponykind. But not that she did so out of pure malice, but from a wounded heart, desperation, and pain. That this pain was because she was rejected, not forgiven and immediately helped. A cautionary tale, a tragic tale.

Maybe her suffering would be so that nopony else would have to?

I had everyone with me. Everyone in CAG that would be in the invasion to Palembang. That included my three newest additions to the team. Once I got on the deck, though..

Admiral Labrador: "GENERAL K!" She very un-Admiral-like jumped up and put her paws on my shoulders. "Oh, I'm SO GLAD to see you!" And nuzzled me.

Like a dog might, just to point that out.

K: "I'm glad to see you, too, Misty!" I beamed a grin. "Who's a good dog?" I immediately, without thinking, gave her ear skritchies and rubbed along her cheeks.

She did not object.

Havoc: "BUDDEH!"

I was tackled to the flight deck, and my face licked.

Havoc: "Miss me, buddy?!" He hugged me, as Bella helped me up.

K: "I sure did!" I smiled a mile wide as the rest of his team came pacing up.

Lt. Barker: "We're so glad to see you're safe, K." He nodded.

Sgt. O'Fang: "Oh, yeah! You make'a friend'a Canid, we're pals fer life." He smiled. "Miss Applejack."

Applejack: "Ah'm happy t'see'yall too!" She passed hugs around. "Oh, this here's Steela Oresdottir an' Teeka-"

Teeka: "Teeka is Great Hyoomin K's Personal Aide! K fight One Over All! And Teeka serve!" She bowed a bit. "Even if he not want all of Aide's service."

Most of the Canids looked at me, nodded to the side, or shrugged, "getting it" immediately.

K: "Man, I'm so happy to see all of you." I shrugged, as Seven and his Foxes stepped up. "Seven." I nodded to him.

Seven: "We hitched a ride. Our fleet had an engagement along with the Polelish about.. almost a month ago, I found out. They caught us lacking, so, we're making some changes." He shrugged.

Admiral Labrador: "And the Eyesores taught us our designs weren't as good as they could be, so, Equestria helped us make some upgrades, too." She nodded.

K: "Oh, and let me introduce Elsie Bon Voyage, of the Stars and Sparkles." I pushed her a bit ahead of me.

Elsie: "Admiral." She nodded to her, with a smile.

Admiral Labrador: "Admiral Misty Labrador, Chief of Operations of the Canidan Republic Navy." She offered a paw, and they shook. "This is Captain Havoc and his team, of the Canidan Rangers, and Seven Devils of the Vulpesylvanian Special Forces, and his team. Our most honored guests."

Elsie: "Pleasure to meet you all!" Shetapped her hooves a bit. "Man, I never thought I'd get to meet such interesting people!"

K: "Mm." I shrugged. "Even in the tragedy of war, we can make good friends." I nodded. "So, I see Canida has a second Carrier, now?"

Admiral Labrador: "We sure do. And with Equestria's help, we have a better stowage of aircraft. It's still going to be a little lighter and lower endurance, but, it'll get the job done. We brought two Heavy Cruisers, four Light Cruisers, four Destroyers, and four Frigates. Plus, the Canidan Forces Maritime Brigade in four Assault Landing Ships." She shrugged, leading us inside as a pair of CS-1 Hounds were preparing to take off.

K: "Prince Blueblood will be here in less than an hour. When he arrives, I want to go over the invasion plan. Canida and Ambleon will tackle this invasion themselves. You'll have backup from an Equestrian Marine Raider Regiment, but this is mostly your job." I said, following her.

Admiral Labrador: "I understand. This is our one chance to get some amphibious landing experience.." She paused. "..before we go after Tirek."

K: "Yeah.. that's.. that's not going to be fun." I shrugged. "Whenever we do that, I anticipate a gigantic landing operation that I can't possibly direct from the rear."

Elsie: "How gigantic?" She tilted her head, as she followed.

K: "On the order of each nation participating having to land a full Division on the initial beach heads, and up to 60% fatalities from those divisions." I said, grimly. "The nearest analogue I have is a similar invasion during that great war I mentioned, that humans nicknamed D-Day. Several tens of thousands of troops were landed, and about a third or so of them became casualties. It was bad. We're going to get it worse, I figure - maybe not the initial landing operation, since I probaby.. with enough scouting.. can figure out where to correct those mistakes.. but soon afterwards, when we get off the beach, and our main artillery is starting to get out of range. That's going to be the hardest part." I shrugged as we entered the spacious Ward Room of the RCS Snow Dome.

There was food set out for us all - both Pony and Canid options - along with coffee and tea, and several attendants.

Admiral Labrador: "Make the General a Roast Beef, please." She nodded to them. "We have Aurochs, too. I understand you encountered some in the frozen north?"

K: "We did." I nodded.

Fluttershy: "O-Oh.." She blinked, and inspected the beef a bit. "..they aren't Cowreans."

Havoc: "Nope." He nodded to her. "We Canidans need meat, and plenty of it. We really don't like the taste of pony, though." He shrugged.

Twilight: "MMhh..! One of the most annoying things about being a Dragon.. partly.. is the craving for meat." She blinked, shrugged, and looked at the Attendant building my sandwich. "Make that two, please."

Luna: "Mmm.." She was sniffing at the salad bar. "..Crystal Greens?"

Admiral Labrador: "Close cousin of them, we call them Lilly Greens, though they're closer to Kale, don'cha'know? There's also some Cat's Grass there, and fresh Amber Oats." She smiled.

Applejack: "Amber Oats?" She paced over and had a look. "Well, boy howdy! You know how pricey this'un can be, in Equestria?"

Admiral Labrador: "I have no idea!" She shrugged. "We eat oats in limited quantity as a hot cereal, mixed with milk, butter, and sweet cream, usually."

Rainbow Dash: "It's like twice as expensive as white oats." She shrugged. "I think it was.. like.. 24 bits a kilo before the war, right, Rarity?"

Rarity: "For the middling yellows, yes. The.." She was making some up for herself. "..high quality Ambers like this would be about 30."

Havoc: "They're like.. five bones a kilo." He chuckled a bit.

Yes, the DOGS have a system of money named BONES. Because of the war, Raven had worked out a monetary exchange of 1:1 between NEIGHTO partners for top-level monetary exchanges between governments. For the pony or dog on the ground, the purchasing power parity favored Equestria by about 12%.

Sooo.. in layman's terms, one Bit was worth 1.12 Bones. Since the Bit and Bone are the only monetary unit (1 bit being like 1 penny), the actual exchange would be 9 Bits to 10 Bones. Meaning, two Kilos of these top quality Oats would cost 18 Bits in Equestrian currency, or 60% of the price in Equestria for the same thing.

Rarity: "..and such good quality.." She said, getting some fruit in hers, and getting a few griddle cakes as well. "..oh, I shouldn't." She said, looking at the whipped cream.

Dusk: "Hey, we could die in the next 24 hours." He shrugged, heaping his plate with a little bit of everything, though he declined the chance at beef, and went with some chicken instead.

Again, very on point - lean protein. I smirked a bit, looking at the food choices of my friends, and seeing Rarity stealthily (not!) lean back for some whipped cream.

I sat with my meal - a roast beef sandwich, eggs, bacon, toast, shredded potatoes, and some amber oat oatmeal with a bit of fruit in it, and some sweet cream. It was.. notably better than the oats I was used to eating and a DAMN sight better than ration oats.

Twilight: "I'm just not used to eating so many meats." She sighed, and nibbled the sandwich.. realized how good it was, and then tried it dipped in the au jus, and proceeded to tear into it like a starving pitbull might a toddler. "..sh'o good though.."

Spike: "I don't just eat gems, you know." He shrugged, in his Cadet uniform. He was actually a year too young, but equally, his uniform was devoid of any markings or notations of rank.

Smolder: "No kidding." She shrugged a bit. "First time having beef, though - we usually eat ham or birds." She smiled a bit, still a touch shy around all these older, wiser adults - and her boyfriend.

Admiral Labrador: "Well, I'm more than happy to share!" She beamed a grin. "Good food means a happy belly. Happy bellies do better on a long day's work."

K: "You used to work in the Life Guard Service, right?" I nodded to her.

Admiral Labrador: "Yes. Before I transferred to the Navy, I was in charge of a Life Guard Cutter in the north, along the Yukon Shores." She shrugged. "Lots of fisherdogs out there, and we get serious storms, soo.." She trailed off. "..I've had to swim in some pretty cold waters before."

Fluttershy: "You sound like you really care." She stated.

Admiral Labrador: "Oh, yeah. We've had to help seal families, rescue whales trapped in fishing nets, the works. The Canidan Life Guards do a lot of work with animals, too." She nodded, taking a bite of her eggs.

I noted that Canidans did use full untensils. I did half expect them to just eat with their muzzles like dogs did. The few times I've sat down with Havoc, he did, too, but his puppies ate with their mouths only. I surmised they graduated to untensils as they got older, and untensil use wasn't just something he picked up from Meagan and the others.

Around then, her Task Force Commander, Rear Admiral Rex Dober, came in, with his staff. Rex Dober was a traditional black-and-brown Doberman Pinscher, and a cutting figure. You could tell he could fight in a scrap, and I noted he wore a Q-Device, a notation that he attended Petty Officer school, meaning he was raised through the enlisted ranks. He was a bit younger than Misty, though he had a touch of grey in the muzzle.

He was accompanied by the "Destroyer Commodore" (formation leader for the Destroyers and Frigates), Fleet Captain Annie Ashli. She was an Lhasa Apso, but given her dimensions (she was slightly shorter than the five-and-a-half foot tall Rear Admiral Dober), it made her look graceful. Her long locks were carefully styled and trimmed back, giving her a businesslike coat and hairstyle, that ended in a ponytail.

I stood to greet them.

K: "Admiral Dober." I nodded, and offered my hand.

Rex: "Please, Rex, General K." He stuck out his paw and we shook.. strong grip, but not in that 'testing your grip strength' way.

K: "Then, call me K, please." I nodded to him, and offered my hand to Captain Ashli. "Fleet Captain." I nodded.

She accepted my hand, and made a graceful, ladylike bow, gently curtseying just slightly, showing her refinement.

Capt. Ashli: "General K." And she nodded to the others, wagging her tail a bit. "Nice to meet you all!"

Rex: "Lemme fill my feed bowl, and we'll talk turkey, General. I'm eager to hear everything you've got to wag your tongue about." He said, un-admiral-like bellying up to the buffet, and starting to grab this and that with just enough gentlepuply restraint not to be crass. "I've heard a lot about you - I wasn't at the Eyesore Battle, but I've got a little experience. Before the war, I commanded the Sail Frigate Montgomery." He nodded.

K: "Seen some action?" I asked.

Rex: "We fought Griffon Pirates a few times.. couple shore actions to save some hostages here and there, or take it to the pirates in their own beds." He shrugged. "I've been in a few fights." He smirked, finishing piling his plate and tray with food, and sliding over next to Admiral Labrador. "Misty." And nodded to her.

Admiral Labrador: "Rex." She smiled and wagged her tail.

Rex: "MMmm. Been a bit since I got some grub THIS good." He nodded to me. "You know, General.. ever since I came in the room, I felt we could absolutely do this." He nodded to me, talking between swallows of food, then paused, as though he'd just realized something, and looked at Admiral Labrador. "I dunno - Misty?"

Admiral Labrador: "I felt it on the Eyesore Island Battle." She shrugged a bit. "I was very nervous, but once I knew K was in charge, I dunno.. I felt better. And then I met him, and I was instantly.. just.. happy."

Capt. Ashli: "I feel it, too." She blinked puppy eyes at me, and looked at Havoc's troops, who were all a bit clustered towards me. "I think they do, too!"

Havoc: "K's my buddy." He beamed a happy grin, his tail had not stopped wagging.

K: "It's because humans have a very, very deep connection to canids - you were the first creatures we domesticated. You were our first companions, our first friends besides each other. Universal Laws being what they are, I imagine there's.. some universal constant to that, something that extends beyond the veils between dimensions, that reaches each of us, instinctively." I nodded to Applejack and Luna. "Just like how they all see me as an Alpha Stallion.." I looked back at Rex. "..you see me, instinctively, as a friend."

Sgt. O'Fang: "Shure do, pally!" He beamed a grin, himself. "Reminds me, my brodder's gonna name a pup from his next litter after ya! That's thanks fer savin' his first litter!"

As I was finishing up, Prince Blueblood, Vice Admiral Goodenough, and Brigadier Fosberry came in, with THEIR staff officers.

K: "Admiral, Brigadier, Commander Blueblood." I nodded to each of them.

VAdm. Goodenough: "General K!" She bowed her head a bit, then giggled. "It is good to see you."

Brigadier Fosberry: "Indeed it is." She nodded with a grin. "Leg's healed up, and I must say, I'm rather eager for a fight." She and the others hit the buffet.

I went to get up for more coffee, but one of the Attendants beat me to it.

Blueblood: "I'm sure we'll have plenty, Brigadier, ma'am." He nodded to each of us, but cocked a brow at seeing Dusk next to Rarity. Polite prince that he was, he let it go, though.

So, we'd have breakfast together, then plan the invasion. This was going to be.. a chancey proposition at best. The Ambleonians had some experience, the Canids had less, and I wanted to actually do a single practice run before we attacked.

The invasion, after all, was the final major lynchpin of this Campaign.

Part 2: Burning Candles

TIME: 04:52 NCT
DATE: War Day 927/21 Decemus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Approaching Shore north of Palembang, Dutch East Indies


I was with the Marine Raiders. Blinda's personal choices, no less. With me, also, were the girls, Lightning Dust, Steela, Dusk, Golden, and Broken. Norfy, Cosmic, and Gaze were backing me up, and coming ashore with the Canidans. Most of the rest of the CAG was split between here and the over-land operation towards Surabaya.

Blinda: "Shore! Dead ahead! Look alive, Marines!" She shouted.

K: "Having fun yet, Blinda?" I smirked.

Blinda: "You know it, K." She patted my shoulder. "We've been in some tough spots."

K: "We have - and they'll only get tougher." I nodded. "Remember your assignment - clear the coast defenses, and then watch their backs."

Blinda: "No problem." She smirked a bit. "We got this."

Dusk: "I'm sure we do." He nodded and gently peeked a little over the top of the landing craft's front ramp by turning his head to the side and taking full advantage of his skull shape.

Nothing seemed to be interested in us. We hit the shore five minutes ahead of schedule.

As the ramp came down, I was first out, boots in the sand. I started advancing on the short cliffs ahead. No sign of opposition - just as planned.

The Raiders were on shore in short order. As the landing craft hit the beaches and offloaded their cargo, they then pulled back, and swung back out to sea. We had one company of AAV's from the Ambleonians and one from the Canidans. Both were direct copies of the M-17 Edson, so, it didn't much matter.

As those got to shore, we all advanced along the edge of the beach, towards the south, with the AAV's out front, and Marine Infantry close behind.

K: "It's looking good." I nodded, and held out my hand for the radio mic, which was there instantly, thanks to Broken. C> "Alpha Actual to Ares and Hunter."

Seven: C> "Ares Actual, go ahead for both."

K: C> "Split here and make for the POW camp. The C-1 Buffalo are offshore and waiting for your signal." That's how we were going to evacuate the prisoners - by plane.

Seven: C> "Ares Actual, roger."

I could see Havoc's team split off, but the Foxes were in the tall grass before my eyes could track them.

No action, yet. This was good.

Blinda: "K!" She slid over to me. "Scout planes report. Enemy armor heading this way - it's the big stuff. Fleet Air Arm is on it." She nodded to her Exec. "TAKE COVER! MAKE A STAND! DIG IN!" She shouted, as her Exec took off.

Sigmask: "FINALLY! Some action!" He slid into position next to one of the precision fire teams.

I got behind a rock with AJ, Dusk, and Rarity. The rest of the girls spread out a bit.

K: "Heavy Tanks, huh?" I frowned. "Yeah, we're going to need to make sure our next class of Amphibious Assault Ships can land heavy armor ourselves." I shrugged.

Everyone halted the advance, and hastily dug in. We didn't know who was in command any more, but they had the bright idea to hit us with the big stuff as soon as they could.

I couldn't see them, yet, though.

It didn't take long for everyone to have some hasty fighting positions, and anti-tank teams spread out. The AAV's had neither the armor, nor the cannon, to face a Tirek Heavy, so they were at the far flanks.

Overhead, I watched as Fairy Fulmar strike-fighters flew over us, and started lining up for attack runs.

Then, the other shoe dropped.

A very bat-shaped plane flew overhead from the shore-side.. then five more. Enemy Fighters!

K: "Blinda!" I called with concern.

Blinda: "Oh, I see them! I SEE THEM!" She had her radio in hand already. C> "Mike One to Fleet - ENEMY AIRCRAFT SPOTTED! We need more planes!"

AJ: "Them's some odd lookin' planes, hun." She was looking through binoculars. "Very odd!"

K: "Those propellers are huge.. it's definitely a heavier-than-air aircraft.. must be some kind of turbo prop." I shook my head.

I lifted up and looked out to sea-side. HMAS Howe, HMAS Wellington, RCS York, RCS Fire River, and RCS Glencoe were cutting close to shore, fast, and would be the first NEIGHTO ships to fire at air targets. York and Howe fired at almost the same instant with their 4.7-inch and 5-inch DP guns, followed by Howe's 40mm Vickers guns, as they turned to broadside the enemy planes as best they could.

CFA-1 Firefoxes from RCS Snow Dome were on the scene smartly. The Fighter-Bats were quick, but clumsy, and the CFA-1's got on them right away.

I saw one Fighter-Bat take a shot from RCS Fall River's forward 5-inch battery and detonate. Another one fell to RCS Glencoe's 25mm guns. They were sending more.. the sky was soon quite full. Ohh.. so this was the plan!

K: "They're trying to overwhelm us." I nodded.

Dusk: "Solid tactic." He shrugged a bit. "Problem is, we were prepared for this to happen."

K: "Indeed." I nodded. "Oh, here comes the tanks." I pointed.

Indeed, the Tirek Heavy Tanks were lumbering towards us. Slowly. They did have a speed disadvantage. The original flight of Fulmars dropped low below the airborne melee, and started bomb runs. They had no ground-based AAA other than their on-board machine guns, and they didn't do a very good job. The first line and second line of tanks were simply evaporated by heavy armor piercing bombs.

Above, the Fighter-Bats were being knocked out of the sky by superior piloting, and sea-based AAA fire.

We held.

Behind the heavy tanks, a formation of Duregar APC's started heading our way, with troops pouring out of the back... NOW it was our time to shine!

K: "OPEN FIRE AS SOON AS YOU HAVE CLEAR SHOTS!" I pointed to the heavy machine gun teams. "AREA EFFECT FIRE!"

Obediently, they arced their MG's up and started arcing fire down on the oncomiong enemy troops. They were about 800 meters out. Rarity and Dusk both set themselves up, and almost immediately started picking targets and muttering to each other on confirmations as the enemy grew closer.

The AAV's? Those WERE a match to Tirek's APC's! And they had good range on those guns, so, they started shooting as soon as they could. The enemy APC's started taking damage immediately, and blowing up or stopping, to the 20mm guns of the AAV's.

The enemy started charging at full speed - mainly Duregars, with some Porcine with them, and a cluster of Raptorians. Some Goblins were mixed in there, as suicide bombers. Once they crossed the 500 meter mark? Everyone started shooting. The enemy hit a wall of lead. The Ambleonian Troops had an advantage, since the L7 rifle came with an optic that made 500 meter shots, easy.

Golden: "They're gettin' close!" He called out.

K: "Mortars!" I pointed. "They're in range - hammer them!"

Golden: "AYE!" He keyed the Mic. C> "Alpha to Hammer and Anvil - range, five hundred, give us a curtain!"

Behind us, the Canidan Maritime Brigade and Royal Ambleonian Marines started flinging mortar shells into the air, as the enemy charged at full speed. Besides the wall of lead, they were now getting a cloud of mortar shells, and the angry bees that were shrapnel, cutting them up, tearing chunks from their formations.

I actually saw a Porcine have a mortar shell fall RIGHT into his mouth, and.. well, he detonated into meat chunks. A rather cartoonish thing to happen, some Looney Tunes level shit, only he didn't have a butcher's stand appear over his corpse and signs selling it in sections.

Three hundred meters. Now everyone was shooting. The enemy was picking positions and leapfrogging. Except the Porcine, they were now returning fire from their Pershings. We were getting some fire from the shore side, but that was being handled by gunfire from the ships.

Our side was taking some hits, now. I could hear it. Calls for Medics. Our positions were excellent, but that did not 100% ensure safety. I was picking shots myself, now, too. Carefully aimed shots at whatever I could.

The mortar fire tapered off as the enemy got closer - too close for the Mortars. What had started as a massive tsunami was reduced to a handful of the enemy here and there, but attacking in careful waves. Someone still had tactical control.

Dusk: "Rarity! Behind that APC!" He barked.

Rarity: "I see him. K?"

K: "GET HIM!" I encouraged. "AJ, Broken, cover!" I tapped Golden. "Come on!" And moved to plug a small gap opening to our right.

I didn't see what happened, but AJ, Broken, Dusk, and Rarity moved off the plain and on to the beach to do this, about 20 meters to our left.

Golden: "Think they're spent, yet!?" He asked, as he drilled a Duregar at 40 meters, and reloaded as I covered him.

K: "Close!" I settled in to a machine gun position, as Golden and I moved the body of the gunner out of the way. "Feed me!"

He moved to the ammo cans and pulled a belt, getting it in place as I racked the bolt on the Beaver Machine Gun. I cut loose, using one arm to brace the stock, and slinging it back and forth on its bipod. As the Beaver was just an Abrams with a finger trigger, this was no problem for me. Short, controlled bursts.

I caught sight of the APC that Dusk had indicated, and watched bodies fall, left and right, from an angle none of us could get at. One Goblin with a red uniform coat and lots of medals, followed by a proper Porcina, were running away. Both were cut down at the same instant.

Dusk: C> "We got their brain trust! Coming back, but we need a medic!"

K: C> "Roger!" I pressed the mic key on my headset. "Golden, go meet them with a Medic - get Fluttershy!"

Golden: "Aye!" He scooted off.

As the enemy realized they had no control, they started to simply attack without reason. I was alone in this fox hole, and I emptied the last belt in the ammo can, before switching back to my rifle. Short, controlled bursts. Reload, close bolt, short controlled bursts.

Silence.

Brigadier Fosberry: C> "ALL CALLSIGNS, CEASE FIRE! WE GOT THEM!"

I was panting.. out of breath. The last Duregar had dropped dead at the end of my barrel, and at my last round. I pulled myself out, and went to collect my team.

[End of Part 2]


Part 3: Jungle Climb

TIME: 05:47 NCT
DATE: War Day 927/21 Decemus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Dog One Beach, 12km N of Palembang, Dutch East Indies


We'd cleared out most of the outer defenses. They had decided to attack the beach landing area and try to throw us off our beach head.

Brigadier Fosberry: "..your instincts were correct, General." She nodded, smiling. "Landing us at the further beach, forced them into a disadvantage. If we'd tried to hit the beach they were defending, it would have been a slaughter."

Col. Trumpeter: "Canidan Forces sustained 51 killed, 77 injured." He reported, as he himself was getting bandaged up.

Colonel of Marines Asgill: "Ambleonian forces sustained 56 killed, 62 wounded." He nodded. "And for once, did not include the Brigadier." And smirked.

Brigadier Fosberry: "Charles!" She hissed playfully at him.

Blinda: "We took 12 dead and 18 wounded, K." She shrugged. "Ochre's hurt, too, but not badly. Dusk is fine."

K: "Alright." I nodded, and patted her shoulder, casually petting Colonel Trumpeter behind the ears. "Adora, Tankette, you two have command here. I'm taking my team and heading for the jungle. Once Hunter and Ares have cleared their objectives, have them advance half way and stand by. And get me a Buffalo if you can, I want an escape route if I need it."

Blinda: "You'll have it." She nodded.

K: "Alright. Catch you all later." I nodded, and headed off. I had everyone but Dusk, Rarity, and Fluttershy with me. Over at the medical area, they were seeing to him. "Dusk?"

Dusk: "Nothing serious." He shrugged. "Come on."

K: "Cody?" I looked over to him.

Dr. Allcome: "He'll be fine. Nothing serious at all - I've seen worse bumps from foals playing ram-head." He smirked. "Be with you in a moment." He said, packing up.

Twilight: "It's been a bit since I was out in the field." She sighed.

Spike: "We'll be fine, Mom." He beamed a grin.

K: "No kidding." I nodded.

So, the team coming with me was.. Twilight, Sunset, AJ, Rose, Toola Roola, Fluttershy, RD, Gilda, Rarity, Spike, Dusk, Golden, Broken, and Dr. Allcome.

The mountains were a.. LONG distance away. About.. 300 kilometers. We'd be taking two M-15 Nash Half-Tracks the whole way, and a supply drop was scheduled for the way back. It wasn't possible to sail around the other side of the island safely, with Tirek's forces still running around, and my first plan - a paradrop - was off, now that we knew he had fighter aircraft.

So, over-land it was! We calculated a trip of 8-10 hours.


TIME: 11:36 NCT
LOCATION: 182km E of Palembang, Dutch East Indies

Travel had been MUCH slower than we thought it would be. MUCH slower. We thought we would have covered about 240km by now. We'd barely covered 170. The main problem - and something fixed by the Ditch Roller at the front of the vehicle - was bad terrain. Worse than we thought.

The terrain undulated in careful waves. We were going against those waves. After spending three hours driving between two larger ones, and not finding a real exit, we'd had to climb some terrain the half-tracks weren't rated to do, but we managed to do anyway.

K: C> "HOLD UP! Hold up." I shrugged. "Place looks pretty flat here." I looked up. "GILDA! DASH! COME ON DOWN!"

Applejack: "Mm.. ah'll break out th' vittles." She shrugged.

K: "Yeah, let's break for lunch." I shrugged. "Hell of a trip." I climbed out from the turret of the Half-Track, and slid down to the cab. "Dusk? How's the fuel?"

Dusk: "Lower than it should be." He nodded. "We better empty the Jerry Cans."

We did have extra fuel aboard, just in case. Seems that was a good idea!

K: "Yeah, good idea." I nodded. "Sunset, Rose, give me a hand - we're going to fuel up from the Jerry Cans."

Sunset: "Sounds good, Kay." She slid out from the other vehicle - she DID know how to drive! "Come on, Rose."

Rose: "SURE!" She hopped out with a smile. "Woooww..! Look at all the NATURE!"

Fluttershy: "..yes!" She slid out from the back of the second APC, and immediately went to investigate. "I'll see if I can find some friends."

K: "Fluttershy, for you, that's easy." I shrugged. "Just smile."

Gilda: "No kidding." She shrugged. "I still f-"

Fluttershy: "I forgave you long ago." She hugged Gilda. "Besides, you're married to my best friend."

Gilda: "I kinda am, huh?" She smiled, broadly.

Rainbow Dash: "SPEAKING of relationships.." She nudged Twilight. "What's with you and Flash, Twi?" She smirked.

Twilight: "Oh, I-" She started to just naturally open up, then froze, and blushed. "-'m working.. on it.. heh."

K: "Hmm.. Jerry Can." I grabbed one and went over to the gas cap on the first Half-Track.. this was not my kind of conversation - this was Girl Gossip.

Each Jerry Can held 20l of fluid, or about 5.3 gallons. These things had 61 gallon, or 230L tanks. The outside racks held 6 cans, or just over half a tank.

Applejack: "WERKIN' on it?" She leaned in. "Whut'z'at mean?"

Twilight: "Oh, you know.. we've.. gone to some functions together.. he was my body guard while I was touring the states.." She shrugged her draconic wings. "..trying to set up that government that K wants.."

Applejack: "M-hm." She raised back, and half shut her eyelids. "Spike? W'how'y'all feel about 'im?"

Spike: "..I think he'd make a good Dad.." Spike was blushing. "..and I caught them kissing!"

Rainbow Dash: "AHAHHA! I knew it!" She ribbed Gilda.

Gilda: "Oh, yeah. You're hard up for him." She beamed a grin.

Twilight: "C-Come on, girls, really!?" She was blushing. "It's not like I'm constantly.. thinking about him or anything!"

Rose: "Oh, come on, Twi." She leaned in. "I remember what you're like TOO well! You'd never admit your feelings over something like this!" She smiled a bit. "Toola? I think we need to throw a Victory Party when we're done here! A good party should get you two fully together." And blinked. "And I don't mean drunk, either."

Sunset: "She has a bad history with consciousness-altering substances." She shrugged. "Luna told me about it when I asked about Spike."

Toola Roola: "Oh, for sure! A party it is! I'll work on the party banner while we're on the mission." She smiled and strutted. "Get some streamers.. some balloons.."

It struck me that Pinkie.. pulled a Spock. For those of you unfamiliar with the reference, at the end of Star Trek II, Spock knowingly sacrificed his life to save his USS Enterprise, but before he did, he transferred a duplication of his consciousness into Dr. Leonard McCoy, a long time friend of his. Later on, Spock knew he'd somehow be resurrected, and his mind would need to be re-transferred into his new body.

Pinkie Pie did something similar. With Toola Roola. She passed along her party passion, her Pinkie Sense, and more, to her protege. Knowing one day she'd have to leave. And that her clones still existed in the world. That they might yearn for this, but not know how to do it.

Toola would teach them.

This had been Pinkie's plan for the last.. almost three years.

Smart pink floofter!

Dr. Allcome: "Lunch is ready, ladies." He announced.

Fluttershy: "OH!" She was being carried over by a flight of small birds. "Uhm.. I've.. made some friends." She blushed a bit. "They love my bird seed."

K: "I'll bet they do, Fluttershy, I'll just bet they do." I said, tapping the sixth Jerry Can into the tank.

And smiled.

Even in the middle of war, she was the most positive vibe in the world.

I also caught sight of Golden AND Broken looking at her from different angles.. smiling. Their first real taste of her positivity. I could feel their hearts swell with joy like this, and I knew that somehow, we'd get this done.

It didn't help that I caught Dusk staring at Rarity, either.

K: "Hey, Dusk." I took a seat next to him.

Dusk: "K." He nodded, distractedly, his rifle cradled in his lap.

K: "You have feelings for her." I looked down. "Big ones."

Dusk: "I.." He shook his head slowly, looking away. "..it's more than I coul-"

K: "Make a move." I stated. "I know her very, very well. I admit it, kinda an open secret, we were having a fully approved affair with her. She liked this. She used to blackmail rich and powerful stallions and mares with all kinds of stuff, to get things done. Generosity, remember? She was very generous with the money of people that hoarded it for no other reason than to stare at shiny things." I clapped a hand on his shoulder. "She's a good mare. And she deserves a good stallion - like you."

Dusk: "Ahh.. I'm.. I'm just a.." He struggled, trying to find a way to politely demean himself.

K: "Hero." I stated. "And a good stallion with a good bearing, an honest guy, and a brave one." I looked over to him. "She needs someone like you. Someone that'll be her partner, someone that can touch both sides of the world she now has. I can't be that person. I have Applejack." I leaned in. "YOU deserve her. And she deserves you."

Dusk: "S-Sir.." He blinked. "..ehh.." He tried to excuse himself, verbally, tried to make some kind of an excuse. "..maybe you're right?"

K: "I know I am. She.. kinda asked permission already. I told her that our arrangement was never a claim, it was just some fun we both had. I have a feeling she's looking for something, too, but.." I shook my head. "..she's not going to make the first move."

Dusk: "I believe you're right." He nodded. "I'll.. see.. about this after the operation. After we win, here." He nodded, staring straight ahead, with determination. "Is it wrong that I felt this way from the moment I saw her?"

K: "Not at all, man. Not at all." I nodded, with a smile.

Lunch was Ration Oats and some dried fruits in there, with tea and condensed milk. A simple meal, but a good and hearty one. It felt great, though, because we were eating together.

Even in war, there was time for friendship.

We were off, after that. Off towards the unknown, with only Dusk's memories of this area to guide us. But, it felt okay. We could overcome any challenge, as we had each other. Old friends, new friends.. just friends.

Part 4: Light at the Top of the Moutnain

TIME: 18:37 NCT
DATE: War Day 927/21 Decemus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Perilous Peaks, 297km NW of Palembang, Dutch East Indies

Keep in mind, if you look at a "real" map, the East Indies are mirrored left-to-right, okay?

Anyway, we were finally at the mountains, having passed by a smaller city that was clearly still occupied by Tirek forces. Our mechanized troops would be on the way in a few hours, so, we didn't bother to do more than stop, take some observations, and radio those back.

We were finally here. In the mountains. Where the Kirin were.

K: "Alright, dismount, everyone." I said, getting out of the back, and handing off Twilight's Abrams to her. "Dusk? Rundown."

Dusk: "It happened.. before the war. My last trip here with my father." He shrugged. "It was after I'd retired. I mean, I didn't have anything else to do.." He cleared his throat. "..anyway, that town back there, Surulangun, is a key town for the silk trade. When I was a younger stallion, when we stayed over, over there, I'd sneak into the mountains. Met a few Kirin, but I kept it to myself when I was asked." He shrugged. "Anyway, when I was on that last trip, I went to see my Kirin friends and.. everything had changed. They were all silent. They could not speak. One of them that I kinda knew, Autumn Blaze, she looked so.. frustrated.. sh-"

He was suddenly pounced from the bushes by an unseen assailant!

Autumn: "HOLY CRACKERS, IT'S DUSK!"

Everyone was stunned, with weapons half raised at her.

Dusk: "At ease!" He commanded us. "She's the one I was talking about!" He looked up at her. "Can you let me up, please?"

Autumn: "OH! OH SURE! Oh, gosh, buddy, oh, I'm so sorry!" She hauled him up with her Kirin horn magic, and dusted him off, then took a look at each one of us. "HI! I'm Autumn Blaze. And boy, am I glad to see some people I can talk to!" She zoomed over to me. "So you MUST be the Human of Legend!" She felt me up, with Applejack giving her a SEVERE stink-eye from the side. "Woooow! I really didn't expect you'd look so human. But, then agian, I've never seen a human before, either, so, I'm not too sure what that would look like!" She slid between me and my Grant, and relieved me of it (I didn't try to resist - the safety was on). "So, this is one of those Rifle things, right?! I've seen Tirek's troops carry these. But-but, not like THESE, I mean.." She swung it around a little (though I noted she WAS careful about where she pointed it). "Looks deadly, alright!" She tossed it back to me, and zoomed over to Fluttershy. "Hiiii!"

Fluttershy: "Oh, my!" She smiled. "Hello! I'm Fluttershy!" She nodded to me. "That's K, and.." She lolled her head a little. "..his wife, Applejack."

Autumn: "OH!" She blushed immediately. "Oh, I'm so sorry, babe! I didn't mean to make it look like I was putting the moves on your stallion like that." She trotted over and bowed her head very quickly. "Sorry! It's.. I.. it's just been SO LONG since I've been able to TALK to someone that can talk BACK, and I have.." She stared breathlessly at me. "..so much I need and want to say."

K: "It's okay." I shrugged. "Ahh. Which way to your place? We can talk, there."

Autumn: "OH! Oh, right, right.. uhm.." She pointed. "..up there."

Dusk: "I thought you lived next to Village Square, by the Vase Merchant?" He cocked a brow.

Autumn: "I.. uhm.. kinda.. was.. exiled.. from.. my village.. for.. talking." She frowned.

K: "Care to tell us about how that happened?" I asked as we made our way up the side of the hill, and to the grounds of her home. "Ah.." I saw the painted things with the fake faces.. oh, extreme lonliness for an extrovert. She was probably on the verge of madness. "..I mean."

Autumn: *Sorrowfully* "It's.. a long story."

Applejack: "You'd rather.. not talk about it?" She tilted her head.

Behind me, I didn't see it, but both Toola and Rose were grinning like loons. Webley later told me that, all the way to Surabaya, she felt a TWINGE.. a strong TWINGE.. like... she knew what happened.

Autumn: *Defeatedly* "No.."

Applejack: "I-I under-"

Autumn: "I'D RATHER SIIIIING!"

Toola Roola pulled me down as Autumn began singing.

Toola: "Let. It. Happen."

K: "Roger."

("A Kirin Tale" - Copyright, 2018, Hasbro. Edits by Dreamlander.)

Autumn (Singing):

"La, la-la-la, la-la

La-la-la, la-la-la

The Kirin used to speak and sing,

We weren't always quiet.

We told stories and funny jokes,

My stand-up was a riot!


But then one day, a fight broke out,

And hurtful words were said.

Flaring tempers were inflamed,

Destruction quickly spread!


And flaming bred from head to head

It even burnt our... bread!"

She popped up next to me with a loaf of burnt sourdough and showed it off.

Autumn (Speaking): "Sorry, I forgot how much I love rhyming. Where was I? Oh, right!"

(Resumes singing)

My happy village lay in ruins,

Relationships got worse.

Spoiler alert: we quickly learned,

That words could be a curse.


"No more talking," yelled our leader!

The last thing said aloud.

Into the Stream of Silence,

We stepped as a crowd.


The water cooled emotions,

And peace was soon restored.

But with no way to speak my thoughts

I got super... bored!"

She slid up next to Broken Dawn and pulled out a hand-crafted pad of papers with boxes on the sheets.

Autumn (Speaking): "Seriously, there's only so long that Sudoku can keep you entertained! I mean.. I even invented it!"

(Resumes singing)
"'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky,

Unless you let it rain!

And shiny apples sometimes come with worms!

No, you can't give up your laughter,

'Cause you're scared of a little pain.

It's a lesson that the Kirin never learned!


I was stuck in silent prison,

With the voices in my head.

'Til I tripped over my salvation,

In a helpful flowerbed.


I found a cure to clear my pipes,

And I became quite chatty!

With years and years of stored-up words,

I drove my village batty!


They didn't like my jokes and songs,

And daily dose of news,

The plays I wrote, the speeches spoke,

Variety revues!"

Autumn (Speaking): "Or the story about the Kirin who hid below an opera stage, And fell in love with this opera singer, and he wore a freaky half-mask thing, and he played the organ a lot and got all broody 'cause the singer was in love with another dude, so he took her away on this underground gondola. I mean, who doesn't love musical theater?!"

Dusk: "That's Phantomhorse of the Opera, and I took you to see it!"

Autumn: "OH! RIGHT! Anyway..!"

(Resumes singing)

"The village leader made it clear,

I had to make my choice.

I could stay and live with them,

Or I could keep my voice.


So I came here, but left the couch alone,

They're hard to move!

With just the view for company!

Until ya heard me groove!

Take it away, boys!"


Golden & Broken (Singing): "Oh, rainbows won't light up the sky,

Unless you let it rain!

And shiny apples sometimes come with worms!

No, you can't give up your laughter,

'Cause you're scared of a little pain.

It's a lesson that the Kirin never learned!"


Autumn (Singing):

"'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky,

Unless you let it rain!

And candles just won't glow until they're burned!

No, you can't give up your laughter,

'Cause you're scared of a little pain!

It's a lesson that my village never learned!

No matter how hard I schooled them,

Fear of hurt is still what ruled them,

Sometimes you gotta let it raaaaaaaain!

Yeah, sometimes you've gotta let it rain..!"


She ended the song posing on her hind legs, forelegs outstretched towards the horizon.

I was seated on a rock, now, watching this. Toola Roola and Rose were both nodding.

Toola: "See? It was important!" She smiled.

Golden: "Aye.. mate.. did we really just do that?" He blinked, and looked at Broken.

Broken: "Aye, ah think we did..!" He sat down and looked puzzled at himself.

K: "Universal Law of this world - it is possible to spontaneously break out into song. Had I known, I would have brought Vinyl and Dex Runner." I shrugged. "Or Octavia."

Twilight: "No kidding. She could've put down a good beat." She smiled a bit. "And why do you have your phone out, K?"

K: "Oh, nothing, I just recorded the whole thing." I smirked at Golden and Broken.

Golden: "AW! Maate! Me reputation!" He blushed a bit.

Broken: "Er.. that's.. going to stay between us, right, sir?" He blinked a bit.

Fluttershy: "Actually, I think you both have amazing voices!" She smiled at them. "You should sing more."

They both blushed.

No matter what, my friends were still ponies.

Dusk: "So.. that's what happened. I'm sorry, Autumn." He shrugged. "How long has it been?"

Autumn: "How long?" She moved over to Dusk and got up on her hind legs, grabbing his uniform. "NINE. YEARS." And shook him a bit.

K: "Good lord.." I blinked. "..how are the foals handling it?"

Autumn: "T-" She suddenly curled up into herself. "There aren't any foals." She said, utterly heartbroken. "They all grew up. No one.. made.. any more.." She started softly crying. "WE CAN'T COMMUNICATE!" She wailed. "And without THAT we can't find LOVE, we can't SHOW LOVE..!"

Fluttershy came over to her, and cuddled her. So did Rainbow Dash.

Rainbow Dash: "Man.. this sucks. K! We gotta DO something!" She looked over at me. "Come on, dude! I-I m.." She looked down a second. "..you.. you're the reason I fell in love, dude. You're the reason I started talking about my feelings. Honestly. Not.. not.. lying about them or bottling them up." She looked up at Gilda. "I.. mean.. without you.. I wouldn't have a family." She looked back at me. "We gotta help!"

K: "We do." I said, rising. "And we will." I nodded. "We'll figure out something."

Twilight: "Well.. what are we going to do!?" She shrugged.

K: "I'll think of something. I always do." I nodded.

Sunset: "Kay always has a plan." She smiled.

Autumn: "Oh?" She looked up, at Sunset. "You call him Kay, and everyone else says K?"

Twilight: "I didn't hear a difference.." She blinked.

Autumn: "Well, I mean, K and Kay.. she.. says.. more of it?" She cocked a brow. "I'm-I'm sorry, that's probably the loneliness talking."

K: "Nah, there's a slight difference." I shrugged. "I can hear it sometimes, too." And I looked at her. "Mind if we make you something to eat?" I asked.

Autumn: "OH! S-Sure.. I.. don't cook much.. never could cook very well. Heh-heh. Ah.. be nice to have something besides burnt field mouse and raw fruit for a change." And looked at her burnt bread. "And burnt bread."

K: "Doc?" I nodded to Cody.

Dr. Allcome: "Of course, K." He nodded with a small smile.

I helped him, Broken, Dusk, Golden, and Gilda haul stuff from the Half-Tracks, setting down a bag of coal as well.

K: "Off chance. Ever had this, before?" I held out a piece of it.. very pure anthracite coal, and a second lump, one of common field-issued charcoal.

Autumn: "COAL!?" She zoomed over.. and.. with a heavy blush, gently nibbled them both, then chomped into the Anthracite like an apple. "You.. probably.. don't know this.. but.. Coal is.." She shrugged a little, nervously. "..it's a very big flirt in our culture."

K: "I don't mean it as such." I said, softly.

Applejack: "He don't." She was a bit stern, and cocked a brow at Autumn.

Autumn: "I-I.. didn't think so.." She ate the other piece as well. "It's very tasty." And smiled. "I mean, we also exchange coal on a special holiday that's coming up soon. Only if you've been good!" She nodded rapidly. "And only between family or very, very close friends."

K: "I'd like to be friends." I said, still soft, but I went back to a normal tone with.. "JUST friends."

Autumn: "Of course!" She nodded rapidly.

K: "So, just asking, this will at least get people to see we're not a threat, right?" I nodded to the coal.

Autumn: "Sure would!" She nodded, and raised her head, smiling.

K: "Great. We have an ice breaker. Let's have some dinner, then see what we can think up." I nodded and gestured.

So, we had another problem to handle. We didn't NOT expect this.. we knew this Kirin-Nirik thing existed, we just didn't know HOW it was a problem. Now that we did, I understood why we'd have the sense of urgency over this. Kirin being able to burn down a village in a rage? Yeah, that'll be.. we couldn't let Tirek control these ponies.

And I'd make sure of that. AND help them with their problem.

No matter what.

Part 5: Kirin's Tail

TIME: 08:08 NCT
DATE: War Day 928/22 Decemus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Kirin Village, Perilous Peaks, 297km NW of Palembang, Dutch East Indies


Morning in the peaceful village. We rolled up to the outskirts in our Nash Half-Tracks and left them there. We also tookt he step of not carrying our rifles. But, I left Rose and Dr. Allcome back there to watch them, just in case.

I could see the Kirin pacing around.

K: "HEY!" I called out, to get their attention.. and believe me, I had it.

Dusk was right next to me.

I held out coal in my palm to the nearest Kirin.. she looked up at me, not quite understanding why I'd make such an offer.

K: "I'm K. The Human of Legend." I nodded to her. "Please accept this offer of friendship."

She blinked at me, and opened her mouth, as though to speak on instinct.. and stopped. Unable to.

What none of them knew was, I already had sent Twilight and Fluttershy out very early this morning, trying to find those plants that Autumn had spoken of - Fluttershy had been taking full advantage of her ability to communicate with the animals in nature.

The Kirin I'd been addressing, whom I didn't know was named Cinder Glow, blushed a bit, and accepted the coal in her mouth, gingerly. Then held up a hoof to tell me to wait, and ran off.

The rest of them looked at me, curiously, and I just opened the coal bag.

K: "For ALL of you!" I announced. "I want to be your friends." I flapped my arms.

A few of them did come over and accept the offer of coal. They didn't EAT it, but they accepted my tokens.

After a bit, their Queen approached.

K: "I'm told you are Queen Rain Shine." I bowed respectfully, and held up a chunk of Anthracite. "Please accept my humble offering of friendship, on behalf of the Kingdom of Eqeustria."

She blinked, sniffed the coal, and then accepted it gingerly. Blushing, slightly, even. I knew from Autumn that this quality of gift was.. a bit more than just "I want to be your friend." Right now, I was going to use all the charms I had, to get through to them.

K: "My name is K." I said in softer tones. "Some call me a General, some call me father, some call me friend. I am friend to all who accept my friendship." I nodded to her. "I know the pain of your people. And I'm here to offer an alternative."

She looked at me quizzically, then recognized Dusk, and nodded to him, with a small frown.

Dusk: "I didn't know the truth until Autumn explained it." He shrugged.

K: "Your Highness, two things. One, look at your people. Where.. where are the foals? Where's the LOVE!?" I paced around a bit, flapping my arms. "Where is the love your people have for each other? With you not being able to speak, those expressions of LOVE are LOST forever!" I twirled around a bit. "There's.. no children here. No happiness."

Queen Shine gave me a small glare - I got the point. What about the pain?

K: "Yes, okay, when you get angry, you transform into Nirik, and you want to absolutely kill each other. I get it. That's a problem. That's why we have things like anger management classes and psychological counseling." I shrugged. "Anger happens. It's a natural emotion. So is love." I gestured around. "You can't have a rainbow without a little rain. And without your emotions, your race will soon be extinct." I shook my head. "You.. DO.. see that, do you not?"

Queen shine bowed her head, looking around, and looking at the depressed or blank stares of her people. She blinked several times, as though reality had just hit her. That she had.. doomed her people. Tears started to gently form.

K: "Think about it. The happy laughter of foals running around. I have foals, too." I moved right over to her and pulled out my phone, showing her my family picture. "Those.. those are mine. Me and my wife." I pulled Applejack closer. "I love them so much. I'm willing to die for them." I gently pulled Rain's  muzzle to look at me. "And there's someone out there that wants to USE you and USE your Kirin to destroy it."

Queen Shine looked right into my eyes with fear. She knew who I meant.

K: "He's here." I nodded.

From the side, I heard something clear it's throat. Something I knew all too well.

Tirek: "HOW RIGHT YOU ARE!"

Everyone turned to face him.

He was standing there with a full Brigade of troops, right at the edge of town. Moreover, he was in the lead.

K: "Your Majesty!" I pulled her to face me. "That coal is impregnated with the cure to the River of Silence. PLEASE!" I almost embraced her. "If we don't stop him.. he's going to use that power you fear so much to slaughter MILLIONS OF INNOCENT LIVES."

She gave me a determined look, then SWALLOWED the Anthracite coal chunk whole.

Queen Rain Shine: "DARK EMPEROR TIREK!" She turned and bellowed. "Mere steps behind the Human of Legend, aren't you!?"

Tirek: "Oh, my..! Found your VOICE finally, have you!?" He bellow-laughed.

Golden (To Broken): "Mate.. I think we might be in over our heads.."

Broken (To Golden): "Take the rifle.. I think you're right.. holy Celestia, by Luna's m-moon..!" He passed a rifle to Golden, accepted from Dr. Allcome.

Queen Rain Shine: "YOU BET I HAVE!" She sneered at him, then addressed her subjects. "KIRIN! I haven't time to say why or explain anything, but I ask you, accept my mistake! We were wrong. I was wrong. We must channel our anger, not fear it. Accept the Coal the Human of Legend has brought us!" And nodded. "We must defend what we have rebuilt.. using that anger.. that power.. or we will be enslaved by the Dark Emperor to forever use The Power of the Nirik to destroy, to kill, to HARM! THE VERY THING WE FEARED!"

They didn't take long to get the message, and start gobbling up coal like candy before foals.

Tirek: "Ohh.. it matters not. I will either enslave you, or DESTROY YOU!" He pointed his Trident at me. "What say you, Human!? You've lost TWICE to me so far! Care to make it a three-streak!?" He cracked his neck by twisting his head to the side a couple times. "I'm game."

I drew the Sword of Rainbow's Light.. and pointed it at him.. stepping before everyone.

K: "Oh, yeah.." I nodded. "..even if I die here to protect them, I won't let you. I won't let you enslave them, kill them, harm them. You've hurt and killed enough." I shook my head. "No more."

Tirek: "I will gut you like a fish, and twist a second of your chosen pony mates around my Trident." He smirked. "You.. didn't think I didn't see the same things, did you?"

K: "Oh, we thought so." I nodded.

Applejack: "Y'ain't'a'gonna git me." She sneered.

Tirek: "I will tear you in half and dip apples in your juices.. then consume your family whole." He taunted AJ.

K: "I'm gonna fuckin' kill you." I growled.

Tirek: "THEN HAVE AT YOU!" He announced.

Queen Rain Shine: "QUICK! Human!" She slid UNDER me and made me mount her! "I will help you!" She raised her head, and her horn glowed. "Sword of Rainbow's Light.. accept the Light of the Nirik!"

The sword glowed in my hands.. and transformed into a VERY hefty, long, burning LANCE!

Soo.. this is what it was meant by the sword gaining power. I gave it a look, and then looked at Tirek with a grin.

Game on.
