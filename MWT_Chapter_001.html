Chapter 1: Redemption of an Old Man

Part 1: One Again Returned

TIME: 17:32 NERST
DATE: Redemption Day 1/7 Septimus, 2054 C.S.
LOCATION: Forest near Princesston

K: "So. We better camp here for the night." I shrugged.

Sunny: "Yeah." She nodded. "Uhm.. I have oats!" She smiled.

K: "Mm..." I smiled a bit. "..I kinda miss Ration Oats." I shrugged. "So plain, but so filling." I nodded to her. "It's like a hug in the stomach from Celestia herself, letting you know, it'll all be okay." I stared into the fire as she started getting water on to boil. "I can't recall how many times I came upon soldiers just having.. sharing.. oats and whatever they could toss in there.." I blinked, letting the memories come. "..Rapid Bearing. He was from Ariezona. Good stallion." I nodded. "He liked a little cream in his." I shrugged a tiny bit. "Dusty Dunes." I smiled. "I loved her. She.. she liked anything in there. Turkey Jerky was a favorite." I looked to the side. "My home is beyond the dead zone."

Sunny: "Yeah." She smiled a bit, and nuzzled up under my left arm. "But, I'm here, General. You've got me."

K: "Just K." I nodded. "Just like the old days. I'm not General or Sir, I'm just K."

Sunny: "You got it, K!" She nodded firmly.. then looked at the buttons on her satchel, gently tracing them with her hoof. "What were they like? The Elements?"

K: "Fluttershy. Friend to all animals. Wife of Golden Wattle. She'd been.." I shrugged a bit. "..the war hurt her in ways I never thought was possible to recover from, but she did." I nodded. "Rarity Seeker. Wife of Dusk Seeker, who ended the war as Commander of Luna's Guard. She designed our uniforms.." I nodded to her collar. "..and those rank pins." I beamed a grin. "Pinkie Pie. First Element of Laughter. Always ready for..." I trailed off. "...I have to see if I can find The Magic Mirror... if it's not broken.. I might be able to get her back. We need her." I nodded. "Rainbow Dash-Buran. Wife of Gilda Buran. Daughter-in-law to the Prime Minister of the Griffon Kingdom. Fastest pony alive. Always there to cheer you on and make your day brighter." I smiled. "Twilight Sentry - nee Sparkle. First Element of Magic. So consumed by science and its ideals that she often forgot the Equestrian element. Until the war opened her eyes, and her heart. Her husband, Flash, was the Commander of the Solar Guard."

Sunny: "They.. all sound so amazing." She sat in awe, and took the oats off the fire.

K: "The.." I screwed my eyes shut. "..one I miss most of all.." I swallowed hard. "Applejack. My.. my wife.." I let the tears come. "She's gone, too." I just stopped.. and sat in silence for a bit as I was handed oats in a bowl. "I lost my human wife, too. And the rest of my family." I looked at Sunny. "Now, more than ever, I am ready to die to save all of you." I shook my head. "I wish Broken Dawn was here. He.. he knew about all this." I gave a dismissive wave and ate.

Sunny: "No matter what!" She nodded firmly. "You have me. As I said. K." She smiled a bit. "The future needs you. We need you." She tilted her head off to the side a bit. "Maybe I do, too. You're the answer to so much."

K: "Answer. And I'm the one with the questions." I shook my head. "Who is there in the government?" I nodded to her.

Sunny: "Well, we have a partial Parliament - the Parliament in Exile. They use the old State Capital building in Providence, Rowed Island. Then there's Prime Minister Haven." She shook her head. "She's.. she goes between the towns with her daughters, and tries to do what she can."

K: "Who are her daughters?" I shrugged.

Sunny: "Well, her one daughter, Pipp, is really famous." She pulled out her cell phone again, and showed me a video by her. It reminded me of a YouTuber "Idol" Format - said Talent does a thing in each episode, and the episode is opened and closed in a specific, ritualistic way. "I've never met them in person."

K: "We will." I nodded.

Sunny: "I'm just so fascinated by you." She smiled a bit. "I mean, there's stories about you and the War against Tirek, but.. some people were thinking you weren't quite real. Like, you were some kind of narrative allegory for a collection of other ponies, or something." She gestured a bit.

K: "No, I'm real, and I'm me." I shrugged a bit, smiling at her. "I'd almost forgotten how cute you ponies are."

Sunny: "OH!" She blushed. "K! Really. W-We've just met."

K: "Have we? It sounds like you know me pretty well already." I nodded to her. "I'm the one at a disadvantage, here."

Sunny: "..well, yes.." She blushed harder. "..I've thought about this moment for years." She looked down, embarrassed. "But, I keep wondering, do I really deserve it?"

K: "I think you do." I nodded, smiling.

Sunny got up and came over to me, and slid into my lap. A big part of her was playing out some fantasy she'd had for many years, something that probably occupied her thoughts for a very long time, and something she'd imagined over and over again. And I just gave her clearance to go ahead with it.

Sunny: "K.. I.." She looked up into my eyes, and I could see a sparkle there..

K: "..maybe later, I'll ah.. get you something nice. Take you out to eat.." I let my fingers run through her mane.

I had to admit, it'd been a long time since I felt like this.

Sunny: "Mmmm.." She grinned, and her eyes briefly crossed as I skritched her ears just right. "..love some apple pie.."

K: "Oh?" I smirked. "Anything else?" I said, in low, soft tones.

Sunny: "Mmmmmm... candy apple.. apple fritters.. apple dumplings.."

I froze.

K: "What.. ah.. what's your full name, Sunny?" I cocked a brow.

Sunny: "Sunrise Magic Starscout." She smiled, rubbing into my hand. "My dad said.. our line goes back over ten generations.."

K: "Ah." I blinked. "Sunrise Magic.. is.. a breed.. of apple." I blinked.

OH SHIT.

OHHHHHH SHIIIIIIIIT.

FUCKFUCFUCKUFKCUFJCKJFKJSDKLF...

I shot up out of her grasp and her off my lap and zipped up as fast as I could. I was so un-erect, I swear the boys retreated inside!

Sunny: "W-What's the matter?!" She was shocked, having been rolled on her flank.

K: "YOU'RE MY GRAND-DAUGHTER!" I pointed at her. "I don't CARE if it's been TEN generations - you're MY KID!" I shook my head rapidly. "Ooohhh... oh, no, that's incest!" I pointed at her.

Sunny: "INCEST?!" She looked very hurt and offended at first, then sat down, and started thinking.. hard.. tapping the side of her jaw, and then finally shaking her head. "Wow.. I.. I guess it is, huh!?" She looked at her hooves. "Wow. I.. I almost made a big mistake." She looked very sad, about then. "That.. I'm sorry."

I sat next to her and put my arm over her shoulder.

K: "Look, Sunny. You.. your mom and dad have passed, right? Well, instead of your lover, if.. you wanna call me Grandpa.." I one-arm hugged her. "..I couldn't be prouder to have a grand daughter like you."

Sunny: "OH!" She launched herself into my arms, and hugged me. "I'll TAKE it! I'll TAKE it! Family!? I'll take it." And cried a little. "Family.. grandpa."

K: "Grand-daughter." I hugged her back.

So, I had arrived in the world, met a pony, and.. well, almost made a mistake. But, now, I had a.. I had family. No matter how bad this future was, I had family, now, and that was enough. It would always be enough.

Part 2: New Friend

TIME: 06:52 NERST
DATE: Redemption Day 2/8 Septimus, 2054 C.S.
LOCATION: Forest near Princesston

Izzy: "HI, NEW FRIEND!" She popped into my view as I slowly woke up.

K: "Hi, new friend." I just smiled, and reached up, and rubbed her neck. "I'm K. Who're you?"

Sunny: "Mmmh? What?" She popped an eye open, and realized there was a unicorn about ten inches from her snout, given that she was laying close to me. "AAAH! Whoa!" She slid out of her covers, and skidded back.

Izzy: "I'm IZZY!" She giggled. "Izzy Moonbow!"

K: "I'm K. But.. you knew that already, didn't you?" I smiled, and slid up to a seated position. "Sunny, why don't you make our guest some tea? And breakfast." I nodded to her.

Sunny: "Ah-we-uh-sure." She stammered a bit, before the calmness in my voice soothed her. "So, you're a Unicorn! I've never really gotten to talk to a Unicorn before. I've got so many questions.. why are you here?"

Izzy: "This!" She held out a faded piece of paper, with drawings on it, as Sunny started to get the fire built up from embers, again.

Sunny: "Ah, I'm Sunny Starscout.. oh!" She took the paper, and looked at it. "Izzy.. I DREW THIS!" She smiled. "When I was just a Filly!"

Izzy: "Yeah?!" She hopped around a bit. "Then that means we've been friends all our lives!!"

K: "Good way to look at it." I nodded, and got my boots on. "So, what.. was that paper the whole reason you came out here?"

Izzy: "KIiiiiinda?" She tilted her head. "I've never been out of Bridlewood before." She blinked and looked down. "Not a lot of ponies leave. Some do, but.." She shrugged a bit sadly. "..lots of them feel like just Unicorns should live there.."

K: "Don't be sad." I leaned over and hugged her neck - she smelled of flowers, glue, and a soldering iron all at once. "You know who I am, right?"

Izzy: "YEAH!" She leaned into the hug. "The stories were right! You hug good!" She threw her legs over me, and gave me a full body hug. "But.. that means.. if you're here..." She pulled back.

K: "I'm going to do everything I can to fix everything here." I nodded. "I promise."

Izzy: "It's.." She blinked, tilted her head at me, nodded like I'd understand what she was about to say, and continued. "..it's Jinxies to talk about you too much, except on certain days. Like, most unicorns think talking about you too much or at the wrong times could jinx us - that you won't come back, or you come back and it's bad, bad."

K: "Well, I'm here. For better or worse." I groaned as I stretched - I'd slept in a bad position.

Izzy: "Aww.. aren't you supposed to be.. like.. a super Ponidonis or something?" She poked her nose at my ancient middle aged body.

K: "I'm 44, Izzy. Humans peak at about 35. I'm past my prime." I shrugged. "Not saying I can't get back into the shape I was, but it'll take time and effort." I nodded. "Just like making friends." I pat her snout. "That's a cool charm bracelet." I nodded to it. "Not many ponies back in the past wore stuff like that."

Izzy: "OH!" She held it up and waved it in my face a bit. "I have.. like.. I like to make these for friends." She reached into her own saddle bag, leaned over and put one on Sunny. "Here.. I made this for you." She smiled at her as Sunny made tea.

Sunny: "I have.. so many questions." She smiled. "None of the other unicorns I've ever met ever want to talk about themselves."

K: "And that right there is part of the problem." I nodded. "Do you two know the story of the Winter of Hard Feelings?" I looked at them.

They both shook their heads 'no' - Izzy with more energy, Sunny with more reverence.

K: "Yeah, I need to.. tell you your own history." I nodded, and shrugged. "Ironic - a human that has to teach ponies about pony history." I gestured as Sunny handed me a canteen cup with Red Tea.

Izzy: "Oooo! Red Fireleaf Tea?!" She accepted the cup gingerly. "I usually like a smoothie in the morning."

K: "Oh, really?" I smirked.

Sunny: "I loooove making smoothies!" She cheered up. "I have a smoothie machine back home." She tilted her head. "I wonder.."

K: "You should have a side gig. I can't imagine being a conspiracy theorist and a Militia officer pays all the bills with extra." I nodded.

Sunny: "Well, I do okay.. but.. yeah." She smiled. "Great idea, grandpa!"

Izzy: "GRANDPAAAAAA?" She got excited again.

K: "She's descended from my daughter Liberty Apple." I nodded, smiling, as we sipped the tea, waiting for the ration oats to soak.

Izzy: "OH MY HOOFNESS!" She bounced again. "Oh, wow, Sunny! That's sooooo amazing!"

Sunny: "Yeah.." She said, wistfully. "..I wish you'd met my dad, Argyle. He was even more obsessed with you than I was."

K: "Where ever he is, looking down on us now, I'm positive he's happy and knows that you'll be well looked after - both as family, and as a General." I patted her neck.

Sunny: "I guess he is!" She smiled.

Izzy: "So.. what are YOU TWO doing out here?" She piped up.

K: "I just got here last night. Sunny says that Bridlewood is closer to here than Maretime Bay, and I should head there to meet with people." I shrugged.

Izzy: "OH! Yeah! It's about a day's trot from here. Maybe a bit more? I dunno - everyone says I trot fast!" She giggled.

K: "I can see why." I smiled a bit. "You have a lot of energy." And shrugged. "Given my condition, I'll probably slow things down to another over night out here in the woods."

Izzy: "Oooo... that's dangerous." She blinked. "There's lots of nasty things out here!"

K: "We're well armed." I nodded. "You carrying?"

Izzy: "Yup!" She pulled out a Roc and a large knife. "Gotta stay safe out here."

K: "We'll be okay, then." I nodded, reassuringly.

Izzy: "..ah.." She grew calm. "..not against the Darklies." And looked away.

K: "Explain." I remained calm, myself.

Izzy: "The shadow creature things made by The Deep Darkness. They can eat us. Worse.. uhm.. bullets don't hurt them much." She shrugged a bit.

K: "I see." I nodded. "And as Sunny explained, you've all gone a thousand years with no magic."

Izzy: "..yah." She shrugged a bit, then went over to a tree. "BUT! I can do THIS!" She essentially started jackhammering her horn into the tree, and cut through it no problem.

When she came back over, I made a point to gesture to her to come closer so I could touch it. It felt.. more.. solid. Like a crystal.

K: "Do you feel that, at all?" I said, stroking it gently.

Izzy: "Nah. I mean, like, I know you're touching it, but I don't, like feel anything from it." She blinked. "Should I?"

K: "Evolution works fast, here." I nodded a bit. "Unicorn horns used to be VERY sensitive. I don't even think this is keratin any more. It feels like crystal." I looked at them both. "Keratin is basically what hoofy nails are made from. Unicorn horns used to be made of that, with a very thin membrane under the outer surface that was VERY sensitive to touch." I looked at Izzy. "Do unicorns still 'kiss' by rubbing horns together?"

Izzy turned BRIGHT RED and slunk back a bit.

K: "Yeah, that's.. not a normal kiss any longer." I shrugged. "My apologies. I'm working with thousand-year-old cultural standards."

Izzy: "I thought so, so.. I didn't say anything." She smiled a bit, though.

Sunny: "I know you just came from there, and everything, but we need to get to Bridlewood." She shrugged. "K needs to meet everypony there, and.." She looked at me. "..ponies need to know he's back."

Izzy: "Okay!" She bounced a bit. "No problem. I know the best way there." She smiled. "Howeverrrrrrr.." She rubbed her fetlock on her chin a moment. "..there might be an easier way, if we take the OTHER way..."

Sunny: "Other way?" She tilted her head.

Izzy: "Yeah." She nodded excitedly. "Once we're done with breakfast.." She started eating quickly.

Sunny: "I usually make pancakes at home.." She smiled a bit.

K: "Been a minute since I had a good pancake." I nodded. "I look forwards to it."

Izzy: "Ooooo.. real earth pony pancakes." She thought about it in amazement.

K: "One thing at a time." I nodded, grinning. "You're so full of energy." I pet her mane again, and she leaned into it. "Oh, you like mane pets, huh?"

Izzy: "Feels good.." She said, smiling, relaxed a bit. "..I knew it would, too."

Sunny: "My Grandpa." She slid over and got up under my other hand.

K: "Good thing I have two of these." I smiled and scratched them both.

After finishing breakfast, we gathered everything up, and started heading towards Bridlewood. It was a pretty peaceful trip, and Sunny and Izzy spent the time talking to each other about what Terran or Earth Ponies did, versus Unicorns. I absorbed this information, and found that Unicorns had fallen heavily into superstition over the last thousand years. I didn't quite catch everything she was saying, as I was huffing and puffing like a chain smoker after less than a mile, though I kept up with them as best I could.

I was, indeed, slowing them down. I knew it. But, it was inevitable. I was old, I was out of shape, and I'd need to get back into shape if I was going to be able to do this again. I knew I needed my old stuff back - my magical items. All of them.

My pace was slowed by age. Instead of being able to push myself to a 25+ mile day, averaging 10 hours of marching at an average speed of 2.5 miles an hour, I was barely getting 1.5 miles an hour. The girls were strolling along, and I was solidly marching.

Sunny: "You okay, Grandpa?" She dropped back.

K: "Just not used to this, that's all." I shrugged. "Been a while since I did this."

Izzy: "It'll be okay." She slid back as well.

K: "Sorry I didn't come as a super man, out of the box, girls." I shrugged.

Sunny: "Oh, Grandpa!" She giggled.


TIME: 09:37 NERST
LOCATION: Ashokan Lake, Erie, New Equestria


K: "Hey, Ashokan Lake.." I smiled.

I walked to the edge of the lake, and I was about to stick my hand in the water, when I pulled back, just ahead of Izzy trying to grab my arm with her mouth.

K: "..bad idea?" I asked, looking at her.

Izzy: "Bad idea." She nodded.

Sunny: "What was it like a thousand years ago?" She smiled, tilting her head at me.

K: "Not dangerous." I shrugged. "What's in there?" I asked Izzy.

Izzy: "Dark things." She shrugged, saying that dismissively. "But, we can get across the lake on a boat." She nodded firmly.

K: "DO we have a boat?" I tilted my head at them.

Sunny: "Not pre-made, but if we use my shelter half and some other materials, I think we can make a canoe." She shrugged.

Izzy: "OH! I know EXACTLY what to do!" She tugged at Sunny. "Empty out your pack! Leave this to me!" She tapped her hooves on the ground, excitedly.

I did likewise, and let her take the lead. I knew these ponies well enough to know that, when one declares themself an expert, you best listen. I was reminded immediately of Rapid Bearing.. and I missed him badly.

Over the next hour, Izzy patched together a workable boat from the items in our packs, and some lumber she harvested from the surrounding forest. As she did this, I talked to Sunny at length for more details of what I missed. She didn't have a lot of solid answers, as it WAS a thousand years ago - and she pointed out something that was pointed out to me in the Great War: How much do I know about what happened a thousand years before me?

Truth is, I didn't know much about 1026AD. So, it stands to reason that only a very few stories from 1026 C.S. would survive until today, right? Right. The general information that the War happened, and "General K" was the hero, and that he MIGHT have been a human, were the main take-aways from that era. That and, a cataclysm happened, Celestia, Luna, Sunset, Cadence, and Twilight vanished. Magic was lost. Theia knows the details, but she doesn't explain them, because she doesn't want ponies to worry about them endlessly, when they can't do anything about them.

Izzy was nothing short of a miracle worker. With the things in our packs, and some lumber, she had a very solid raft made. And three paddles. The raft even had a small sail and mast, and a rudder.

What got me curious is that she decorated it with some glitter that she had.

K: "Hmmmm." I examined the glitter-touched oars. "..keeps the dark things away, does it?"

Izzy: "Oh, yeah!" She said, smiling. "YOU get it!" She pranced a tiny bit. "I just knew you'd understand. Yeah, glitter adds that extra sparkle to things and it helps keep the dark things.. it wards them off." She seemed very upset that they even existed.

K: "Well, you did a fine job." I nodded, and got on, with Sunny. "I can only imagine how inventive you can be." And smiled.

Izzy: "Awww.." She blushed a bit. "It's just a bit of Unicycling!"

Sunny: "What's.. Unicycling?" She looked over at her new friend.

Izzy: "Taking something old - lots of somethings old sometimes - and making something NEW!" She beamed a grin ten miles wide.

K: "She's MacGuyver." I chuckled, pushing off the shore with my oar.

They both looked at me, confused.

Both: "Who's MacGuyver?"

Oh, boy.. I forgot. I'll have to explain television shows all over again, but, at least now, they'd understand the concept.

Part 3: Sailing Away

TIME: 11:03 NERST
DATE: Redemption Day 2/8 Septimus, 2054 C.S.
LOCATION: Ashokan Lake, Erie, New Equestria


We were making excellent time. The improvised sail was working very well to pull us along. The raft was wide enough that even with a rather brisk wind, we didn't feel unsteady at all. The girls were chatting with each other - Sunny had 142 questions for Izzy, and expressed great remorse that no other Unicorns she'd seen before, wanted to chat about them.

Izzy: "..I mean, I can open a tin can with my horn, and all, but that's kinda messy.." She blushed a bit. "I never thought I'd end up having SUCH a good FRIEND!" She slid over to me. "Here, K." And she put a friendship bracelet on my wrist.

It had a little sun, moon, and heart carved into these clear stones that I could not identify. As I rotated it, I saw an apple, a diamond, a butterfly, a lightning bolt, a paint brush, a balloon, and a star-with-sun as well. I choked up immediately.. and had to sniffle hard.

Izzy: "..are you okay?" She put her hoof on my shoulder.

K: "I have no idea how you knew, but.." I held up my right wrist. "..now I know they'll always watch over me."

Izzy: "You seem like you have soooo many things about you, that just ONE Mark isn't enough!" She smiled.

K: "These were my friends." I nodded to the bracelet. "I have... their memories.. I have to honor. I have to fix whatever went wrong, somehow. You all deserve to live in peace." I shrugged, but my emotions were getting to me.

A thousand years. And I had no idea what exactly had happened. I needed to know. I needed to know the full truth of what was going on, why, and how. And moreover, I needed to know what it was that I was here to stop, prevent, change, or rescue.

We made excellent time the 12+ miles up stream. When we transitioned from lake to stream, the wind was still with us most of the way, but we ended up using oars for the last half of it, moving us over shallower parts of the stream by force. It was still much faster than walking. We arrived at the former site of the town of Shandaken in just a few hours.

TIME: 14:47 NERST
LOCATION: Ruins of Shandaken, Erie, New Equestria

We disembarked from our raft, but made sure to pull it as far on shore as we could, so we could possibly use it later. We didn't know how long the trip to Bridlewood might take us, so, we took the sail (Sunny's shelter half) as well.

Izzy: "She was a good lil' raft, wasn't she?" She beamed a grin.

K: "We got two mares up a stream, so, I think so, Izzy." I shrugged. "I know the route to Bridlewood from here. It's almost a straight shot north, about 12 miles." I nodded. "I think I can make it the whole way." A gesture, dismissive, and a shrug. "Granted, it'll take eight hours. So, we have a choice, ladies. Camp out in the town ruins for the night, and take the extra daylight we have left, to forage, or we march hard and hope to get to Bridlewood about midnight."

Sunny: "I bet when you were in good shape, you could've done that march a lot faster." She nodded.

K: "I got to the point where I was doing about three and a half miles an hour." I paused. "You know, I noticed you didn't correct me on Miles to Country Miles to Kilometers."

Sunny: "Well.. we kinda use both the old system and the new one." She shrugged. "Military tends to use kilometers and meters and centimeters and such, but a lot of civilians started using the country mile to measure distance, and just shortened it back down to mile." She shrugged with one hoof upturned.

K: "Goodness me." I chuckled.

Izzy: "Hoofness." She corrected, gently.

K: "Hoofness." I smirked. "For you. I haven't any hooves. But, I do have these." I leaned over and gave her ear skritchies.. she hummed pleasantly.

Sunny: "I think we should rest, Grandpa." She nodded. "You're right, you're not in shape any more. And the last thing we need is you out of condition in the woods with a monster coming around." She looked at Izzy. "I don't think we could protect you by ourselves, with two pistols."

K: "Good point. I presume a nice big fire will keep the nasties away..?" I led on, as we marched into the town ruins.

Sunny: "You're right, Grandpa." She smiled. "I'm.. I'm still getting used to that. Grandpa." She thumped her head to my hip. "My Grandpa."

K: "You'll never be alone again, Sunny." I nodded. "I promise. At least not until my job here is finished, whatever it is."

We got to the center of town, and I realized that while it was indeed abandoned, it had not been abandoned for more than perhaps a hundred years. There were signs of struggle, too - some bullet holes in a few walls. The town courthouse was surprisingly in very good condition, so we decided to shelter there. The large glass dome over the entrance hall was long shattered by weather, and the natural depression in the middle that led to a now-dead tree made a perfect camp site.

K: "I have a good knife for batonning wood, but I'd prefer an axe." I shrugged. "I guess you didn't plan on large fires, did you?"

Sunny: "Just a cooking fire each night - easy enough to gather up enough wood for that." She shrugged.

Izzy: "An axe.." She paced off.

K: "Something's up." I nodded. "Come on, let's gather what we can and get the fire started. I have a feeling we'll have an axe to clear the large logs, soon."

Sunny: "Well, I can gather the wood." She shrugged. "You know the good plants to eat, right? That really hasn't changed. Why don't you forage, Grandpa?" She smiled. "You need to get back in practice, too."

K: "Natural leader, ain'cha." I smirked. "I'd say that's my genes, but I know who's those are - Forest Spirit." I nodded. "Alright, I'll be back."

So, I went off into the town. I had never been to this town during the war, but I had heard about it from somewhere. I wandered a bit, keeping my AR-15 in low ready. I had 450 rounds with me, and my current tactical rig held six magazines. That should be plenty. As I checked a few buildings, I re familiarized myself with transitioning to my pistol. The old ways.. I had to remember, I had to get this back down pat.

I needed my soldier's instincts sharpened again.

After about half an hour, I found a town community garden, long over grown. But, it bore fruit - literally. Equus-native fruits that I'd long missed. Large, fat Blueberries were mixed in with Colmaberries, an apple-sized berry that tasted like a blackberry crossed with a Granny Smith apple.

Granny Smith.. did you have to live to see the end? I missed her immediately, thinking about her. I put my hand to the ground.

K: "Granny, if you can hear me wherever you are, I love you still. Grandson to Grandma. I'll do everything I can for our family, I promise." I patted the soil, then went about picking the fruits.

After I gathered those, I went and grabbed some huge potatoes, and carrots. As for meat.. well.. I'd have to get inventive. Fluttershy wasn't around to offend, so, I kept watch for deer or hog. What I spotted was a Quozat - a hog-like member of the rodent family, native to Equus. They had a reputation for waiting garbage, but in the wild, they feasted on tubers and roots, along with a side diet of insects. One round from my AR-15 put it down with ease.

I trucked all this back to City Hall, and found Izzy had, indeed, constructed a scrap axe from debris, and was cutting the logs. The axe head looked like a ground down fire axe head, and the haft was a long stick, somewhat hastily formed into an axe handle.

K: "I see you've been busy." I nodded, setting the food down, and getting my knife out.

Izzy: "Yeah!" She nodded. "I heard a shot.." She saw the Quozat. "Ah.." She blinked. "..right, right, you need meat, don't you?"

K: "Very good, yes, I need meat." I nodded to her, as I started to carve up the fat, 8-lbs hog-rat-thing.

This Quozat was fat indeed, and female, so, no gamey flavor. It was preparing itself for cubs, but mating season wasn't quite yet, so, it was full of well marbled meat. I'd scored good.

K: "Sunny, cook the shank portion with some salt and herbs. I'll carve as much of the meat into strips as I can, and smoke it hastily with the fire, overnight. It'll keep good, and makes good stew." I looked at them both. "I'm guessing you two don't eat much meat, if any?"

Izzy: "Fuuuny you should ask that!" She smiled. "Unicorns do, but only certain animals and certain times of the year and certain meals." She shrugged. "It's not very common."

Sunny: "Earth ponies actually eat a lot of meat." She nodded. "At least one meal a day has meat in it." She shrugged. "We have to - without magic, we need the extra protein for muscle."

K: "Makes sense!" I nodded.

Well, I was now on my way. Tomorrow, we'd get to Bridlewood, probably about sun down. Given my slower pace, that is. I'd need eight hours of marching to get there. Figure four after breakfast, then four after lunch, we'd be there about five in the afternoon. A good start, even if I was foraging in a possible danger zone, and backed up by two under-armed mares. They knew the land. That's all I needed.

Part 4: Bridle Path

TIME: 09:07 NERST
DATE: Redemption Day 3/9 Septimus, 2054 C.S.
LOCATION: Former State Route 28, Erie, New Equestria

I marched. The feast that evening had been grand - a stew made with some of the Quozat meat, the potatoes, carrots, and a few things from the girls' kits. Breakfast had been Ration Oats mixed heavily with the berries I'd gathered, and tea. Well rounded, but very military. The girls had both slept almost on top of me all night, and even though they were new to me, the FEELING of having a little pony next to you, curled up to you, gave my battered soul solace for the first time in years.

We were hiking up what used to be State Route 28. It was.. there were very tiny bits of pavement left after all this time, but the trail was well worn. The Everfree Forest had reclaimed much, and grown, over the last thousand years, but it was still the same. I had a sense that The Spirits of the Everfree just KNEW I was back, and knew it was ME. The permanent, ever watching, omnipresence of the Forest that it was.

I was making decent time for me. About 1.5 miles an hour on average. Again, horribly out of shape, but I was still doing it. Izzy was very energetic, constantly looking at everything, and commenting on different plants that were 'new' to me, and strange to Sunny, who'd never once been out this far.

K: "I can feel them, you know." I said, suddenly.

Izzy: "Who? What? Huh?" She stopped mid-sentence, and looked at me.

K: "The spirits. Of Everfree Forest. It's grown." I held my hand out and touched a tree. "I can feel them." I smiled. "Magic may be gone, but.. something.. something is still here." I shrugged. "I was in this world for many years, remember? I got to know this place." I nodded.

Sunny: "Can.. you.. are they saying something you can understand?" She tilted her head, as we stopped.

K: "Not really. Just a feeling." I smiled. "The world knows I'm back." I nodded, grinning widely. "It's a start." I gestured to the path. "Let's keep going."

We walked and talked. I told them of my life on Earth, mainly. How in the last ten years, I'd lost everything of value to me. That I had no one, and nothing. I had no reason at all to return to Earth, and I may as well die here, for all it's worth. Though, I pointed out, I would rather that death be of old age.

K: "Break time." I called, finding a flat rock to sit on, and getting my canteen out. "Good thing we're almost there." I jiggled it, and it was about a quarter from empty. I downed it. "Man, I wonder what kinds of foods I can get when I get there." I smiled.

Sunny: "Yeah." She gave me her canteen, which was nearly full. "Here. I know you're going through a lot of sweat. Take a salt tablet." She handed me one from her IFAK.

K: "Good idea." I downed it, and drank most of her canteen. "Man, I am really, really out of shape." I sighed. "One thing. Y'all ever heard of anyone smoking?"

They both looked at me like that made no sense.

Izzy: "And I dooooon't think he means smoldering and smoking from being burned up or something." She said, inadvertently completing Sunny's thought, which made her smile.

These two were already best of friends, I could tell. Ponies. Fast friendships that last forever. It didn't take much, it never did.

K: "I mean, taking a dried plant - tobacco, a relative of the tomato in a way - rolling it in paper, lighting it, and inhaling the smoke, to get a hit of nicotine, an addictive chemical." I nodded, giving the basics.

Sunny: "No, never." She shrugged.

K: "Humans do that. A lot." I shrugged back. "Back on Earth, I was a very heavy smoker, but the last time I came here, the world was so calming, I didn't feel like I needed it." I gestured.

Izzy: "What about now?" She asked, pacing up, and looking just slightly concerned.

K: "I need a cigarette." I frowned. "This world feels so... so off to me, without that magic. Now that I've been here a couple days, I can feel the difference."

Izzy: "Stand up, and do as I do." She instructed.

I trusted her.

Izzy: "Jinxie, Jinxie, go away! Jinxie, Jinxie, never stay! Fly away, fly away, do not bother me today!" She spun around once, tapped her snootle three times, and bowed her head to the dirt.

I copied her exactly.. well, as close as I could. Surprisingly enough, I did feel that.. that urge pass. Not completely, but enough to where I could ignore it again.

K: "Amazing." I smirked. "Maybe some of those superstitions and dances you mentioned, aren't so silly." I shrugged.

Izzy: "It.. it kept us alive.. after we lost our magic." She frowned.

Sunny suddenly backed up, from the bushes, and had her Roc pistol out.

Sunny: "GRANDPA!" She pointed at three oozing things, sliding out of the bushes. Formless, terrifying, and very eager to.. eat us?

K: "HOLY HAY BALES!" I cursed, profaned, in the Pony fashion (showing how I was slowly starting to re-adapt to the world).

Sunny: "What IS that thing!?" She leapt back, landing on a rock.

Izzy: "Those're.. that's..! THE SHADOW CREATURES!" She pointed with her hoof. "We.. we have to get out of here! We can't fight them!"

K: "Why!" I stated, not asked, as the large one lumbered towards me.

Izzy: "We can't kill them without ma-ma-m-m-magic!" She stammered.

K: "We'll just see about that." I was not ready for this fight, but a fight I would have.

I was over weight again, out of shape, but my instincts.. my instincts were awakening. I had different weapons, but they were my weapons. I knew them. I whipped out the imitation M-9 Bayonet and stuck it to the end of the AR-15. Time to get personal.

Sunny: "K! What do you want us to do?!" She pulled back further, drawing her 2011.

K: "Fall back! Bridlewood isn't far, right?!" I looked at Izzy.

Izzy: "Y-Yeah!?" She blinked.

K: "GET THE MILITIA!" I ordered.

Izzy: "Okay!" She tugged at Sunny's mane with her teeth, and galloped off.

It was just them and me. Part of me was saying to myself, that if I couldn't best them - or at least hold them at bay - I didn't deserve any accolade afforded me.

Fortunately, I was remembering everything everyone taught me. I may not have the Sword of Rainbow's Light, but I had SOMETHING.

K: "Come on, Ink Boy! Let's see how much blood's in ya!" I tactical crab-walked forwards, firing my AR-15 as fast as I could. Stock trigger, it's not the fastest or the best, but I knew it. I could see ripple impacts all over the larger monster, and those ripples did produce a foul fluid of inky blackness.

The two smaller ones charged forwards. I whipped downwards, holding the forward pistol grip like the grip of a Tonfa. I was surprised that when my bayonet blade met the small, murky creature, it bled. Badly. I hit it in the "head" area, and when I pulled my blade back, it fell dead, absorbed back into the ground.

It's compatriot seemed to quit the field, and retreated.

The larger one remained.

I pulled back, pulling out my sharpie, and quickly drawing a sigil into the blade. Sunny said the magic was gone.. I wasn't so sure.

K: "Power of Wind.." I murmured to myself, as I focused my spirit.

It'd been too long since I'd done this, I could feel the drain as my soul connected to the planet and imbued the sigil with energy. I staggered. Bad move. I tripped as I went to dodge the energy beam the creature fired from its mouth, and barely avoided it with my own clumsiness.

I stood up, and fired the rest of the magazine into the creature, then charged into it, impacting it at its midsection. The sigil activated, and the (VERY WEAK) wind spell cut a slice through the monster.

However, my agility failed me with age, and it blasted me away with a short energy wave. I fell back, the AR-15 still embedded in the monster. I scrambled backwards as it morphed a wicked looking scimitar-like blade from its arm, and swung on me.

I rolled left, it swung to the dirt. It reeled back, and I swung right, and it hit the dirt again. I fumbled for my Browning.

????: "HEY, MONSTER! LEAVE HIM ALONE!"

I heard what I can only describe as a hyper burst from a rifle, and the creature was impacted, around the shoulder. The AR-15 fell away, but out of my reach.

A large sandy stallion with a Sheriff's rank badge on his chest galloped up with a strange rifle slung forwards and another across his back. He hefted that one in one hoof.

Sheriff: "HERE, GENERAL!" He tossed it to me.

I rose up, hand up, and caught it around the middle. I noted immediately it had a Gavin-like grenade launcher attached.

K: "IN YOUR DEBT, SIR!" I whipped it around, still seated, and pulled the rifle's trigger.

Hyper Burst indeed. Five rounds at ~2400 rounds per minute. I couldn't feel a conventional striker, and no brass was ejected. CASELESS ELECTRICALLY PRIMED AMMO! The recoil was significant and almost pushed me over.

The creature jiggled as the rounds impacted.

Sheriff: "GET CLEAR AND HIT IT WITH THE GREANDE!" He instructed.

K: "RIGHT!" I scrambled to my feet again, and scooted back to about 15 meters. We both aimed at it at the same time, and fired the grenades.

They impacted, and immediately started fires - Phosphorous grenades! FIRE! And ANY fire around here would have a magical element to it!

The creature roared, and the Sheriff whipped his left foreleg forwards, snapping open the launcher. I copied his movements, finding the launcher's closing latch in the same place as the ancient Gavin. The tube popped to the side, and the Sheriff had two shells in his mouth. He snapped his neck forwards to load his shell, and whipped his head to the side, tossing me the other one. I caught it, loaded it, and we snapped the launchers shut.

The creature regained itself, and started staggering towards us.

We leveled our weapons at it, and fired. His shell was loaded with some kind of corrosive fluid - mine was loaded with liquid nitrogen. It froze chunks of the monster as it exploded, while the corrosive consumed it from the inside, out.

It fell over, and burst apart.

I fell backwards on my ass, my chest burning with adrenaline, and my muscles ached. I was in no shape for this.

The Stallion smiled, nodded, and pulled out his canteen, offering it to me.

Hitch: "Sheriff Hitch Trailblazer. It's an honor to meet you, General K." He smirked. "Sunny was right about you. And I'm real happy to see I was dead wrong."

I took the canteen, and nodded, as the Bridlewood Militia and stationed Royal Army unit charged up, and took position.

TIME: 17:00 NERST
DATE: Redemption Day 3/9 Septimus, 2054 C.S.
LOCATION: Former State Route 28, lower outskirts of Bridlewood, Erie, New Equestria

Myself and this mysterious Stallion had just engaged a Darklie, as Izzy had called it. A shadow creature. What i felt from it was the darkest depth of nothingness that I had ever felt before. Nothing compared. And just as it ended, two platoons of troops arrived, led by a very large, beefy Stallion wearing the rank pins of a Brigadier General.

Brigadier General: "What's going on here?!" He looked around, then at us, with Hitch having the most shit eating grin on his face. He even struck a pose.

Hitch: "Oh, nothing. Just that the Maretime Bay Gendarmes did it again." He floofed his mane.

K: "You had help." I smirked, taking a drink, and forcing myself to stand.

Hitch: "Oh, yeah. General K." He flourished a bow to me.

Alphabittle: "G-GENERAL K!?" He looked at me, nodded, and saluted. "Brigadier General Alphabittle Blossomforth. Commander, 1st Royal Army Division." He huffed a bit at Hitch. "I'm honored to meet the Human of Legend."

Izzy: "We got 'em!" She pranced forwards in a Militia jacket, hefting a rifle. "Betcha didn't think I was in the militia, didja?!" She bounced a bit.

Sunny: "I'm glad you're safe. HITCH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!" She paced forwards, impatiently, at Hitch.

Hitch: "Sunny, you're AWOL. I told them it must be some kind of mistake.. but.. I was sent to bring you back." He dropped all pretense immediately, and paced over to her. "Sunny, you could be in real trouble this time-"

K: "Lieutenant Starscout is with me, Sheriff. And any AWOL charges will be countermanded by General Order 15. If it's still in effect?" I tilted my head.

Hitch: "Yeah, yeah.. but.. you're saying you retroactively ordered her to be here?" He looked confused.

K: "Exactly. And I think my daughter will back me up on that." I nodded.

Alphabittle: "Mm." He nodded, then stepped forwards. "I can't believe you're actually here." He.. it took him a second, but he came over to me and actually lowered himself to the ground. "You wouldn't know by my name, but.." He looked away a bit.

I reached out and put my hand to his muzzle. I could feel it. Sword or no sword, I had spent so much time here before, I could feel things. I felt something from him. Something familiar.

K: "..Dusk Seeker?" I blinked.

Alphabittle: "Y-Yes." He nodded, slowly. "My ancestor."

K: "Making you a distant relation to Princess Theia." I nodded.

Alphabittle: "That's.. not the important part." He cleared his throat, and pulled a small item from his shirt pocket - Dusk and Rarity's wedding bands, linked together on a chain. "If it weren't for you, I wouldn't even be alive."

He was having a very hard time containing his emotions in front of his troops.

K: "I get it." I nodded. "I can hope that you and I will become as close of friends as Dusk and I once were." I leaned forwards, and hugged him around the neck. "Because Friendship.. is magic."

I didn't realize I'd kinda just said a curse word.

Every one of the Unicorns present looked very uncomfortable, and almost quivered in place. Like, they wanted to do something,  but couldn't or felt they shouldn't.

Alphabittle: "We.. unicorns.. don't use that word, General. It's.. we consider it a jinxed word." He cleared his throat.

K: "It came from my mouth." I stated. "And any word that comes from my mouth is a word of salvation, NOT curse!" I pointed at them all. "Now, you listen to me and listen good. Izzy has filled me in on a LOT of things in the last two days. I know.. the Magic of Friendship is losing its.. its warmth, and its bonds that tie you ALL together. YOU PONIES are SOCIAL creatures, and FRIENDSHIP is so vital to your very existence, that.." I shook my head. "..I knew someone that almost went mad without it." I nodded to them. "I'm here. Yes, I'm not the same powerful man I once was in physique and mystique. But that doesn't matter. It was FRIENDSHIP.. it was YOU.. that won against the darkness one thousand years ago - NOT me. I'm just ONE human, all I did was give you the tools, and suicidally threw myself at danger." I shook my head. "I had a role to play in OUR salvation from The Dark King Tirek. But I could not have done it alone. I'm BACK, and THAT means, for better or for worse, the TERRIBLE things that have happened to US all over the last THOUSAND years, WILL be undone." I paced in front of them. "But I can't do it without you. Me? I'm a sign that healing and salvation are at hand. But I am no miracle by myself. I. NEED.. YOU!" Shatneresque. Gesturing. "And part of that means, a lot of the customs and superstitions you have had the last thousand years? You need to be ready to DROP them. Not all of them, not all of them - I am not naiive enough to think that all of them are silly and useless, on the contrary, I'm smart enough to know that some of them are right on target. I've seen it." I pointed at each of them. "But, the FEAR stops here. WE will UNITE.. ALL of us.. and WE WILL overcome all of this. TOGETHER." I raised both hands up and out to them. "What say you? WHO AMONG YOU WANTS TO CAST OFF THESE JINXIES FOREVER, AND STAND BESIDE ME AS WE DID IN THE OLD DAYS, AND STOP THIS DARKNESS!?"

They all cheered.. all of them. I had rallied them. They looked to me for answers. I didn't have them, yet, but I did have a start.

After my speech, I was led by the platoons into the town of Bridlewood. I noted that this town had few buildings that weren't somehow fashioned out of living trees, or festooned in nature. There were SOME, but not many. And moreover, there were crystals on the ground, EVERYWHERE.. which I thought immediately strange, but I hadn't the materials to examine them.

Alphabittle: "Welcome to Bridlewood, General K." He gestured around. "Oh, as I said, I'm commander of the 1st Division, of the Royal Army." He shrugged. "My area commander is Major General Flower, sir, but she's mostly retired-"

K: "Flower.. as in Moon Flower?" I tilted my head at him.

Alphabittle: "Y-Yes, but.." He paused a moment.

K: "Where is she?!" I turned to face him.

Alphabittle: "I-I mean.." He gestured to a house we were passing.

Keeping in mind, all the Unicorns in town were staring at me - like they were seeing a ghost. The few Pegasi and Earth Ponies that lived around here were.. also kinda staring.

I ran up to the house, quickly brushing my hair up, and brushing off my clothes.

K: "MOOOOONIEEEEEE!" I yelled out. "IT'S UNCLE K!"

Elder Flower: "Who's that?" She came to the door, and her wrinkly old eyes just went WIDE. "OH, THERE'S ONLY ONE CREATURE LOOKS LIKE THAT! UNCLE K!" She slid her aged forelimbs around my waist.

K: "Moonie." I pat her head. "You... you've gotten old!" I could barely contain my tears.

Elder Flower: "Oh.. my stars.." She sniffled. "Well, come in! Come in! And bring your friends!" She motioned to Sunny and Izzy. "You, too, little Blossomforth!"

K: "Yeah, you, too, LITTLE Blossomforth!" I snickered.

Alphabittle: "Er-uh, yes, ma'am." He nodded, and followed.

Izzy: "Elder Flower is the oldest pony in Bridlewood!" She hopped a bit.

Sunny: "And it seems she knows K.. I mean, Grandpa." She nodded.

Elder Flower - Moon Flower to me - once she got us inside, made some Black Lotus Tea. Another flavor I'd long craved. It was like black currant tea, but with a flowery essence. Impossible to reproduce on Earth.

Elder Flower: "Now, then." She sat. "How have YOU been? Unlike me, you don't look 1,050 years old!"

K: "I went.. back home." I shrugged. "What do you remember?"

Elder Flower: "Oh, Uncle.. it's been so long.." She sighed. "You know I was just a young lady back then. I can tell you.. Auntie Moon Dancer... she went to Canterlot once she knew what was going on." She shrugged. "I mustered out with the Ponyville Militia." She nodded. "I was 4th Squad Commander, you know." She smiled a bit. "After it all happened, Canterlot.." She lowered her head. "..it was engulfed in darkness. The order came down from command - evacuate towards Manehattan. Dark monsters, dark lightning, black storms, they hit our convoy.. we lost so many. Finally, I ended up with a group of other unicorns, including Spark Seeker and Amethyst Star." She smiled. "Sparky was such a bright lad. Just like his father." She nodded. "We wound up here, with Uncle Vigilance of all ponies!" She smiled, though. "He was hurt badly.. his wives.." She lowered her head.

K: "Oh, no.. Co-Colgate.." I teared up.

Elder Flower: "..they died for Equestria, Uncle.." Her ancient voice turned bitter. "The darkness." She shook her wizened head.

K: "God.. damn it.. Colgate.." I put my face in my hands. "She'd been there since the very first battle. She.. she was one of my original soldiers.." I let the tears come.

Elder Flower: "She was also sixty three, K!" She chuckled a bit. "Some of us do age normally, you know." She had a twinkle in her eye.

K: "Heh, not to me, she wasn't." I shrugged.

Izzy: "So!" She slipped up next to me and popped her had up. "How do you know General K!?"

K: "I was there when she was born, Izzy." I nodded. "I saw her as a filly."

Elder Flower: "Mmm, and you.. I can't ever forget." She smiled.

K: "So, what's this business of you being Area Commander?" I tilted my head.

Elder Flower: "Mhm. And Commander of the Army by default." She shrugged. "I'm the senior most Major General, of the three."

K: "Why haven't you been promoted, then?" I shrugged.

Elder Flower: "Because the other two would throw a fit!" She snickered. "Even though, I've got more time-in-rank than most of the army combined." She looked at Alphabittle. "I've known him since he was a fat little foal!"

Alphabittle: "Elder!" He looked embarrassed.

Elder Flower: "I've seen it all, Uncle. Problem is.. after all this time.. you know, it's hard to remember it all." She shrugged a bit.

K: "Yeah, it's estimated that a human brain can store about 150 years of memories - I can imagine Pony Brains are similar." I shrugged, and drank the tea, now that it was cool enough. "And, you know.." I looked at Alphabittle. "..you don't strike me as someone that was EVER little!" I smirked.

Alphabittle: "W-Well.." He fidgeted with his hooves.

K: "I have so much to catch up on, Moonie." I hugged her again.

Elder Flower: "And I will.. tell you everything I can remember." She nodded and hugged back. "Oh, it's so good to see you. I know, now, that when my time comes, this world will be saved." She smiled a bit. "Do it fast enough, I might live to see it!"

K: "I'll try, Moonie." I smiled back, wistfully. "Can you tell me WHAT it was that did this?"

Elder Flower: "I'm not sure what it was called, we just called it The Darkness. It happened so suddenly, too.. I remember that. It was less than three days from the start to.." She looked around her home. "..us ending up here, with those few survivors."

K: "Amazing." I nodded. "I can't believe it was this bad. Do you know ANY thing about the force of Pony magic being sealed?"

Elder Flower: "I don't, I'm sorry. I know.. someone.. said that Twilight had a plan, though." She shrugged. "I'm sorry, Uncle. I'll.. try to remember." She nodded, thoughtfully.

K: "Well, for the time being, I have a town to tour." I shrugged. "You think on it, and write down anything you can remember, no matter how small the detail or how silly it seems."

Elder Flower: "You gotcha, Uncle." She smiled.

K: "I'll be back, Little Moonie." I leaned over and hugged her one more time, before getting up and leaving.

Alphabittle: "I-er.." He cleared his throat. "She is very respected around here. Most foals have been foalsat by her at one time or another. She's told all kinds of stories."

K: "I'm sure she has." I shrugged.

Hitch: "General.." He motioned me over to where he was, off to the side, by a small target range that seemed to be there more for entertainment than military practice.

K: "What's up?" I asked, pacing over. "Oh, and call me K, Sheriff." I nodded to him. "I'm rebuilding my C-A-G - that is, my Command Advisory Group. And you're in it." I shrugged.

Hitch: "Wow! REALLY?!" He beamed a grin. "Well, in that case, let me show you our main weapon. We call it the Manticore." He said, finally showing me the rifle properly.

K: "Good name." I nodded. "Give me the specs."

Hitch: "6x40mm caseless, electrically primed, solid propellant and primer. No metal or plastic to eject. 5.25 gram round, 1,000 meters per second, 2,633 joules at the muzzle. Accurate range? 600 meters with computerized sights. It gets about 2 minute of arc." He nodded. "The hyperburst fires five rounds at 3,000 rounds per minute, or 50 per second, meaning all five rounds exit the barrel within a quarter second. This ensures that all five rounds hit the target at almost the same instant." He held it up and showed me a small slot on the side. "If there's a jam or a bad round, rack the charging handle one quarter of its length, and the round is ejected. As long as there's a round in the feed cylinder, you can't rack the mechanism back all the way unless you press the bolt handle in before you rack it back. Magazines hold 60 rounds. Switch it to normal full automatic, and it can fire as slow as 500 rounds a minute, up to 960 rounds a minute. Rate is adjustable at the armorer level.." He looked at Sunny. "..by adjusting a tappet knob inside the mechanism." He pressed a small button on the top, at the back, popping open the butt pad. "The whole mechanism slides out from here. With a simple field knife, or small screw driver, all the parts can be removed by the individual user and swapped, if something breaks. The barrel can also be quick detached out the front of the weapon, for other lengths." He nodded. "This is just the standard Grenadier and Markspony barrel length. Marksponies get computerized sights. There's a special grenadier computer sight, too, but those.. aren't common. Especially for Gendarmes." He shrugged.

Alphabittle: "That's part of our problem, General." He shrugged. "We have a lot of good things - ON PAPER. But, I'll be darned if we can get half of it." He shrugged. "Never enough money, never enough resources, so, we make do. Some of my Marksponies use standard analog scopes and just make do with that." He nodded. "You should see the Navy." He chortled.

K: "I can scarcely imagine." I shrugged. "Come on, I want to see the rest of the town."

Izzy: "..isn't Bridlewood amazing?!" She pranced as we moved up to a small stream.

Right there in the middle was a huge, ancient turtle. I almost ignored him, until my eye caught the tiny lightning bolt carved on his shell. I stopped, mid-walk.

K: "No." I blinked. "Noooo waayyyy." I pointed. "TANK! TANK!"

The turtle finally heard me, looked up, and his eyes teared up, seeing me.

Hitch: "Tank..?" He looked between me and Tank.. then he smiled, and started tearing up himself. "Ah.. he.. he says.. he missed you."

I slid over into the stream, ignoring the wetness of the water, and hugged his huge shell, patting his ancient, wrinkly head, and gently nuzzled his neck.

K: "You old dog." I smiled, and wiped away my tears. "I'm.. you.. you're all that's left."

Hitch: "He knows." He nodded, sniffling a little.

K: "As.. as soon as I find out where I'm going to live.. I mean.." I shrugged. "..I don't know how long you have."

Hitch: "He.. he said.. you're one to talk, old man!" He chuckled, but.. Hitch could feel the emotion in Tank's voice.. it was making him cry.

K: "Wanna come live with me?" I asked. "I know you were R-D's first, but.."

Hitch: "He says sure. But he expects his shell polished. Like the old days. And he wants a bigger helicopter hat." He smiled, and wiped his eyes.

Izzy: "A helicopter?!" She chirped up, and leaned in. "Oooohohoh.. I know how to make something like that!" She beamed a grin.

K: "You got it, buddy." I said, softly, then gestured to Sunny. "This is Sunny, she's me and AJ's great grand daughter, through Liberty."

Tank smiled at her, and slowly nodded his ancient head. Sunny gently patted his head and smiled.

Sunny: "Well, you're.. welcome to stay at the Brighthouse, Grandpa. You and Tank." She smiled. "That's.. what I call my house."

K: "Sounds wonderful." I smiled.

I stood up, and got myself out of the water... and I realized, then, I had INHERITED Tank, as MY pet.. from one of my best friends.. that I'd have someone to talk to, even if I needed Sheriff Hitch to translate if I wanted an answer I could understand.

The pieces were starting to come together. I had Sunny, Hitch, and Izzy. My grand daughter, her apparent best friend, and her new friend. I had a start, I had a new weapon to arm myself with, and I had something resembling an army that I could command. I could General again, and I had HOPE that these ponies could, one more time, stand against the Darkness, whatever it was, and defeat it.

I'd help as I always had. Now that I had friends. And as I always say, Friendship is Magic.
