Part I: The Curse


Evening in Canterlot..

..Ponyville was gone, now. Six months ago. Shame, really. Only a few ponies survived the vampire spell, and the later Void Vortex Spell that Sweetie-Belle cast with Father Waddle's help. You told Princess Sunbutt everything that happened - and they did find the book of Necromancy that you'd stashed in your stuff. This left Equestria with only one of the six elements of harmony - Applejack survived only because the farm was far enough away from the town that the Vampires didn't seek her and her family out, and they were likewise too far away to get caught in the initial spell's radius. That and they'd all been asleep.

Not your problem. You were only concerned with one thing: Your new job at the Donut Shop.

Oh, that and you were taking responsibility for one of the other survivors of the incident: Scootaloo.

She survived only by pure luck - the vampires that had been after her, went after larger targets first. She hid in a basement, and the Vortex spell couldn't suck her out.

She lost her hero.. you.. well, you didn't have much choice - Celestia insisted, and promised 'child support.' It helped pay the bills, and at least Scootaloo wasn't a hinderance around the house.

Oh, yes, as part of the Child Support, Celestia set you up with a small house near the Donut Shop.

Anyhow, you'd just gotten home from work - and Scootaloo had dinner ready for the two of you. Hey - I did say she was a help.

"Dinner's ready!" Scootaloo said, as she scooted over to you, and helped you get the batter-soaked apron off. "I'll go throw this in the wash.."

You had a seat at the dinner table, without a word. You were exhausted - you'd had to stay late tonight to help clean out the mixer. It was caked (ha-ha) with donut batter.

Chicken and vegetables.. given that beef around here was sentient, it was one of the few meats that you could get. That, and ham.

"Hard day?" She pulled up her chair.

"You have no idea." You shook your head and took a drink of the milk that was set out for you. "You finish your homework?"

"Yup, and cleaned the house." She nodded firmly.

She wasn't so much a burden foisted upon you by a Goddess, as she was a room-mate that happened to be about 12 in human years of development.

"Thanks." You didn't hate her.. but.. ever since that night, you felt.. colder towards everyone.

PTSD? Something like Survivor's Guilt that kept you from properly forging relationships with ponies (not that you were intimate with them before this)?

Dinner complete, you'd help Chikun Pone put up the leftovers and do the dishes. You were so tired, in fact, that you crashed on the couch while reading her a story.

You didn't even notice that Scoots put a blanket over you.

Your dreams were feverish. Dark, violent dreams. Vampires all over you. Or going after Scoots. Something clawing at your very soul. Eating away at you. Like.. something was trying to consume you from the inside, out. A giant, dark beast.. with huge claws.. and fangs..

..you'd awake at about three in the morning, not noticing that your couch and blanket is covered in sweat, and go get a stiff drink. Then another. And go to your proper bed.

The nightmares came, again.. horrible, horrible visions. Physical pain. The feeling that something is clawing at your flesh.

You awaken just after dawn, the nightmares gone, and find that you had been holding your Ka-Bar all night. In a death grip. There were fresh stab marks on the headboard. They joined others that had appeared over the course of the last few weeks.

Downstairs.. it was your day off.. you could sleep in, but you now dreaded the idea of sleeping. You made breakfast for two, and sat and ate, leaving Scoots' breakfast in the hot pan with the lid over it, to keep it warm.

She came down the stairs a bit later - around sixish - and fetched her breakfast from the stove. She looked hesitant to sit at the table, but did so anyway. She ate in silence. You were reading the paper.. finally, though, she spoke up.

"Anon, we're all very worried.." Scoots blurted out.

"About.. about what, Scootaloo?" Taken aback, you set the newspaper down.

"I've.. I've told.. my teacher about your nightmares.. and Princess Luna.. and Princess Celestia.. and.. we're all very worried." She looked down. "I'm sorry I didn't tell you.. but.. they told me not to." She shrugged. "They said they weren't sure how you'd react to us all talking about you behind your back.."

"I-!" You wanted to be angry, but looking at her face.. you just couldn't. "I don't know what's wrong with me, either, Scootaloo. I have these horrible nightmares.. violent nightmares.."

"I know. You.. you scream in your sleep. I've.. I've gotten up to see if you were okay, and seen you stabbing your headboard.." She looked away. "I.. understand.. I guess.. if it was just screaming.."

"You were worried I'd hurt you." You lower your head in shame. That was the last thing you wanted.

"I'm sorry.." She sighed a little.

"I'd never hurt you. Ever. I mean.." You shake your head. "..something's definitely wrong with me, though. I think I'll go to the palace today and see if Celestia has time to talk to me." You nod.

"Alright!" She seemed happy about this. That you were getting help.

After getting her ready for school, and seeing her off - she'd made new friends, by now, and they were just as awesome as Sweetie-Belle and Apple Bloom - you got dressed and headed for the Royal Palace.

After a couple hours of waiting, Celestia found time to see you, in her private study.

"Your Royal Highness.." You bow your head a little.

"Anon." Celestia nodded back, and motions for you to join her at the table with tea.

"Your Highness, I.. I know that you've spoken to Scootaloo and you were afraid about how I'd react to everyone talking behind my back.." She had a momentary 'annoyed' look, but it passed. "..but, if I'd known that my dreams.. my nightmares.. were scaring her, I would've sought your help immediately. I.. I don't mind suffering.. I guess that's a human condition.. you know, as long as it's just me?" You shrug, and sit down, taking a sip of tea.

"We were.. concerned, yes.." Royal Sunbutt shrugged. "I had no idea you had such dangerous things in your possession.." The guns.

"And the weapons.. suggest I'm violent and prone to harm others?" Typical reaction, really.. a lot of people thought that way about people that owned firearms.

"Well, they don't suggest that your life was at peace and free from danger - and the danger serious enough that you must have protection. And lots of it." She shrugged.

"Most of them were just range toys." You'd had three huge trunks of guns and ammunition in your truck when you'd ended up here - you'd been moving, and for safety, decided the weapons all had to go at once. You had abandoned your old gun safe (it was too full anyway) and had been planning on buying a new one 'in the morning.' Then you woke up with your truck wedged between two trees as though it'd been sat down there by a child, and the rest was history. "You know.. for fun. Like how Unicorns practice magic for fun. Magic can be very destructive if used in the wrong way." Trixie. "But, yes, some of them were for my own protection. The place I lived wasn't safe. Humans aren't like ponies, and it's very possible that I could have been assaulted by one, for the cash in my wallet, or something as simple as my shoes. I don't seek to harm others, Your Highness, but I would be utterly careless and inviting harm, to not be prepared to protect myself, or those I care about." You shrug. "This is exactly why I locked those things away. Both because I didn't think I'd need them here, and because I didn't want anyone to think I was violent or dangerous. I'm not. I'm just prepared."

"I see." She seemed pretty satisfied with this answer. "I must admit, they did come in handy. Without them, the vampires might have over-run Equestria.."

"And as it is, the Elements of Harmony are all but one, without an owner." You bowed your head in respect.

"..yes.." Celestia, respectfully, bowed her head, too. Twilight had been like her own daughter. "About your nightmares.." Back on track.

"They're horrible." You lift up your shirt to show what you dared not show Scootaloo that morning.

Claw marks down the sides of your torso. They were bandaged, but.. the blood was seeping through.

"..they won't stop bleeding." You say with a note of concern. "If I wasn't going to come here, I would have gone to the hospital."

"Oh, my!" Celestia approached the bandages, getting her face close to them, and giving them a sniff. She backed up a little. "Anon, I think you've been cursed, somehow." She shook her head. "I can help heal those wounds, but.. if the curse is allowed to continue, you may eventually die from it."

"I don't suppose this can be fixed with a magic Zebra potion or two?" You shrug as she enchants your wounds, bidding them to close.

"No. You.. would have to find out what cursed you." The Princess gave a slight shrug. "After that, we would know what to do."

"I can only guess what - one of the vampires from Ponyville. But, they're all dead. Who do we know that's a vampire?" You came right out with it.

"..welllll.. there has been a vampire living in Equestria for centuries.. but she has never troubled anyone." She shook her head a little. "You know her, Anon.."



Part II: Interview with a VamPony

An hour later, you were in a private study. Classical music plays gently in the background.

"I thought vampires couldn't walk in the daylight?" You asked, making yourself comfortable in the chair you were offered.

"I've long since transcended that.. disability." Octavia Melody looked away a moment, and went back to her cello.

"Scratch?" You asked offhand, accepting the tea that was poured for you when you came in. She'd been expecting this.

"She and I are.. very close.. but she isn't one." She blushed a little.

"Blood Doll." You stated. It wasn't that hard to figure out. "She still has her Free Will."

"You know much of us, it seems." She set down the bow on its rest and put the cello aside. "There are vampires in your world?"

"Many people wish so. But, no, they're only old legends and fables." You shrug a little. "Who turned you into a vampire?"

"A very dear friend. Or so I thought. He was my special SomePony.. and he offered me the chance to spend eternity with him. I thought he meant.. something else." She shook her head. "I was ashamed at what I'd become, so.." She looked away.

"There are others, then." This was becoming pretty clear, now.

"Yes. Though the outbreak in Ponyville - I assure you - had nothing to do with us." She seemed firm about this.

"It was Fluttershy. But that's a Royal Secret. The whole incident is being whitewashed." You gave her a frustrated shrug.

"So, it WAS magical.." She seemed concerned by this. "..who performed the spell? Twilight?"

"Rarity. Fluttershy bamboozled her into thinking it was a beauty spell." You gesture with your hand a little, dismissively. "Her obsession with me. If only I'd just let her.. you know.. maybe, this wouldn't have happened."

"Don't blame yourself. Fluttershy chose her own path. But I can say that when it started, I did feel a presence among the vampires that were created. The spell - if it's the one I think it was - should have caused them to multiply infinitely until a single Master or Mistress arose from their ranks. But.."

"That didn't happen. Someone felt that happening, came, and took control." A nod. "Father Waddle and Sweetie-Belle used some kind of vortex spell to cast the Vampires into a Void of some kind."

"I'm familiar with that spell. It's not one hundred percent effective, and rather indiscriminate. It.. tried to take you, did it not?" Her little English-y accent was delicate. This was obviously troubling her.

"It did." You nodded, remembering what it was like to try and breathe in a hurricane.

"If you were cursed by an older vampire, then I would assume they took the opportunity to inflict it once the Vortex was done. Had you lost consciousness?" Octavia asked, with a small nod.

"Yes, I did." You shrug. "It's not easy to breathe in all that wind. How.. did you get away?" You lean in a little.

"I sensed the presence, and knew it was nothing good. So, I took my dear Scratch and simply walked away. My age allowed me to.. keep the younglings from attacking us." She shrugged a little. "Before you ask, I could not tell you whom the Presence was, only that it was familiar to me."

"That works. Now, do you have any suspicions?" It's not like Vampires have a rolodex of other Vampires.

"I do.. actually.. it might've been Nightly Whisper. He was a.. very beautiful stallion. But he's also a master of disguise." She looked towards the window. "Honestly, he could look like any stallion he wanted to. And I can guarantee that the one he is impersonating, he's turned into one of him."

"How has this gone.. like.. unchecked, all this time?" A look of concern from you - it's like everything else here. No one cares until it explodes in their faces.

"Because we keep to ourselves, and problem ponies like this are usually dealt with." She put emphasis on those last two words. "He, it seems, was not." She then looked down. "I was involved with him, once.." Octavia said, regretfully.

"Can you help me? You're the only vampire I know. I need to be able to find him. And lift this curse." You lift your hand a little.

"I cannot go against one of my own kind - much less one more powerful than I. But I can give you something that will allow you to detect our kind." She got up from her seat and walked over to her book case, withdrawing a small box. She handed the whole thing to you. "Inside is a pair of special glasses - Silvered-Lensed Spectacles. They allow those with no power at all, to see things that are hidden from them. Wear them, and you will be able to see vampires for what they truly are."

"Alright." You take them out and put them on, to test them, and look at Octavia. Sure enough, through the lenses, you can see her fangs and sunken eyes. Taking them off, they go away. "I still think of you as a friend, Octavia. You being a vampire doesn't change anything." You get up, and put a hand on her shoulder.

"You.." A single tear forms and is quickly wiped away. "..have no idea what that means."

"I do. In a small way." You give her a grin. "I'll show myself out."



Part III: The Departure

With a newfound tool in your posession, you decide to simply walk around and inspect everything you can. Hidden signs and sigils all over the place were revealed to you with the Spectacles.

Perhaps a dozen or more of these things were around Canterlot. That made things fascinating. You have no idea what they mean, but just seeing them, gives you a hint about what the truth of things really is - that there are many things Celestia either doesn't know about, or allows to exist.

You did return home before Scoots. You had to do something - you had to break this curse. Otherwise, she'd be all alone again. For some reason, that hurt you more than the idea of dying horribly from the curse itself.

You were in your locked storage room, rummaging around for things, when you heard her get home. Early.

Putting things back, you step out quickly. She's standing in the doorway in her school uniform, looking.. no, staring at you.

"What is it?" You ask her, suddenly startled.

"You're going to go away, aren't you?" She came out with it.

"I have to break this curse, Scoots.." You look down, with shame.

"You can't do it alone." She shook her head.

Scootaloo dumped out her school bag, went to the bathroom, and started putting things in there. Bandages, antiseptic, whatever she thought was handy.

"No! NO! Scoots, you're-" You start to object.

She stops, and turns to look at you.

"Anon, you're literally all I have left." She sat on the stool in the bathroom, and looked down. "If I don't go with you and something happens to you, what's going to happen to me?!" She looked back up, tears in her eyes. "You're.. family!"

"Scoots.." You bow your head in shame. "..I feel the same way. If you came with and I couldn't protect you.." I sighed.

"So? It's better than dying alone, isn't it?!" She demanded.

"Yeah, I suppose." You look down and shake your head. "You sure about this?"

"As sure as I've ever been about anything in my life." She stomped the ground with her right forehoof. "Besides.." She walked over to you. "..who else's going to help you?"

"Okay. Be sure to pack food and matches." You shrug, giving up.

It occured to you just how much these ponies were assholes, if the only one jumping to come help you is a 12-year-old filly. One that kinda acts like a neice or daughter, or has, since you two had to move in with each other.

Of course, if the Elements were all still alive, they might feel they 'had' to help you, after Twilight browbeat them into it. Still, did that mean courage was that badly lacking in their society?

"You got it, Anon." She nodded and went to the kitchen.

You went back to your arms room and went to stock up. You'd want a lighter weapon, this time around. Something that could do most anything asked of it. And a sidearm.

Your choice is your hand-assembled AR-15. Built from parts, it had a 16-inch Rainier Arms Ultramatch barrel, Daniel Defense receiver and internals, Magpul MOE foregrip, genuine Colt Type 4 stock, and on top, a 1-4x Vortex Crossfire.

Magpul PMAGs helped reduce weight, but you opted for high end ammo, Hornady 75gr match grade stuff. Your rifle could hit sub-MOA on a good day.

For a sidearm, you picked your Glock 34, with an Aimpoint T1, and a Surefire weaponlight. Yeah, it was originally a range toy, but Glocks were hard to beat, and the optic might come in handy. Never mind the light. Magazines were all baseplate-extended to 20 rounds.

The rest of your weapons were stowed carefully. Six rifle magazines, six pistol magazines, two old Airsoft-grade smoke grenades, some road flares, multitool, and that M9 Bayonet. All on your chest rig, or the thigh rig for your Glock.

At the last minute, you grabbed your old machete - for clearing brush and looking cool while doing it - and the scabbard that went with it. You walked over to Scootaloo and knelt down.

"Just in case I can't be there." You say, as you affix it to her.

"You're really serious?!" She hugged you. "Th-thanks.."

"You're right. I can't do this alone." You shrug. "As much as I'd like to think I can.. or I'd rather be the only one suffering."

"Okay. What's our first step?" She'd ask, looking up at you.

"First, we follow the trail. Octavia told me-"

"She's one of them?!" She seemed a bit afraid.

"There's lots of them out there, apparently, Scoots. Just.. they don't bother anyone. As I was saying, Octavia told me that she's pretty sure the one that cursed me is a Pony named Nightly Whisper. But, he's likely impersonating someone." You gesture to the spectacles. "These will let me see vampires and other things for what they really are."

"Okay. So.. where do we start?" She shrugged.

"Ponyville. He was there when this happened, so, he probably lived in town or something. The whole event lasted just a few hours, so, he couldn't have lived very far away." You look to the window. "Come on, I want to get going."

The two of you catch the next train out, and make it clear you want to stop at the old Ponyville Station.

While the conductor wasn't pleased with the idea, you being a human kinda convinced him it was a good idea to just go with it.




Part IV: The Scene of the Crime

When you got to Ponyville, though, you came upon something you didn't want to see. Didn't want to imagine. Didn't want to think was possible.

In the ruins, were monsters. Genuine monsters.

"I get the feeling someone's trying to cover his tracks." You cross your arms and snort.

"Ehh! What ARE those things!?" She asked, recoiling a bit in horror.

"Monsters, Scoots. All kinds, too. I see Mermen, Werewolves.. ghouls, lots of ghouls.." You shake your head.

"Got a plan?" She slid her machete out.

"Stay close. These things are probably going to come after ME the second I get near them." You hand the spectacles to Scoots. "You start scanning for anything unusual - I'll handle the monsters."

You heft your AR-15, and start pacing towards the ruins. Covering Scoots would be a lot easier than her trying to cover you or play lookout while you investigate.

Almost immediately, several ghouls started pacing towards you. Made up of long-dead Ponies, these ghouls were rotting abominations. You sighted in on the first one, and double-tapped to the head. Fortunately, these things aren't purely magical, and this terminated the creature.

"Lead works." You nod.

"I'm looking around.. I see glowy stuff that looks like letter fragments or something." She was looking all over the place. "I'll copy down what I can see." She pulled out a sketchpad and pencil, then set to work.

"Covering you."

You flick your eyes left and right. This wasn't a game, this was real, and her life depended on your reaction speed.

A Merman.. mer.. pony.. ergh. Creature from the Black Lagoon, but on four legs/fin-legs. It came up to the left of you, and looked ready to hock a loogie - which probably means a fireball. You pivot-spin to a knee, and fire three times at its neck and head. The creature fell backwards, spit its fire straight up, and collapsed. The fireball hit the monster's body, and scorched it.

"How's it coming?" You ask, the company starting to get a little crowded.

"I need some more time.." She sighed.

"Got it."

You rise and pivot, deciding to expand your fire radius a bit more. They were kinda making their general way towards you. Double-taps, now. Mermen first, ghouls second. The werewolves (actually, they look like Timber Wolves on two legs, with fur) were last, and you'd change mags before engaging. Headshots for them. They'd go down, alright.. but then they'd get right back up.

"I was afraid of this." You scowl. "Werecreatures are only vulnerable to silver." You look down to Scoots. "Copy what you can, we have to move. I can't stop the werebeasts."

"Alright.. alright, I've got most of it." She got up and got behind you. "Uhm.. next train isn't for almost an hour. What'd'we do?"

"Fall back. And keep falling back until we reach some kind of safety." You shrug. "You want to chance going to Zecora's?"

"Sounds like an idea." She shook her head. "She might even know something."

"Alright, stay close." You comfort her with a quick headpat.

Exiting the area around Ponyville revealed that the Werebeasts would not pursue you beyond a certain distance. That distance, however, did include the Train Station, so.. you were kinda cut off. And with no Spike or anything like that, you had no way of alerting the Palace to this development, for the time being.

So, you'd set off for Zecora's. Perhaps the learned Zebra has some ideas...


Part V: The Stripes of Conflict

"Zecora!" You yell, as you near her hut.

"You think she's okay?" Scoots asks, trodding carefully.

"No idea." You shrug. "ZECORA! WHERE ARE YOU!?"

"Anon! Over there!" She pointed with a hoof.

Sure enough, Zecora was in her garden. Problem is, she's turned to stone. You aren't sure if this is Nightly Whisper's doing, or what.

"Be careful, Scoots. I feel.. something here."

Indeed, your curse gives you the ability to feel dark intentions. Something evil is here.

*HISSSSSS*

"Oh, that's not good." You curse yourself. "Scoots, trust me, whatever you do, don't look up."

"O-Oh.. kay.. um.." She looks at the ground, and backs up.

You, however, dig in your stuff for your hand mirror. Yep, you can guess where this is going and hope this mirror will do the trick.

"Medusa!" You call. "You out there, hot stuff?"

*SSSsss!*

"Why don't you.. SEE for yourself!?" The voice is to your left.

"Kinda rather not! My dick may get hard as diamonds, but I don't wanna get stoned with you!" Snarky humor? Why not!

"Ss-Sss-Ssss-Sssssssss!" Was that a chuckle? It's getting closer.

You look up, but with the mirror covering your eyes. The rest of your vision, around the edges, catches sight of a Medusapony. Rather, the body of one. Instinctively, she tries to petrify you with her vision, but with your eyes blocked by the mirror, she does indeed succeed in only petrifying herself!

Mirror's hot, now, though.

"Ow! Motherfucker!" You drop it, and wag your hand.

However, you see the results of your handiwork. She's turned to stone. You go over and prod the statue gently.

"You okay, Scoots?" You ask.

"Yeah! What WAS that?" She paces up next to you.

"A Medusa." You shrug. "Somehow, someone is creating monsters or resurrecting them from ancient times."

A look at Zecora's statue, and you shrug.

"I.. don't think she's coming out of it." You frown in exasperation.

"Maybe if we.." Scoots started, and pushed over Medusa's statue, shattering it. "Ooo.. the statue bleeds.." She sniffed the blood, and pulled back. "Ew!"

Slowly, Zecora comes out of it. Seems the curse isn't fully broken until the Medusa is completely dead. You go over to her, as she slowly lowers to the ground.

"Zecora! It's me, Anonymous!" You lift her head.

"Oohhh.. my bell was rung, my muscles stiffened, when that creature attacked me unbiddened.." She rubbed her head. "Anonymous and Scootaloo.. you rescued me, true.. but why do you come? You could not have known what I'd become."

"Zecora, I've heard you talk normally. Now quit it. I don't have time for this crap. I'm cursed by a VamPony, and the curse may be fatal, according to Celestia. Worse, that vampony has created or resurrected monsters from all over the place, and I can't kill them all!" You frown. "Werebeasts need silver. I haven't got any." A shrug.

"I thought my speech forms true, were a mystery to you?" She tilted her head. "Oh, whatev'a.." She slipped into a more natural Kenyan-like accent. "..a caurse, you saye?" She rose to her hooves.

"Yeah.. he's been having violent nightmares.. it scared me." Scoots shrugged. "I.. had to come with.."

"She hasn't got anyone left, really. All the Elements are dead except Applejack." You shrug again. "I have no idea what I'm doing, here. Well, actually, I kinda DO... but.."

"Please, come inside.." Zecora bids you as she makes for her cabin.

"Covering." You say as you take up Tail End Charlie, with Scoots in the middle.

Once inside Zecora's cabin, it's clear someone had been rummaging around in here.

"I feah whomevah did this, has taken a precious item." She frowned and paced over to some of the open boxes. "Oh, deah.." She sighed. "It's true. They've stolen an item quite dangerous to all of you." She looks at you and lowers her head. "The caurse is not something I can break. Moreover, you find yahself undahprepared." She glanced around a bit, shrugged in frustration, and sat down. "You requiah the services of a powerful mage.. and a weapon that can fight 'dese creatures equally."

"Okay.. answer me this.. if I had silver bullets, would that help?" You tilt your head at her.

"Yes. Silvah bullets consecreted in holy power ah an effective remedy to all 'de undead, an' most any monstah." She shrugs.

"M'kay. And, just to ask, you're not powerful enough to really help, are you?" You gesture.

"Nah. De best I can do for you right now is tah mix up a potion tah keep de caurse at bay a while longah." She gets up and starts gathering materials.

"How... long does 'Non have?" Asks Scoots, fearfully.

"Ah.. is difficult to sey.. his soul is different from ours, child." She looks back at me. "De more impure de soul, de fastah de curse works." She finishes as she sets to work.

"Lovely. I'm.. pretty sure I'm burning the candle at both ends, then." You shrug.

"Mm.. pahaps a couple months. No longah." She shakes her head, still mixing ingredients. "Even dis potion won't help too much. But, it should forestall any more nightmeah wounds, eh?" She points at your abdomen. "Brave of you ta hide 'dem from Scootaloo."

"Non..?" She looks at you, afraid.

"Yeah, it's true. It started last night." You shrug, and pet her mane a bit.

"Den y'have pahaps t'ree weeks." She said bluntly, handing you an icky green potion.

You drink it. It tastes like shit mixed with fly guts and raw potato.

"UGH!" You make a face.

"De best medicine tastes de worst." She pats your shoulder.

"We need to get back to Canterlot. As fast as possible. On foot, it's what, a couple days?" You shrug. "I hate taking that much time."

"Catch a train. I can give yah a small amount of powdah that'll keep werebeasts at bay a while." She finished mixing that up, and handed it to you. "Don't apply it until you hafta."

"Thank you, Zecora." You sigh, and pat Scoots on the shoulder.

"Zecora..?" She tilts her head at the Zebra.

"I be fine, child. Won' be de first time I had to move on." She shook her head.

"I hope I see you again, Zecora." You say as you get to the door.

"Aye, child. Me, too." She gives you a warm smile as you depart.




Part VI: The Report

The trip back to Canterlot wasn't easy. Waiting on the train was the hard part. It took two hours before it passed through, and you had to manually signal it to stop. But, you got back, and went straight to the palace, even though it was now sundown.

"It's a matter of life or death. MY life." You tap your chest at the guard.

"Her highness is preparing for bed! You can wait until tomorrow." He retorts.

"I can't. I have maybe three weeks to live." You sigh hard. "I need every minute I can get, and I'm not.. making any progress here." You shake your head.. and look at Scootaloo. "Back my play?"

"Sure!" She beams at you.

"What.. are you-"

You whip out your Glock, fire a round at the nearest statue to demonstrate what it can do, then pull the guard into a rear-naked choke, gun to his temple. His fellow guards level their spears at you as Scootaloo whips out her machete, and sticks the tip to the Guard's royal jewels.

"Another step, he becomes she." She demands. "NOW GO GET THE PRINCESS!" She yells at them.

"You guys left me no choice, here." You shake your head.

"Sir?!" The second guard looked at the hostage.

"DO WHAT HE SAYS! THAT BLADE IS COLD!" His eyes are VERY wide.

One of the guards departs. A moment later, though, Twilight Velvet comes up from the opposite direction, and steps over next to you.

"Anonymous." She nods her head slightly. "What's going on, here?"

"Uhm.. hey." A defeated sigh.

You frown and lower your head. You hadn't actually spoken to her since it happened. She knew WHAT happened, but..

"You guards, lower your spears. Non, let him go." She used Mommy Tone.

It's Very Effective.

Everyone disarms, and you reholster.

"Mrs. Velvet.." You start.

"Hold on, Nony." She waits and Celestia comes out of the side hall in her robe. "Celestia, Anonymous and Scootaloo need to talk to us."

Us?

"Very well." She narrowed her eyes at you a moment, but directed you to a side room and dismissed her guard.

"Princess Celesita-" You start.

"Don't do that again." She simply states.

"I didn't have much of a choice. They wouldn't listen." You square up.

"I'll make sure I'm available to you until this situation is resolved." She shrugs. "Unless I'm asleep."

"About that." Twilight Velvet started. "I received a carrier pidgeon from Zecora." She looks at you, then Celestia. "He's not just cursed, Your Highness, he's dying. Fast. He has maybe three weeks."

"..oh." That knocked the wind from her sails.

"It gets worse." You continue. "There's monsters all over Ponyville. Real monsters. Dangerous, deadly creatures. My weapons are.. not a hundred percent effective. Werebeasts require silver to kill.."

"I don't have the Elements of Harmony, Anonymus. I have no idea what I can possibly do to stop them." She turns to look at you, and shakes her head. "We don't have warriors in our society. We have no way to FIGHT those things." She lowers her head. "Now, all of Equestria is in danger."

"I need fifty pounds of silver, and a powerful mage. Someone as good as.." You look at Twilight's mother. "..your daughter."

"She.." Mrs. Velvet looked down. "..did they suffer?" Her and Spike.

"One round each. It was instant. I don't think she even realized what happened." You reassure her. "Really, this is all my fault.. if I'd just let Fluttershy.. use me.." You lower your head.

"No one deserves that, Anon." Celestia pawed the ground. "You had no idea she'd try this. Even if you did, I could not ask one of my subjects to endure something like that." She shook her head and looked down. "I chose poorly when I picked her. But she seemed so.. kind. Innocent."

"Personally, I think someone corrupted her!" Scootaloo piped up.

"You know, I hadn't thought about that. Who told her that such a spell existed in the first place? Who got her on this idea of fetishes? Who twisted her adoration of me to such a horrible extent?" You continue the thought.

"That may be it." Celestia looked up.

"Nightly Whisper." You finish. "Octavia told me about him." You look at Mrs. Velvet.

"I see." She lowers her head a bit.

"So.. do we know anyone as strong as Twilight Sparkle?" You look at them both.

"Sunset Shimmer." Mrs. Velvet says with a heavy heart. "She was banished, though."

"Yes, I banished her to a mirror dimension.." Celestia looked up at you. "..I can send you there to retrieve her. Offer her this deal - if she helps destroy this threat to Equestria, then she may return, and we will see about trusting her again."

"Look, you need an Element of Magic anyway." You shrug. "I don't know what she did-"

"She started training at the same time as my daughter. But, she was too ambitious. She wanted everything immediately. And.." She looked to Celestia.

"She crossed me, more or less, and then when she left, I locked the mirror away so she couldn't return." Celestia nods for you to follow.

"So.. I have to go to another world and get her to come back?" You tilt your head.

"She's the most powerful mage I've ever seen." Celestia confessed. "Even Twilight was.. a small mark below her potential."

You find yourself in a locked store room. There's a large mirror here, and a cloth secured over it.

"Aha." You point to the mirror. "That thing?"

"Indeed." Celestia shrugged. "I have no idea exactly where it leads." She looks at Scootaloo. "You stay here."

"BUT!" She protests.

"I mean it, little one." Celestia bowed her head over Scootaloo. "I can feel how much you want to help him, but this part of the journey, you can't. Please. Trust me."

"I'm guessing this other world is a reflection of this one, and if she went and encountered her other self, bad things would happen?" You ask.

"Indeed." Celestia nods. "You might want to leave your dangerous things here."

"Probably a good idea."

You take off all your weapons and gear, leaving you only in a Coyote Tan T-shirt, khaki cargo pants, and black boots.

"No telling what that other world is like." She nods. "Here." She hands you a sack full of Bit coins. "You may need that."

"Good luck, Anonymous." Mrs. Velvet gently rubs her head against your thigh.

"Oh, what's she look like?" You ask, before stepping through.

"Hm. Red and gold striped hair.. that alone should be enough." She shrugs.

"Alright. I'll be back." You nod, and step through.




Part VII: The Looking Glass

Canterlot, Colorado.

United Fucking States of America.

You step out in another closet alright, and you can hear people moving around. You're in a school of some kind, that much you can figure out by the bell ringing and people walking.

Some kind of supply closet.. hmm. Aha! You find a jumpsuit that says 'Custodian' on it, and quickly get it on, along with a baseball cap. It's a good thing you have your old wallet on you. Grabbing up a mop and wheeled bucket, you exit the closet.

And you're in a High School. You immediately recognize most of the students here, in the halls, as the dead denizens of Ponyville. It makes you a little sad, of course. But, you put your head down and start wheeling the bucket down the hallway.

Rules for other worlds? Minimize contact with everyone and everything. Assume nothing. In this case, this world seems to be a humanized reflection of Equestria. Complete with most of these humans having technicolor pastel skin. Strange. Yours looks like a pastel version of what your skin normally is.

"Custodian!" You hear a voice.

It's Celestia, as a human... ohhh.. what a BABE.. what MILF.. mmm.

"Yes, ma'am!" You move over to her.

"Ah.. you must be new." She tilts her head.

"Uhm, yeah." You shrug. "This is my first day, ma'am."

"Right. We were expecting a new custodian. Anon Y Mous, yes?" She tilts her head at you.

"Yes, ma'am." You stay respectful.

It seems everyone that comes here, has a place made for them. How interesting. You were a custodian once, yourself, so this isn't strange territory for you.

"Well. I'm glad you're here. We need a clean-up in the lunch room. There was an accident at breakfast." She shrugs. "There are maps along the halls if you need to find your way. Since you're the only Custodian we have.. I'm afraid we're going to ask a lot of you." She pats your arm sympathetically.

"Yes, ma'am. I'll do my best." You nod.

And now.. in a way, you've got everything you want. You're back home.. sort of. You're among humans again... sort of. You have gainful employment.. sort of. But.. you have a time limit. Three weeks at best.

So, you have a choice. Find Sunset and convince her to come back with you.. or.. stay here and slowly die among your people. Sort of.

Since you'd rather NOT die, you decide to go to the cafeteria and clean up the mess.

Fortunately, it's not puke. It's eggs. All over the place. You know from experience the easiest way to get eggs up is either cook them in place (thanks Three Stooges!) and sweep them up, or get the sawdust.

You opt for the sawdust, as you're not a frustrated short order cook.

The cafeteria cook.. is Roseluck. Your last memory of her pony form was her getting fed on by vampires.

"So.. you're the new Custodian?" She asks, as you spread the sawdust.

"Yes, ma'am." You nod. "Mm.. those leftovers?"

Looks like pork sausage, scrambled eggs, toast, bacon, and all the breakfast fixins.. considering you'd settled on having nothing but oatmeal and eggs with an occasional ham steak for all of your breakfasts, this looks pretty good.

"Yeah. I'm Rose. Rose Luck. Uhm.. you hungry?" She asks, in that polite 'I don't want to pry, but you look like a charity case' sort of way.

"Sure. After I get the mess up, that is." Don't want to seem too eager..

So, after you get the mess up, Rose sits you down and feeds you. You can't help but look at her. The first human you've seen in five years, one that's close to your social class. And a female, your preferred type. With a nice body. And kind manners.

"This is really good. Do you cook all this, or do you get most of it premade and frozen?" You ask.

"Oh, we get the raw ingredients. My sisters and I cook everything. Sisters! We're not even related, but we ARE really good friends." She smiles, kinda leaning in a bit.

"Maybe you can help me." You start.

Time for a damn good cover story - you hope these ponyhumans are as gullible as real ponies. If not, you hope your many hours of watching suspects be stupid on Law & Order and learning from their mistakes, pays off.

"With what?" She tilts her head, letting a red lock slip over her face a little.

"I'm hoping to meet up with a long lost cousin of mine. Sunset." You shrug. "It's a long story, but, we're distantly related. Everyone close to me is long dead, I.. kinda took the job here, hoping to meet up with some kin folk. You know. So the holidays aren't so lonely." You give her a small shrug.

"Sunset's related to you?" She leans back a bit.

"Distantly. I think it was our great-grandfolks that were siblings." You geture. "I found out about her from a geneology website."

"Ohh! Yes, yes, I get you.." She nods, with a small grin. "..so, all your close family are dead?" She frowns. "How sad! I mean, do you even have anywhere to go?" She tilts her head.

"Well.. I didn't get that figured out, either. See, I.. I have some gold coins from the old family collection from ages ago. I was gonna pawn those and hope to get a room or something." You are absolutely savoring the sausage - ponies can't make this worth a damn.

"Oh.. you poor dear. And I bet you came by bus!" She seemed upset.

"Yeah.." You shrug. "..and I got here in time for my first day of work, at least."

"The pawn shop will be closed by the time you get out of here tonight." She shakes her head just a little. "Until you can get a chance to talk to Sunset, and get yourself set up, I want you to stay with me." She shuts her eyes and nods firmly.

What was that rule about MINIMAL CONTACT!?

"Aw, I can't ask you to do that!" You protest politely. "You barely know me."

"So? When I came to Colorado, I didn't know anyone, either. Lily took me in for a few months until I could get set up." She reached over and patted your hand. "Besides, I'm sure God would want me to show charity and kindness in return."

God? Is she Christian?

"What denomination?" You ask, politely.

"Roman Catholic." She states.

"Huh." Same as you.

It then occured to you that if your memories of Castlevania were anywhere near correct, the human Vampire Hunters were all sent by The Church. And strong faith played a role in why they did what they did. Maybe, on some level, this meeting was fortunate.

"Your shift ends at five, right?" She presses on.

"Yeah." You shrug.

"Mine, too. Mine's the reddish Civic." She nods towards the parking lot. "You can't miss it."

"Okay.. well, if you say so." You chuckle. "Thanks."

After a hearty breakfast, you continue your janitorial duties, watching Sunset as best you can, looking for any hints that she might be symapthetic towards, or missing, her former form. You have no idea if this world is even truly real outside of you two, but you know that even if it isn't, it has its own rules, and you must abide them, or fail your mission. So, you keep it low key this first day, and do intelligence gathering on your subject.

Five o'clock.. quittin' time.



Part VIII: The Luck

True to her word, Rose brought you home. Her apartment is simple, but nice. Decorations from Dollar General, but the pots and pans are Wal-Mart mid-shelf quality. Stuff that'll last a decade or two of careful use. The kitchen is clearly the center of her home, and where most of her expenses seem to go. While the cookware is slightly above average, she has a lot of it, and it's clear this woman spends a lot of time cooking.

"Shower's over there, next to the second bedroom." She points.

"Rose.." You shrug. "..you don't have to be so nice."

"Yes, I do." She states, unpacking the groceries she bought. "You're a kindhearted man, Anon. And a man of God." She sighs. "Maybe it's silly of me, but I long for a day when we can trust each other again, like we used to. All of us. A time when a woman could invite a man into her home as a gesture of kindness, and.. trust them." She paused a moment, shook her head, and continued. "I'm just being silly. Dinner'll be ready in an hour. Go get clean."

"Yes, ma'am." You nod, go to walk away, but stop. "I long for days like that, too." A shrug, and you go to clean up.

What you didn't hear was someone else coming home.

"Momma! I'm home!" Came the voice.

"Hey, sweetie. Wash up for dinner - use the kitchen sink, we have a guest!"

"Okay, momma!"

The thoughts come to your head. Why she was so free to discuss her faith. Bring it up, even. Her age, the apparent youth of the voice.. it made sense. Either she made a mistake as a teenager and atoned for it by turning to God, or she had something bad happen to her, and investing in her Faith was how she coped.

You finished your shower and.. realized you should have brought more clothes. No matter. You dressed in your work clothes and came out. A young girl is washing her hands, you recognize her from school.

Roseluck the Pony didn't have a filly. That right there proved this dimension wasn't one of shadows. These were real people with real lives.

"Hey, there! I saw you in the first grade!" You point at her as you place the used towels carefully in the dirty clothes hamper.

"Oh, you're the new custodian!" She giggled. "I'm Tulip! Tulip Luck."

You look at Rose.

"She's my precious flower." She grins.

"Can I help?" You just drop it.

"Oh.. well-l.. can you chop vegetables?" Rose tilts her head.

"Minced or diced?" You go about selecting your weapon of kitchen warfare, and pulling down the cutting board.

"Uhm... diced." She's taken aback a little that you even know this.

"Which ones and how much?" You point to the assemblage of vegetation on the center island.

"Oh, I know this recipe!" Tulip beamed. "Five carrots, five celeries, two ears of corn, two big potatoes, and four tomatoes." She nodded.

"Very good, honey. You even inflated it for one more person." Rose smiled.

"Do you help Mom a lot in the kitchen?" You ask Tulip.

"Sure do!" She beams. "I wanna be an awesome cook, just like her!"

"Oh, honey.." Rose blushes.

"Well, I'm no expert like your Momma, but I know my way around a sharp thing.." You rack and stack the carrots, and go cutting away.

Your skill with a knife on vegetables has been honed by the last five years of making ham and chicken based stews. Before the Incident, that is. By neccesity, they had to contain a lot of vegetables. Dicing them makes them cook quickly. Rose was searing up some actual beef, though.

After a bit, you have everything neatly diced.

"This good?" You ask, bowing your head a bit.

"Yes! That's very good!" Rose grins. "Have you done this before?"

"Ehh.. out camping and stuff.. you have to cut your own veggies. Being single, I had to learn for my own sake. Man cannot live on burgers alone." You shrug.

"Oh." She seems both pleased and a bit sad. "I thought someone like you might have someone special.. or had.." She shrugs a little.

"Ehhh.. last five years were kinda dicey for me." You gesture. "I figure I'm a bit too old to really worry about that, any more." Not entirely a lie. "Love is a young person's game. I'm Christmas Cake at this point."

*Giggle!* "You mean you're over 25!" Tulip gives you a toothy grin.

"I'm 37." You pet her head a bit as Rose adds the veggies to the stew.

"Mom's not THAT old!" Tulip says, swaying a bit. "She's only-"

"-old enough to be your mother! Now go set the table, honey." Rose cuts in.

Tulip makes a face and toddles off.

"She's cute." You say, washing the knife carefully.

"She's my pride and joy." Rose looks down with a small grin.

"I can tell." You shrug.

Dinner was nice. For a moment, you let yourself escape reality and pretend you have what you've always wanted: A family that loves you. A wife, a child, a simple but rewarding life. Free of the fears of Vampires, free of the stressors of living in a world of ponies that don't actually accept you, but rather put up with you.

Peace.

For the night, you take the couch-bed.

"It's nice to have this. I got it from the church when I was just getting set up." Rose shrugs as she hands you a pillow.

"It's comfy." More that it's familiar.

"Sleep well." She nods.

"Wake up at zero-five?" You smirk a little.

"Yeah, and it's Friday. I mean, if you have to stay the weekend, I wouldn't mind." She shrugs. "I don't think Tulip would, either."

"Well, I don't want to.. impose.." You try to finish that sentence, but Rose's face makes it clear she isn't taking 'no' for an answer.

"See you in the morning." You finally say.



Part IX: The Nightmare

What was that about the potion working? It seems Zecora's concoction doesn't have any effect on you in this realm. The nightmares come. This time, you're defenseless. No knife, you left it behind in Equestria along with all your other weapons.

You try so very hard to hold in the screaming, letting the demons tear at your tender flesh. A shadowy figure stands next to Rose and Tulip, in the distance. The message is clear - cry out, they suffer.

You endure.

You still bolt awake at 4AM with Rose grabbing on to you.

"Anon! Are you o.." She looks down at her blood-smeared bedsheets.

"Rose.." You tearfully start.

You lower your head.. and pull back the sheets to reveal very clear demonic claw marks on your body. Not deep, but enough to make you bleed.

"Anon..." She just sits next to you, with a first aid kit.

"Let me explain.." You start.

"This is clearly not of this world.." She starts dabbing the wounds in antiseptic.

"No.. it's not." You tear up. "I didn't want this to affect you.. or Tulip.." You hold yourself.

"Tell me everything." She insists.

"Why are you being so nice?" You ask.

"Something tells me that's exactly what you need, right now." She just nods and starts bandaging you.

"I'm from another world." You start. "But it's more complicated than just that." You look out the window. "Originally, I'm from a world of humans, but the humans in my world don't look like this. Our skin isn't as vibrant. The shades and hues of our flesh.. doesn't seem to exist here. Then, five years ago, I was sent to a world much like this one, except everyone there is a pony." You realize how crazy that sounds. "There was an incident.. a powerful spell caused an outbreak of vampires. Hundreds of them. Many were killed. But, I stopped it. By sheer luck." You shrug. "Sunset Shimmer isn't my cousin - she's from that pony world, and we need her. She's the most powerful magic student that world had seen in generations, and I need her help to stop the vampire that cursed me. That did this to me."

"I believe you." She looks up. "Anon.. I.." She looks away.

"You're going to ask if it's possible to fall in love in just one day, aren't you?" You look up, and tilt her chin up.

"Wh.. how.." She starts.

"I was going to ask you the same thing." You smile broadly, but it fades. "I'm living on borrowed time, Rose. In twenty days, this kills me for sure." You look down to your wounds. "Why do you believe me?" You suddenly ask.

"I've always thought stuff like that was either real now, or was real, once, and somehow, it was all destroyed in the middle ages, or something. That maybe one or two of them survived and just blend in. There's enough stories of people just up and vanishing, then people that look kinda like them appearing later." She shrugs a bit.

"I.." You just suddenly kiss her.

She kisses back.

"Rose." You look her in the eye. "I never planned this. I never planned to fall in love with you. The version of you from that pony world.. died.. I.. I couldn't save her. I couldn't save hardly any of them. I did stop them from overruning the world, but.. like I said, it cost me. And now, I might die. I mean, I could stay here the next twenty days and just.. let it take me.." You don't know how to put your feelings into words.

"No." She hugs you, despite the blood. "I didn't think I'd.. fall in love.. either." She blushes.

"Tulip.." You start asking.

"She.." She looks back at the hall, to make sure no little ears were about. "..it's a sin to abort. Even though I didn't have a choice."

That was pretty plain. She was raped, and Tulip is a rape baby. Hard fucking core.. quite the gut punch.

"You're an exceptional woman, Rose." You brush her cheek. "What do I.. we.. do?"

"First thing we need to do is get you alone with Sunset." She nods. "After that.." She glances back at the hallway again. "..what would happen to us if we went back to that world?"

"To be honest, I have no idea." You shrug. "Your alternate self is dead.. so.. I don't think there'd be any problems of two entities existing in the same plane.. but.. if you mean, would you still be human? I can't answer that. I'm not a magician. Magic doesn't exist in the world I originally came from. Not real magic." You gesture.

"Let me.. talk to her." She stands up. "I want to go with you.." And leans in to kiss you cheek. "..but.."

"I wouldn't want anything forced on Tulip, either." You stare her right in the eye, with a Daddy look. "If you can't go, for some reason.. after I kill that vampire.. I'm coming back here." You shrug. "If I can." And you reach up to caress her cheek. "Is there.. a student named Scootaloo in the school?"

She froze up for a second.

"Rose..?" You tilt your head to her.

"She was.." She looked away. "..part of the reason I believed you, is.. a girl by that name was brutally murdered two years ago. The case was strange. The police said she was stabbed in the neck with a barbecue fork.." She trails off.

"She was drained by a vampire, you think." You nod.

"Yes." Rose shrugs.

"Interesting. Likewise, the Rose that I knew in the pony world, didn't have a daughter." You shrug. "So.. I could come back here with her." You trail off. "See, I kinda took her in after what happened." You raise your shoulders a bit. "I kinda feel responsi-"

"SO I'LL HAVE A SISTER!?"

Oh, Lordy..

In zooms Tulip.

"Honey, honey-" Rose tries to stop her.

When she hugs you, though, your whole body feels warm. You can feel the wounds closing.

"What.. the..?" Rose starts.

"O-Oh.. uhm.." Tulip seems afraid, and snuggles in to you.

"Tulip.." You lean into her a bit.

"I can.. do these things.." She blushes, but not from humiliation, rather, fear.

"How, honey?" Rose tilts her head.

"I'm not sure. I've been able to.." She looks up at you. "..I can feel it." She gently touches the wounds.

"Tulip." You sigh.

"Come on. May as well start breakfast." Rose gets up, and ushers her into the kitchen.



Part X: The Confrontation

Rose requested student help for the cafeteria that morning, for lunch preparation. Apparently, Sunset was on some kind of community service, and this could count towards her hours.

This also gave you a perfect chance to corner her.

Sunset was fetching something from the freezer room, when you paced up.

"Sunset. Catch." You flicked her a 10-bits coin.

She caught it.. looked at it.. then looked at you with absolute fear.

"You're fro-" Then saw Rose walk up, as she started to speak.

"Listen carefully. Twilight is dead. They're all dead. Everyone in Ponyville except Scootaloo and a couple others. Fluttershy got Rarity to cast a spell that created legions of Vampires. Those that didn't turn, were brutally eaten. Then, Sweetie-Belle and Father Waddle cast a Vortex Spell and sucked them all into The Void." You put your arm against the wall. "I helped. A lot. I'm natually human, but not like these humans." You shake your head. "An elder vampire was there, he tried to take control of them, and I ruined his plans without realizing it. He's put a curse on me. I have twenty days to live. Celestia is willing to forgive and forget if you're willing to come back and save Equestria. I can't do it alone - I need a mage, Sunset. And you're more powerful than Twilight was." You say, laying it all on the line.

"Tw.. she's.." Suddenly, the bully went from gratified, to depressed. "No.. no! How could that happen!?" She punched the wall. "NOT HER!" Bitter tears.

"I thought you hated her?" You tilt your head.

"No.. not.. not any more." She rubs one arm with her other hand. "I've.. I haven't done well, here. Things are so different. I may have a lot of popularity, but I don't have any real friends." She glances up to you a bit, then back down. "Twilight has friends. Had."

"She was here?" You glance to Rose.

"Yes, yes, come to think of it, she was. Two years ago." Rose tapped her chin a moment.

"She made me realize a lot of things about myself." Sunset looked down. "But.. she had real friends. I have flunkies."

"This is your chance to change all that, AND be seen as a hero to all of Equestria. If you don't, this vampire has already called on hordes of monsters. You KNOW those guards don't stand a chance! Only the Elements did! And all but one of them are DEAD, Sunset." You knife-hand your palm. "You're the only hope the world has. I can't.. I said before, I can't do it alone. There's no way in Tartarus. My guns don't really hurt werebeasts very much. They need Silver. And if I'm going to beat a Vampire that has magic powers, I need someone with magic powers." You wave your open hand to her. "Please. Thousands, tens of thousands of people.. ponies.. are going to die."

"I don't know if I'm good enough." She sighed.

"I don't know if I am, either. But I'm going to try. Who do you want me to take, then? Twilight Velvet? Night Lite?" You open-arm shrug.

"They don't.." A slow sigh. "..alright. I may as well. Living by myself sucks. This school sucks. Everything here.. SUCKS. I should never have left. I.. I was stupid." She hugs herself.

Rose stepped in at that point, and hugged her.

"I'm going with. My daughter, too. I.." She looks at you. "..fell in love with Anonymous, there." And blushes. "You'll have me, too, Sunset."

"Alright." She looks up at you. "Think you can keep up, old man?" And kicks you a grin.

"Any day." You give her a nod. "But, first..." You take the coin back. "I need tools."

Indeed you do. You count on Celestia being able to come up with the silver you need, but you need reloading components and a simple bullet press. You take the rest of the day for your job, and the four of you - Sunset, Rose, Tulip, and you - head to the Pawn Shop after school - Friday was the only day they stayed open past five.

"So.. these gold coins.." The Pawnbroker starts "..I've seen one like these before." He looks at Sunset.

"She's my cousin, sir. They're part of a family treasure, passed down from some bygone age." You shrug.

"I see. Well, they're in remarkably good condition. I got a really good price on these from some collectors last time." He sets down one of the coins. "How many do you have?"

"One hundred and thirty three of different stamped denominations." You nod. "I'd actually like to trade, if you have some of the things I need." You tilt your head.

"I don't carry guns." He narrows his eyes a bit.

"Oh, I already have guns. I need reloading components and a bullet press." You give him a small grin, and whip out your wallet.

From the perspective of that calendar on his wall, your Armed Security License is still valid. That proves you could pass a background check if he wanted to run one.

"..oh. Well. Alright. Grab what you need. I'll tally it against what you've got here." He nods.

So, you set to gathering what you require. Gun powder, casings for your various guns, primers, and a bullet press that will work for what you need. And a bullet mold for each of five calibers. You already have a couple, and the measuring devices.

"Hmm... you know, I think I still owe you a bit of money." The Pawnbroker gives a small grin, gets up, and goes in the back.

He returns with a revolver. A Smith & Wesson Model 686, stainless, pre-lawyer lock. A .357 Magnum.

"Call this a.. private sale." He smirks.

"Well, that tells me you really like those coins." You shrug. "We all set, then?"

"Eheh.. don't expect them gift-wrapped, sonny. But, it's nice to see a young man get in to reloading. It's therapeudic." He shrugs a bit.

"Thank you, sir." You nod.

Off you go. First, to Rose's. She packs up what few things she's decided to bring with her. Her Bible, a small travel case, a suitcase, and some of her nicer kitchen knives. Tulip brings her stuffed bear, and a suitcase full of clothes.

"I don't suppose I'll need these if I turn into a pony, though!" She giggles.

"Well, we'll see, huh?" You pat her head.

Then to Sunset's. She doesn't have much she wants to bring - just her photo album and a couple of trinkets she'd been hanging on to. Besides the album, it all fits in her purse.

"I mean.. I'm going to turn back into a pony, again." She shrugs. "No sense bringing any of my clothes." She looked down to Tulip. "You'll like it, there." She reassures her.

And back to the school. The pawnbroker had left the revolver loaded. You'd checked it. And inside you went - you had kept your keys, even though you shouldn't have. Over to the closet where the mirror was stashed.. and..

"Where's the mirror?!" Sunset freaked a little.

"..I don't think you'll be going.. ANYwhere.." That voice.


Part XI: The Chaos

"Superintendent Discord!" Rose exclaimed.

"Ooohhhh.." You turn slowly, and he's standing there with another man with jet black hair. "..THIS is how you're gonna play me, huh?" You point your left hand at him.

"Play you?" He says in an innocent tone. "Whatever do you mean?" And assumes a false grin, twinkling his fingers together.

"You're the one that sent me to Equestria in the first place!" You demand.

"Maybe I was.. my other me, that is." He grins, with a tinge of evil.

"What do you want?" You say, flatly.

"Oh, just chaos, that's all." He shrugs. "I mean.. what are YOU going to do?" He tilts his head a bit. "Even if you could kill me, you'd be a double-murderer here.. you'd have to kill Sombra, here, too." He gestures to the other man. "Then.. what? You go save Equestria, but what have you got to look forwards to?" He sighed, happily. "No happy ending for you. You can't come back here." He pointed to Rose and Tulip. "And THEY can't leave!"

"Aha.. that's it." You cross your arms. "Two entites can't exist in the same plane at the same time, can they?" Playing dumb - he doesn't know what happened...

"Exactamundo!" He chortles. "And since this is a reflection..?" He straight up villain-laughs. "You can't come back. You break her heart.. both of theirs. You save a world and save your soul, but you're stuck in misery all the rest of your days. After all, what pony could ever love a human?" A wistful grin of pleasure.

You whip that Magnum from under your jumpsuit and fire one-handed right at Sombra's head, between the apex of the eyebrows. T-Zoned, he falls over dead. You then let the gun barrel's tip drop some, and fire a second round into Discord's left knee.

"AH! YOU DAMN LITTLE MONKEY!!" He screams, holding his bullet wound.

I was the Embodiment of Chaos, until I took a .357 Magnum round to the knee!

"Where's the mirror?" You state, flatly. "That choice.. is not a choice. If I died from this curse, and that was it, I wouldn't CARE any more. I don't give a DAMN if those ponies love me or not - they're DEPENDING on me to SAVE them!" You angrily shout. "And I know Rose.. if I abandoned them, she'd never love me again." You glance to her. "And I could never look Tulip in the eyes, ever again. No matter how long I lived."

You dramatically cock the hammer back and aim at his other knee.

"I'm not good with interrogation. WHERE'S THE MIRROR!?" You shout.

"Grrghh.. damn.. your human.. morals!" He clamps down on his femoral artery, just above the knee.

Sunset steps forwards, and pulls out her nail file.. then stabs it right into the bullet wound, and starts digging around in it.

*NGAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!* Discord screams in agony. "DAMN THIS ACCURSED WEAK FLESH!"

"The mirror, Superintendent." Sunset demands. "I never had many scruples until Twilight came. She's dead, now. Seems I have to be that person again, today." She looks back at you. "If it means saving my true home. I'll do it. I'll do whatever it takes. Maybe living among humans taught me I need to be flexible with those morals.." She glares at him. "..you want to see who the real villain is Discord? Humans are chaos. I'm not."

"Ngh.. my.. office.." He squrims. "..you can't move it again, though. I.. made sure of that.." And groans in pain. "..it'll take you.. not.. to Canterlot. Good.. luck. Heh." He winces.

You.. walk over to the wall-mounted first aid kit and open it.

"Where's his office, Rose?" You ask, getting some things out.

"It's at the district building across town." She frowns. "It'll be closed."

"Sunset, get his or Sombra's keys." You walk back over to him, and stuff his wound with gauze.. then take his cell phone. "Sorry, I can't have you calling the cops on me." You frown.

"Sh-showing me.. mercy?" He gets a twinkle in his eye.

"You gave up what I wanted. No reason to kill you." You nod to Sombra's corpse. "I want his handgun, too."

"How..?" Discord starts.

"I saw it when he tried to close his sport-coat. Hip holster. Looks like a Browning Hi-Power. Always wanted one of those." You give him a small grin. "Almost had one on Gunbroker. Even bought the mags for it. But, the seller closed out the deal and abandoned his account. Don't know what happened there." You shrug and finish treating his wound, applying a torniquet.

"Smart." He snorts.

"I'll call you an ambulance when we're ready to step through." You nod to him. "One killing. And I'll have three witnesses that he skinned that smokewagon before I did, on your orders.. self-defense." You smirk.

"Five." That was Principal Celestia's voice.

And out from around the corner she came, with Luna.

"How dense do you think I am, Sunset?" She grinned. "You, too, Anonymous."

"I don't know." You roll back on your feet. Heels touch ground when Slavs squat around.

"He's right on a few things. I can feel.. impressions.. of odd things. I long suspected something supernatural was up." She shrugged. "We weren't expecting a new Custodian. I just played along. I thought you were my counterpart's employee or something, checking up on her." She nodded to Sunset.

"I need her." You state, rising to a stand.

"I can tell. I didn't peg you as needlessly violent. When he started talking about saving the world and such? Then, I knew. There was real trouble." She shrugs. "He didn't leave you much of a choice, did he?"

"Not really. He would have had Sombra shoot us to keep his secret. He was.. WAS in contact with his Mirror self, and may even be a piece of him. But he hasn't spoken to him in some time. MY Rose is dead.. months ago. And my Rose never had a Tulip." You tilt your head.

"Still, you took a human life." She puts a hand on your shoulder.

"I protected people I love." You look right into her eye.

"I see." She gives you a sympathetic grin. "Luna, take them to the District Building. He's probably stuck it in the basement, not his office.." She glared at him. "..oh, do expect a police report, Superintendent. Don't forget, the Police Chief is a very close friend."

Small town politics.



Part XII: The Return

Luna escorted you over to the District Building. Indeed, it was empty, save the ACTUAL custodian. Ferrying you inside, she takes you down to the basement.

"Superintendent Discord had a room set aside for confiscated goods of special mention.." She started. "..he wanted to open up a little mini-museum." She shrugged. "Some museum of delinquency.. a lesson to the kids that we will catch them."

"Not a bad lesson." You smirk.

"Here we go." She opened the door, and indeed, the portal mirror was right there.

Discord and Sombra seem to have affixed it to the wall with large mounting screws. Yup, they made sure it couldn't easily be moved around.

"Well.. here we go." You grasp Rose's hand, your other hand holding the duffel bag with all your stuff. "Thanks for the help, Luna."

"It was needed." She smiles back at you.

Tulip grasps your duffel bag-filled wrist.

"I hope you'll be my Daddy." She looks up at you, with tears in her eyes a little. "Even if I'm a pony."

"You know I will, honey." You say, reassuringly, looking to Rose.

"Let's do this." Sunset moved up, and walked through first.

You walk in, arm in arm, right behind her.

Moments later, you're face to face with Celestia.

Rose.. does not change.

Neither does Tulip.

NIETHER DOES SUNSET...???

"What's.." You look at them, then yourself. Yup, still human.

"Sunset!" Celestia recoils a bit. "You're.. you haven't changed!"

"Huh! What'd'ya know about that?!" She brushes off her skirt.

"How could this happen!?" You ask.

"Sunset.. did you.." Celestia draws near. "..are you still a virgin?"

"UHM.." She turns as red as her hair streaks.

"She had a boyfriend. And I think.. she did what Lite and I did before Twilight was born." Mrs. Velvet gives a small grin.

"Twilight was a bastard?" You ask, dictionarily.

"Ehh.. conceived, not born, out of wedlock." Mrs. Velvet nods to you.

Sunset walks over, drops her bag, and hugs Mrs. Velvet around the neck.

"I'm so sorry.. I.. she taught me.." She started sobbing.

Mrs. Velvet, in a display of supreme motherhood, hugs her back with her right foreleg.

"It's okay, child. It's okay." She comforts her.

"Celestia, I have everything I need.." You look at Rose and Tulip. "This is Rose Luck and Tulip Luck." You shrug. "I.. kinda had a complication.."

"You fell in love." She smiles at you. "It's about time you were no longer alone."

"Scootaloo.." You kneel and bid her to come hug you.

"Nony.." She steps forwards, only for Tulip to hug on her first.

"We're going to be SISTERS!" She announces.

"Wh.." Scoots looks at you.

YOU look at Celestia.

"You told me to take care of her. I want to adopt her and marry Rose." You nod. "And expect there to be an Anon, Jr. some day." A smirk.

"REALLY!?" Scoots lights up like a Christmas Tree.

"Really?!" Celestia is just surprised.

"Yeah, though.. when this is over.. I might go back to the Mirror World with my family." You shrug. "It's not MY Earth, but.." You look between Mrs. Velvet and Celestia. "..it'd be close enough." You shrug widely. "Besides, I have gainful employment. YOU recruited me as a Custodian." You smirk.

"Oh-ho-ho.. really?" She titters. "Seems that mirror is really a mirror of sorts." She wing-shrugs. "You could have stayed."

"And miss the chance to save the world? Not on your crown." You smirk back.

"I'll help, Princess." Sunset finally gets up and wipes her eyes. "Twilight taught me a lot.. it's time I give back and honor her memory."

"I want you to take a little time and get used to the flow of magic, here." Celestia directs. "Anonymous, how long to you need to make the silver bullets?"

"Couple days." You shrug. "I need that silver immediately, though. It doesn't have to be melted down already, I just need a forge I can do it in."

"Hm. The easiest way would be to melt silver 5-bits coins." She leads you out of the closet. "Fifty pounds?"

"At least." You affirm.

"I'll see to it that as many silver items as possible are brought to you." She nods. "The blacksmithing forge here in the castle is yours." She looks to Rose and Tulip. "Want a ride, little one?" She gives that Mommy Grin of hers.

"REALLY!?" Tulip about bounces. "PLEASE, MOMMY!?"

"Better ask.. your father." She looks at you.

"If the princess says it's okay. Remember, she's a princess. Call her that." You nod. "And respect her."

"Of course... Daddy!" She hugs you, then goes over and carefully mounts Celestia.

"Rose." You hold her hand tightly.

"God's will." She shakes her head. "Only thing I can think of." She then leans up and kisses you.

"By the way, did you stand here the whole time I was gone?" You tilt your head.

"No.. yes.. well, you weren't gone more than a couple of minutes." Mrs. Velvet gave a small shrug.

"Well, either that means I still have 21 days, or I only have 20. I spent almost two days, there. And it seems to be still the afternoon that I left." You mention.



Part XIII: The Preparation

You spent two days manufacturing silver bullets in 9mm, 5.56mm and 7.62mm. Sunset practiced her magic - and found that despite being human, still, she could manage her spells just as easily. Celestia also gave her a crash course in 'forbidden magics' from what she could recall - attack spells, lethal spells. Things even Twilight didn't learn.

Mrs. Velvet helped out with Tulip and Scootaloo - and the two of them were acting like sisters aleady, despite their differences.

Rose helped you directly. She'd been hunting a few times in her youth, but more than that, she wanted to be near you. For some reason, the love you shared was growing. Just being near her, being with her, helping build these seeds of death.

You also taught her how to use your Glock. It's the easiest of all the handguns to master - especially since she made it perfectly clear she was not going to let you take the field of battle alone.

That's just it, though. You weren't alone. Not anymore. You had a team. You, Rose, and Sunset.. and Scootaloo, since she was probably going to tag along even if you told her not to.

You found that Zecora's potion did, in fact, decrease the severity of your nightmares, now that you were here. You had, by your guess, 18 days to find Nightly Whisper.

Celestia and Scootaloo went over the clues she brought back from Ponyville's ruins. Much of it was indecipherable, given that the hidden sigils had been wrecked by the Vortex Spell, but Celestia is certain that many of the fragments were, indeed, control sigils erected by the suspect vampire, to tame the horde and bend them to suspect vampire's will.

Now.. you had to search.

Back to Ponyville you went, this time with Royal orders.

"Alright.. the train will stop each time it comes back through. That's four hours from now." You said, as your team got into a loose formation, spreading out from the station.

"So, the werebeasts were the only thing you couldn't kill?" Sunset asked.

"I probably didn't have Enough Gun to do it by brute force. I don't know - I might have to hit them right at the base of the skull, or something, to bypass their mystical protections. Still, that's a tall order under combat conditions. I'm not a solider, just a recreational shooter." You remind her.

"And my job?" Asked Rose.

"While Sunset and I are killing monsters, you cover Scootaloo while she copies down everything she missed last time. We'll draw their attention, but be alert, one of them might try to sneak up on you two." You direct. "And Sunset, keep that magnum handy, in case you get too tired for magic."

Yes, dear friends, when you made 9mm/.355-inch bullets, you resized them to 9.1/.357 diameter for the revolver. How? Tapped them with a hammer to make them squish a bit, and ran them through a resizing die. Mind, you could have left them at .355-inch diameter and the results would be just fine, but you're a stickler for accuracy, and the bullets are mostly silver, therefore, kinda soft.

Gotta make sure everyone's armed, right? You're using Sombra's Browning, Rose has your Glock, and Sunset has the Smith & Wesson.

You and Sunset moved ahead, and the Monsters drew closer. Some ghouls you didn't kill last time, the werebeasts, and a few Mermen.. and now a couple suits of waking armor, with axes.

"You get the Armor, Sunset. I'll get the squishies." You said, raising the AR-15, and sighting in on your first victim.

"Right.. let's see how they handle some heat.." She grins a little, time to prove herself.

Sunset stretched her right arm out, splaying her fingers, but pointing with her index finger. She shut her eyes for a half-second, and a raybeam of absolute heat shot from her curled palm. When it hit the metal, the metal heated up instantly, and grew yellow-hot in seconds, before bursting apart.

You sight in on the first Werebeast, and tap off two rounds.. two chest hits, and the monster SCREAMS in agony, the Silver causing the monster to DISSOLVE like it was hit with a powerful acid.

They get a brain-wave and rush you.. a whole crowd. Fifteen at once.

Sunset sees this, and rotates her arms in a circle, coming to rest with her arms crossed left atop right, fingers up, then she sweeps her arms uncrossed, and a bubble comes up over you.

"I can only do one thing at a time, Anon!" She reminds you.

"Got it." You crouch slightly, getting a bit more bend in your knees.

From one target to the next, you engage with double-taps, right, left, right, center, left, right, center, center-right, right, left, center, left, far left, far right, bolt locks back, drop rifle on sling, raise Browning, engage final target at near left.

Fast 360 threat-scan, reholster Browning, drop AR mag with a gentle whip, pull a fresh one, slam it home, slap the bolt release like it owes you fiddy dolla.

"Impressive." Sunset says as she sweeps her hands down and lowers the bubble. "Only one of them managed to touch the bubble, even.. you do this a lot?"

"Well, in my world, my buddies and I would set up targets for each other - shoot/no shoot stuff, where you have to engage fast and decide instantly which ones are okay to shoot, and which ones aren't." You shrug. "This reminded me of that, only, my targets didn't have claws." You look over to Rose, and Scootaloo. "How's it going?"

"We're fine, so far." Rose called back.

"There's a lot of stuff I missed. I want to check out the library." Scootaloo nods.

"Alright, come on. I think it's still mostly intact." You gesture, and they go.



Part XIV: The Dance

At the Library, standing guard, is a huge skeleton creature and a demonic gargoyle thing.. pony-fied.

"Welp.. I don't think they're going to let us in." You shrug.

"Geeze.. what the hell are they?!" Sunset scowls.

"Big and ugly." Rose harrumpfs.

"Scoots, you and Rose hang back." You look at Sunset. "You take the skeleton, I'll get the gargoyle."

"Right. I don't expect you'd be able to pick off the bones on that thing if you're trying to dodge it." She shrugs.

"Come on." You steel yourself, and step out.

They don't react much, other than to turn and look at you. Sunset coming up next to you just elicits the same response. They just stare.

"What are they doing?" Sunset asks.

"I think they're trying to decide if we're a threat." You nod. "Jump 'em."

"Just a sec..." Sunset nods.

Sunset then shuts her eyes, and when she opens them, she casts her hand towards the ground, sending out a sheet of ice from her position, to under the monsters' feet.

Taking that as the 'go' signal, you raise your rifle, and start pumping the trigger, sights on the ponyfied gargoyle creature. When it takes to the air, you start firing at the wings, which produces nice burning holes in them - silver works on this thing, too.

The skeleton slips, slides, and falls over, trying to make purchase on the glass-like surface. Sunset raises her arms straight up, hands knifed, and the ice forms solid walls around the skeleton.

The Gargoyle starts shooting fireballs from its mouth. You scamper away like a Welfare Queen from a job application. Rolling on your back, you change magazines again, flop over a log, and pull yourself into a crouch, aiming up at the monster, and firing towards its right wing root.

The skeleton tries to use its arms to crawl out of the box of ice, abandoning the large spear it had carried, only for Sunset to raise one hand and make a fist, creating a large ice block directly above the monster. She then throws her arm down, and the giant ice block slams into the skeleton, shattering and crushing it. She even grinds the thing around a little, making gestures with her fist, the ice box and ice block becoming a mortar and pestle.

The Gargoyle falls to the ground, its wings no longer capable of lift. The beast gets to its feet, and tries to charge at you.  As it lands, you transition back to the Browning, and dump all 11 remaining rounds into its face. Smooth as silk, it produces 11 burning, melting wounds, which causes it to fall back to the ground. For good, this time.

You reload the Browning quickly, slamming the magazine home hard enough to trip the slide release. You step up to it, aim down, and fire another five rounds into and between its eyes, killing it.

"Well! That was something.." Sunset made a 'hmpf' noise, and dusted off her jacket. "..you're right, you DO need me." She gives you a sassy grin, despite sweating bullets, and clearly having expended some energy.

Girl does work!

"Never said I didn't." You say, reloading your rifle again.

The four of you enter Twilight's library, where you'd met up with Father Waddle all those months ago.

"Alright, let's start looking for clues." You didn't have to say it, but..

"Do you think there ARE any?" Sunset put in.

"I'm sure there's something. Twilight was good at keeping notes. That and I'm pretty sure this place wasn't this messy the last time I saw it." You shrug.

"It's worth a shot!" Scootaloo put in, as she started going through everything.

Sunset was more.. emotional about it. Finding a picture of all the girls together, she ran her hand across it, and lowered her head. Rose came up and put a hand on her shoulder, and gave her a smile.

"I never got a chance to show her.." Sunset started.

"You'll be the hero we need, Sunset." Rose reassured her.

"We all will." You state, as you found her diary. "After this, we search Fluttershy's place." You nod.

"Any reason?" Sunset looked up at you.

"She started all this. Her and her obsession with me, with finding my fetish.." You look uncomfortable.

"What.. did she do to you?" Rose asked.

"Whatever she could think of. She wanted sex with me at any cost. At one time, she tried to rape me. Actually, more than once.." You shrug. "It was always something new. Some new hairbrained scheme. She got Twilight or Rarity to cast spells for her.. a couple times, I know she got Discord or someone like him to cast reality-altering spells. A few of those were downright scary." You shook your head.

"I can't imagine Fluttershy doing something like that." Sunset shook her head. "Not the one I knew." She looked between Rose and you.

"That's just it. I think Fluttershy was corrupted, twisted, teased, and strung along until she was willing to take such insane risks that they'd be guaranteed to cause harm. The thing is, though, it'd been a couple months since her last attempt. THAT time, she sent me to a Concentration Camp." You shuddered.

"What's a concentration camp?" Scootaloo asked. "Sounds like summer school.."

"Right, you ponies didn't have that.." You look down. "..about fifty years before I was born, there was a war.. the most horrible war my planet had ever experienced. Over seventy million people died - three percent of the Human race - in just six years. During that war, a nation we fought against had decided that all undesireables and enemies of the state needed to be rounded up and put in these horrible camps. There've been all kinds of accusations about what went on, there, from crazy stories about crematoriums producing different colored smoke depending on who was burnt up, to lamp shades made of human skin.. to denials of this and claims they were slave labor and human storage facilities. Thing is, no matter who's right, millions suffered in them. A few million may have died - the situation became so political that no one can get accurate, trustable numbers.." You feel shame about this whole situation, even though it happened long before your birth.

"WHY?!" Was all Sunset could come up with.

"She fetishized it. She put me in the uniform of one of those people that ran the camps, and herself in the clothes of a prisoner and tried to bait me into..." You feel sick. "...doing all kinds of cruel, dominant, sexual things to her in the context of that situation." You look up at them with disgust in your face. "Once Twilight freed me from there, I yelled at her for two hours about how disgusting that was. I told her that I never wanted to see her again - that I wasn't just done with her games, but that I hated her more than I could possibly put into words. That she was literally as evil as those people were, and worse, for trivializing that event so farcically. I.. I actually slapped her. Several times. None of the girls tried to stop me, once I explained everything.." You hug yourself. "..she went so far over the line, to me, that I couldn't stand to even look at her."

"Oh, dear..." Rose immediately hugged you in support.

You feel hot tears. Yours.

"And yet, I feel like if I'd just let her do whatever she wanted to me, maybe, all these ponies would still be alive." You pick up Spike's overturned bed, and hold it to yourself. "..he was just a kid."

"I have a feeling you're right, Anon." Sunset stated, also looking a bit more than just uncomfortable about this. "That she was used as a tool by someone - I don't think you giving in would have changed a thing." Her eyes burned with determination.

"You really think so?" You tilt your head.

"I'm sure she would have tried this sooner or later. Or maybe something worse. Just to.. spice up.. your relationship." Sunset twitched her mouth. "Whomever was pushing her to do this, they would have suggested it at some point, I'm sure of it." She shrugged. "Fluttershy still went along with it, though - she ignored the dangers. That's on her."

Not absolving her of full blame, but making it clear she was likely incited to it.. it made sense, though, too.

A thorough search was in order..



Part XV: The Truth

Searching the Library came up with some clues. Some very powerful entity had been here at some point in time, and from what you could tell, Celestia and-or Luna had come after the disaster to make sure any forbidden things were removed - the signs the Royals or Guards had left was careful removal of boxes, books, and items. Whomever came after they did? Searched recklessly, leaving messes.

Of note, a lot of things had been left behind. Personal items of Twilight, mainly, but also odds and ends that probably SHOULD have been removed, but weren't, for whatever reason.

Down in the basement, though..

"What's this thing?" You haul a treasure chest from underneath a large couch.

"I've never seen THAT before.." Sunset pursed her lips, and came over. "Be careful, it might have a magic trap on it."

"Damn straight I'm going to be careful." You retort.

"This book over here was practically glowing when I saw it.." Scootaloo started. "Rose and I are looking at it, but I can't make heads or tails of it."

"She's right. I think it's written in another language." Rose shrugged.

"See if you can find a book to translate? Might be one in the upper library, if it's a langauge book." You shrug.

"It's not trapped." Sunset nods.

"Alright, let's see what's inside.." You open it.

Inside is a weighty mace with a spiked ball on top. The spiked ball is rather large, about the size of a softball, with 24 spikes coming out of it. This is a true "morning star" mace, though the mace head is much larger than it would ordinrily be.

You grasp it, and instantly feel warmth radiating up your arm. Picking it up, it feels weightless. A few gentle practice swings, and you decide to slam it home on Twilight's old sofa.. crushing part of it. It seems that, though it's weightless for you, its impact force isn't. As though it weighed probably thirty or more pounds.

"I've never seen anything like THIS before.." Susnet knit her brow with concern. "..what's more, it looks like it was designed for a human, not a pony."

"You know what? I wonder." You shrug. "This reminds me of a weapon that might be used by some kind of holy warrior to hunt monsters."

You heft it.. again, weightless.. your own strength and endurance wouldn't be hindered by its normal mass.. meaning, even though you're not totally ripped, this thing can still deal a lot of damage in your hands.

It also looks like it has legit Christian crosses carved in it. Things that should NOT EXIST in this world at all.

"Really?" Rose got up and came over. "Anon.. these.. crosses.." She points them out, and touches them gently. "Aie! I got a little shock from it. Like static electricity..." She looks up at you. "Anon.. I think this is a Holy Weapon."

"Really, now?" You tilt your head at her, then look to Sunset. "How'd it get HERE?!"

"Don't look at me!" Sunset started. "My best guess? Someone came through the Mirror long before I did - a human - and probably hunted the first vampires that came here." She stopped, and tapped her chin a moment. "Which might explain how vampires got here in the first place!"

"That would assume the human mirror world of this.. is actually the 'real world' and THIS is the 'fantasy.' And that somehow, this is being corrupted." You lowered your head.

"Then.. am I.. real?" Sunset looks down then up at you.

"Everyone's real in both dimensions, Sunset, the deaths of entities here and the not-deaths of the same ones over there.." You look at Rose. "..means the two worlds might be mirror reflections of each other, but they ARE their own worlds, neither one a fake or an illusion.." You say, pacing away. "..and only ONE entity would know the truth."

"I think that's where I make my entrance!" Discord appeared.

His mistake? Doing it within three feet of you. You swing the mace with zero remorse and a HELL of a lot of frustration and anger, and CRACK him over the head so hard, you hear literal THUNDER.

Down he goes, in a heap.

"Sunset? Bind him. Magically." You nod.

And so, she does, using some of the chains found in the room, and a magic spell that Celestia taught her.

When Discord wakes up? He's bound up Shibari-style. Naughty, naughty.

"WHAT IS THIS!?" He demands, only to get the thunderous mace gently pressed under his jaw.

"You tell me everything I want to know, or I'm going to shatter every bone in your body." You look him straight in the eye.

"WHOA! Human.. human.." He shakes his head, looking at Rose, then Sunset.. and back to you. "..different kind of human. You're not like them at all...!"

"Scared, Chaos Beast?" You sneer at him.

"Ah-NO! No, no, no.. ME!? Scared!? Hah-hah.. that's.. that's ridicul-"

You raise the Mace and indicate his groin.

"OKAY! STOP! STOP! YOU SCARE THE CHOCOLATE OUT OF MY MILK, OKAY?!" He sounds screamingly desperate. "That Concentration Camp stuff.. humans in YOUR world are SICK and TERRIFYING.."

"Yeah. We are. Regret bringing me here?" You cock your head, and rest the mace on your shoulder.

"Ho- HOW DID Y- HOW. DID. YOU. KNOW!?" He stammers out.

"I didn't, until just now." You give him a cruel smirk. "Seems THIS human's got enough Chaos in him to confuse you."

"..you do. You do." Discord shakes his head. "I can't.. READ you.." He looks at Sunset and Rose. "I can read them.. I can read other.. other humans.. but, not you."

"Perhaps I'm just that unpredicatable." You shrug. "Out with it."

"This is but one of many worlds. Some can be travelled to, some cannot, and some exist in clusters with others. Eternity is a grand mass of matter-energy bubbles constantly starting, expanding, joining, melding temporarily, and popping into nothingness. Your feeble human brains couldn't comprehend it.." He looks at Scootaloo. "Even yours, kid."

Like she's an exception..? No matter, he continues.

"I have a limited ability to communicate with other versions of myself. Some more than others. But the connection fades and strengthens in random patterns that even I can't predict." He tries to shrug, but fails. "Suffice to say, since Eternity is infinite, everything that could possibly exist, does, somewhere. You're in a TV show, for pity's sake!" He sticks his nose towards you. "Someone is watching you on YouTube RIGHT NOW." Discord looks at the person reading this, his eyes twinkle, and give a knowing wink.

"Seriously? And who were you looking at?" You ask.

"Oh, nothing. But, you know.. I'm not lying." He tries to shrug.

"I don't think you are. Are you saying that.. at some time in the past.. vampires, real ones, came here and a vampie hunter followed them?" You nod your chin up to Discord.

"Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Keep searching Eternity, and you'll eventually find a world where this conversation is identical, except Rick and Morty arrive and take you back to your point of origin because you being here is disrupting something Rick wants to do." He shuts his eyes a moment, then opens them slowly. "Just checking."

"So, what's this?" You heft the mace.

"The Thunder Mace. It was his weapon." Discord nods solemnly. "It's holy, and can destroy those creatures easily. Problem is, you have to get pretty close to use it." He, again, makes a shrug motion, restrained by the chains.

"Ah-huh.. and I'm like, his decendant, or something?" You tilt your head.

"Not even close. It picked you. You were the first one to pick it up that's compatible with its energy." He looked at Rose. "Maybe some day, little flower."

"Enough with the smart-ass." You glare at him. "Where's Nightly Whisper and how do I destroy him?"

Discord grins widely, but you interrupt his reverie by gently lowering the tip of the mace to his tail, and dropping it precisely three inches. He jumps and yelps as a spike stings him.

"AND IS HE THE ONE BEHIND ALL THIS?!" You catch yourself, hefting the mace, and casually aiming it at him.

"Good catch, human!" He grins, but is fanning his tail like one might a stubbed thumb. "He's not here, he's holed up in an ancient manor house north of the village but south of Canterlot. You'll have to search for it, as I don't recall where it is, nor can I see it." He glances to Sunset, then Rose, then you. "And the second query? A fascinating question. You're holding the answer. Any of them."

This, of course, likely means you can shoot him to death, bash his brains in, or use any other weapon at your disposal, if you're smart about it.

"Nightly Whisper cursed you, but he's not the threat." Discord grins a bit.. and you catch his jagged tooth on a spike and pull him closer. "Ah-dun-kno-hoo-ithhh!" He begs, with his tooth caught.

"Works for me." You shrug. "Can I go home after this?" You just look at him.

"Yes, but, come now, human.. you know full well what you mean by that. Home is where the heart is. You'll just have to decide what that's going to be." He titters a bit. "That'll be the fun part, for me. Seeing what you choose."

"I'm just a rat in a cage to you, aren't I?" You heave a sigh.

"Ehhh... you provide entertainment, but I'm not the one writing the show. I'm just as much a puppet as you are, really.. even if I can see the hands that hold my strings." He shrugged with a smirk.

"Good enough." You shrug. "Now. I'll let you go as long as you promise not to fuck with me or anyone else here, ever again." I looked at Sunset. "Neither of us has the patience, and we're Equestria's protectors for the time being."

"Yes.. it's.. not so much fun without the pink one." He looked a bit sad for a moment, then looked up at you. "You have my absolute word. No trouble."

"Can we really trust him?" Rose looked him over a bit.

"Ehhh.. enough." You shrug, and wag the mace in his face. "He knows if he starts anything with the four of us around, we're liable to seriously injure or kill him, rather than submit to any games he wants to play. And at least I'm chaotic enough to disrupt him, just by existing."

"Let him go?" Sunset looked at you.

"Let him go." You nod.


Part XVI: The Manor

Finding the Manor we sought wasn't as hard as you thought it would be - the trail of Ghouls led you almost right to its gates. You've found that the Thunder Mace makes these things evaporate on impact - the problem is getting close. That's easier said than done, given that some of them spit fireballs, jump much better than you, and even throw bones.

However, you also had Sunset. She was fast becoming used to her attack spells. Not just limited to elemental magic, she also had a magic hand spell that could hit things a distance away, or grab them. She had an "energy ball" spell that had no element but exploded like a Claymore Mine.

Rose was proving tough as well. Not only was she a good shot, she could pick up and carry Scoots if she had to - and even throw her. While Scootaloo couldn't fly, she could glide, and she could still CloudWalk.. which came in handy when..

"The gate's shut, and that moat isn't going to let us across." You peer over the edge, seeing the water was at least thirty feet down - that's broken bone territory. "Scoots?"

"Yeah?" She was looking around with those spectacles. "Oh! Hey! I see a switch!" She pointed.

"I was about to ask - think you can glide over there and hit that switch?" You nod to it, taking the moment to get into your backpack and refill your mag pouches.

"Better than that - with all this fog, I can just walk over there." She shrugged. "I _am_ a Pegasus - we can cloud walk!"

"Be careful. Sunset and I have you covered." You state, getting down a bit lower, and leaning in to your rifle.

Scoots hopped from thin fog cloud to thin fog cloud, and crossed the 50-foot chasm. Once on the other side, she carefully snuck over to where the draw bridge control was, and used the machete to cut away a rope locking it in the up position. The drawbridge lowered obediently.

"Sunset." You nodded for her and Rose to go first. As they crossed, you took rear guard.

The four of you stood at the entrance gate.. looking up at the sky, in the darkness of night.

"I never imagined I'd be doing this." Rose said, slipping her hand into yours. "But.. I kinda feel like I can do anything, now."

"Same." Sunset nodded, with a cocky grin.

"Yeah!" Scootaloo stepped up, taking position near Rose. "Now.. Now I -have- a Mom and Dad. And a sister!" She blushed with joy, just a bit.

"And I'm going to make sure it stays that way." You say, affirmatively.

The four of you made your way into the courtyard.. and it's loaded with enemies. 6 actual vampires, 4 werebeasts, 3 pony skeletons, 12 ghouls, and 4 suits of armor. Lovely.

"Sunset. Focus on the armor and the skeletons. Rose, pick off the ghouls. I'll get the fang faces." You nod slowly.

"Right." Rose raised the Glock, and thanks to the Aimpoint, she was quite accurate with it.

"No problem.." Sunset sighed, and charged forwards.

You did likewise, running about a dozen steps, then throwing yourself down on your belly behind a log, and firing on the werecreatures as they spotted the group of you and charged headlong at you. Four, only, so it was little problem to move aim between each one. Three rounds, each, to be sure. Your bolt locks back, and you roll to the side, flick out the magazine, and get a fresh one out.

Just as you're about to get it inserted, one of the Vampires tackles you, and rolls you away from the magazine, and forces your rifle from your hands. With one hand on its throat, you're trying to draw your Browning before more close in.

"ANON!" Rose yelled.

"I GOT IT! Focus on the ghouls!" You say, switching up and savagely kicking and shoving the fanged beast with your free limbs, before grabbing the Thunder Mace, and jabbing it in the side with the pommel.

That shocked it like a Stun Gun on a normal human, making it jump off. You have just enough time to get to your feet, and swing the Thunder Mace to the ground, letting off an electrical blast at the other three Vampires in range, shocking them, stunning them, forcing them to fall over. You let it drop on its strap, and whip the Browning out, planting four rounds into each of the two remaining Vampires.

That gives you room to work, time to work. You get your rifle back, and the dropped mag, reload, and sight in on the first vampire.. then stop, smirk, and sling the rifle in front of you. You pace over to your downed foe, and whip out the mace. As you pass its three other compatriots.. you SHATTER their skulls with thunderous mace impacts.. and as you arrive at the last vampire, you see Rose had finished with the Ghouls, and Sunset was blowing up the last Armor.

So, you pick up the vampire by the neck, and hold the mace head just a bit away from its face.

"Hey. Wake up, fang fuck." You hiss at it.

"Nghah.. AHH! Youuuuuuu!" It hisses right back at you.

"Nightly Whisper - he in there?" You nod towards the Manor.

"YES! And he will be delighted to get his revenge on you, personally!" It bore its fangs at you, then looked over at the mace. "What.. is that?"

"Your death." A cruel smirk crosses your lips.

You flick the VamPony up into the air slightly, slide your hands down on the mace like a baseball bat, and swing with all your might. It hits the VamPony's head perfectly at the base of the spine, and the impact shreds the connection between them...

"It's a long, fly ball deep into left-center field!" You yell.

..the impact sending the head sailing like a baseball, over 300 feet..

"It could be! It might be! IT IS!" You yell out, pumping your fist.

...and through a plate glass window in the Manor's second floor.

"HOME RUN! And the White Sox win the WORLD SERIES!" You bust out laughing.

"ANON!" Rose doubled over with laughter.

"Dad!" Scoots was more hushy-hushy, like you just told a bad dad joke.

"REALLY!?" Sunset laughed, too. "You're TERRIBLE!"

"I know. Everyone knows the White Sox don't have it this year." Rose paced over to you, giving you a slightly coy look.

"Rockies fan?" You ask, given that she had been found in Colorado.

"Nope. Tigers." Rose did kiss you, though.

"Oh, I see how it is." You slide an arm around her. "We get back to Colorado, I'm going to be having bets on those games." You smirk.

"Ch'get a room!" Sunset scolded, playfully.

You didn't know it, but the glass you just defaced was being stared through by a VERY ANGRY Vampire.. he wasn't going to make this easy, at all.

Not only were you entering his domain, you were disrespecting everything he had. Ancient types tend to hate that.


Part XVII: Entering The Manor


"I can feel the evil within." Sunset said in a cocky voice, pacing inside, and flicking a small fireball into her hand, for light.

"We all can." You say, as you pace inwards, tactically.

"Man, this place is CREEPSVILLE!" Scoots hissed.

"No kidding. But, together, we can make it." Rose nodded.

"Kinda funny.. three humans and a pony, saving all of Equestria." You smirk.

"Is it any better than having just that mace and nothing else against all this?" Sunset noted.

"Point." You nod. "At least guns work."

The front hall, as you entered, seemed to suck the light from everything. The route was clear, but it just FELT like it was full of dangers. Yeah, this wouldn't be easy.

Ghouls started to come out of the side rooms, along with other monsters. Not a huge crowd, but enough of them to be troublesome. Lining up shots, between all of you, wasn't an issue at all. And, fortunately, they were obedient enough to die on command.

Sunset used small fireballs to blow out their brains. You used your AR. Rose tapped shots with the custom Glock. Scoots had that machete in her mouth, and used it to cut the legs from a Ghoul that Rose finished off.

Deeper and deeper into the entrance hall, until you reached a grand staircase and a huge ballroom-like area.

There was something above you.

"What the hell is that?!" Sunset said, pointing to the black mass up above you.

"I'm not sure, but I don't think it's friendly!" You say, as its GIGANTIC wings unfurled.

Massive. Fucking. Bat.

"LIGHT'EM UP!" You say, raising your rifle, and pulsing the trigger until the magazine runs dry.

Sunset summoned a huge fireball, and flicked it up towards the flying bat as it careened around the room, and tried to dive down on the four of you. Every time it did, either you or Rose shot it, and it pulled back.

Sunset's fireball missed, and impacted the ceiling.

"Try and get that thing pinned to a corner, so I can hit it!" She directed.

"Gotcha. Rose, aim for the wings." You pointed, changing magazines.

Between the two of you, you backed it into the ceiling corner furthest from you, and Sunset summoned up a HUGE ice spike, and fired it off, impaling the bat and jamming it into the wall. YOU decide to finish it off.. and run over with the Thunder Mace, and pound its skull in with five powerful strokes, shattering bone, and cooking the beast with electricity.

"Man, it stinks like boiling socks!" Scoots scrunched her nose.

"No kidding." Sunset frowned. "But, it's dead." She nodded.

"Second floor, let's go. Big Boy can't be much further away!" You encourage them.

Indeed, Nightly Whisper was not far. He could feel them approach, too, and knew what this feeling meant. Fear. He was being hunted. By someone who could very easily kill him. Given a chance, at least.

He was on edge. Moreso than ever before.

The four of them moved up the second floor hallway. Together, whatever feeble creatures were before them, melted like ice before a flame.

They were learning. This was getting easier for them to do. Scootaloo was even working as an offensive unit, now, zooming through the hallway at a low buzz, slicing legs, and tripping smaller enemies up.

YOU, on the other hand, were getting more comfortable with that mace. Using it to conserve ammo, now, not just as a last resort item. Learning its foibles and tricks.. such as, the fact that it would return to your hand immediately if you willed it so.

And go THROUGH whatever was in its way at about the same velocity at which it was initially tossed. Range? About ten feet. Plenty to make trouble with.

The troubling part was.. who was waiting for you at the end of the hallway.

"..I was really, really hoping you wouldn't come here, Anon..." Came the soft, regretful voice.

"Wh.." Rose blinked. "Who's that!?"

"Fluttershy." You stand and move forward. "Everyone, stay back. This is between me and her." You start walking towards the huge doors leading to Nightly Whisper's chambers.. and she slowly descended from above, with splendid, giant wings.

"I have.. no choice." She looked down at the ground, then up to you, her eyes glowing red.

"I know, Flutters." You shrug. "You can't defy your master." You nod to the doors. "Is he in there?"

"Yes." She nodded.

"He's cursed me. I'm dying." You state flatly. "He wanted to take over." And shrug. "I stopped him."

"I-I know.." She was wringing her forelgs. "..I can hear him.. he's.."

"Commanding you to kill me." You nod to her. "Your heart can't do it. You still love me."

"I! CAN'T!" She falls to the ground writhing.

"I never hated you." You pace over, and kneel next to her. "Annoyed, yes, but never hate. I was.. angry.. but then you died for me." You caress the side of her muzzle.

"ANON!" She screams. "ANON..!" She thrashes. "I.. CAN'T.. HOLD.. HIM BACK!" She starts crying. "PLEASE!" She looks desperately at you.

You? Choose neither murder nor mercy.

Instead.. you wind up.. and swing that Mace at those doors with all your might.


Part XVII: The Big Boss

The walls shatter inwards at sonic speed, making a huge mess. Rubble, rubble everywhere, and you march inwards.

Your team is still hanging back - you don't realize it, but, to save her life and keep her from hurting you, Sunset was casting a Sleep Spell on Fluttershy. So Nightly Whisper can't have her.

No.. you're too damn mad to realize what's going on.

"WHISPER! GET THE FUCK OUT HERE, YOU DOLLAR-STORE DRACULA!" You scream into the darkness.

"How DARE you sully the name of our Eternal Master!" He immediately descends from the darkness, and stands atop his throne.

"Your Eternal Master gets horny at bloody razors." You spit at him, with vile vitriol.

"I see my curse still affects you." He reaches out, and pulls, like a puppetmaster pulling strings..

OH GOD FUCK AND TARTARUS THE FUCKING PAIN! BURNING, SEARING, CLAWING PAAAAAAAAIIIINNN!

Wounds appear all over your body. Quickly. You fall over, still holding the mace. You're no He-Man, no Rambo.. this shit fucking HURTS!

"Heheh.. welcome to eternal torment, Monke-"

"LEAVE HIM THE FUCK ALONE!" Screams Sunset, blindsiding him with a fireball about 15-feet across.

You.. the pain ceases burning so badly.. now your wounds just throb. They hurt, but it's bearable.

Nightly Whisper recovers fast, and staarts charging at her, only for ROSE to throw SCOOTALOO at him, and hit him squaw in da nuts..

..WITH HER FUCKING MACHETE!

*YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!*

He bellow-screams so loud, the walls shake, as his precious kiwis make a wet thwap on the floor.

This gives you enough time to get up, and stagger over to him.

"Fuuuuckkk.. yooooouuuuu!" You drawl out at him.

Thank Celestia the mace is weightless to you. You just start pounding him in the face, over and over again.

He manages to eject a powerful mystic blast of pure darkness.. just before you manage to cave in his skull.

"You.. insolent.. creatures." He wheezes out. "What kind of a battle is this!?"

"Not.. not a battle.. fuck-face.." Sunset groans, getting to her feet. "This is a fucking street fight!"

"I'm going to-"

FLUTTERSHY! OUT OF NOWHERE! DIVE-TACKLING NIGHTLY WHISPER WITH HER BARE HOOVES!

You roll over and manage to get up, just in time to see him savagely rip her neck open down to her chest.

And Sunset manage to get to her .357 Magnum.

And Nightly get up, intending to splatter the Mage.

And Sunset fire all six rounds right into his chest from about 6 feet away.

And then, Nightly, fall over.

"No fucking mistakes." You walk over to him, and magdump into his head.. then dump your last rifle mag into him, then reload your Browning, and are joined by Rose and Sunset, and magdump again.

And just for good measure, you wheel back with that Thunder Mace, and slam it down so hard on what's LEFT of his skull, that it splatters everywhere like Ghallager hitting a Watermellon with his trademark Wooden Hammer.

It's a giant, bloody mess.

After heaving a few breaths.. you realize.. you feel much better.

"Anon!" Sunset points to you. "Your wounds are gone!"

"GUYS!" Scootlaoo was crying.

You rush over to her, cradling Fluttershy.

"Flutters.." You kneel down by her. "..that's two I owe you."

"Y'sh.." She was crying. "..have killed.. me.."

"I can't kill MY friends, either, Fluttershy." You caress her muzzle again. "No matter what that sick fuck wanted me to do."

"Hehh.. h-heroic.. s-sacrifice.. your.. fetish?" She mewled out.

"No.. but.. I'm going to tell you what is." You said, and lean in to whisper it to her, confessing your darkest secret.

"...should've known.." She pecks your cheek with her bloodied lips.

And went still.


Part XVIII: The Fallout

Ten days later, you're back in Pony Canterlot - gotta define which one, since you might be going back to Colorado! - as a guest of Princess Celestia.

She was given a full report of everything that transpired.

"I still feel, Anon, a greater force than Nightly Whisper is out there." She frowned.

"Oh, I agree. But, it's scared, now, whatever it is." You shrug. "So, forget it, okay?"

"For now." She nodded a bit. "I will have much rebuilding to do." She looked down.

"Well.. I've been invited to start a new life as a mild mannered janitor at a public school, after successfully protecting the school from a corrupt superintendent." You shrug at her, seeing Rose enter.

"Oh, indeed, Anon." Celestia smiles a bit. "I think.. you'd fit in well there.. given.." She looked at Sunset, Scootaloo, and Tulip. "..your growing family."

"Who's there!?" You look up, and around the room, seeing a figure standing by the window.

"Anon.. they've returned." She says, reaching out to you. "We need you."

"..I'll start coffee, honey, looks like we're going to have an interesting summer vacation." Rose says, decocking the revolver from under the sheets. "Thank you for telling us, -"
