   "Is this the outfit you wanted me to wear, Anon?" Sunset Shimmer - the prim and proper girl at school - was standing before you in a full-blown Maid outfit.

    You look over your finest accomplishment. After months of planning against her for the humiliations she's caused you.. your victory is nigh. Finally, she would taste the bitter fruits of defeat, and you, the sweet nectar of victory.

    "Yes, Shammy-Wow. It is. Very nice. Now, get your ass in here." You sneer at her.

    Oh, the evidence you have.. the things you could do with it! It was priceless. The utter ruination of her reputation is nothing compared to the jail time she would get. Well, at least, Community Service. More of it. And probably an ankle tracker.

    She stepped into your house, nervous, sniffling a little.. humiliated? Perhaps. Perhaps not nearly enough.
    "Remember.. you.. you promised that you'd tell them I lost a bet." She shoots you a look.

    "I'll keep that promise, so long as you keep yours." You nod at her, with a smirk.

    This weekend was going to be glorious. And to top it all off, you had a guaranteed maid to clean it all up. And people would be watching! More score for you... more or less.

    "After all.. 'losing a bet' is far better than them finding out the alternative.." A dark snicker.

    The look in her eyes is somewhere between terror and utter humiliation. She begs sympathy from you with those eyes.. yours return none in kind.

    "They won't be here for a couple hours. Hop to the kitchen - your jobs are all laid out for you."

    You can barely contain the laughter in your heart.. Revenge is Sweet.

    Honestly, you didn't know half the people that would be attending this. You didn't care. They were here for the spectacle - and you would be rewarded with enough of a boost to your miserable reputation to get them off your ass for.. at least the rest of High School. That's all you needed, really.

    Sunset paced to the kitchen with her head down, her visage one of total defeat. She would be spared the worst of it, but this was still going to sting. Bad. She knew these people. She knew what they were like. Her despair turned to gritty determination to make the ruse come off properly - if she was going to have to play Maid all weekend in order to convince everyone she lost a bet, then she was going to do it so well, no one would question it. That meant.. ugh.. pretending to get along with Anon. Not like friends, but pretending he was higher on the social ladder than he was. That he deserved the best service she could muster. And! And! Since the two rich girls were supposed to be here, along with some other moderately well-off folks.. she hoped to leverage this to an advantage. An actual job as a Maid (take THAT, Anon!) - which beats the hell out of working at a hot dog stand in the mall, and hearing dick jokes all day.

    You pace around the house, making sure everything was perfect. All the breakable things were out of all the rooms already (she wouldn't have had time to do all that - plus, some of it was family heirlooms you wouldn't trust her to touch) and locked up tight in the storage room off of the attached garage. Everything that could be dangerous - spare kitchen knives, Mom's prescriptions, things like that - were likewise locked away. Hey, you were throwing a house party for two days. The LAST thing you needed was someone getting stabbed, dying of an OD, or something liek that.

    Dad's liquor cabinet, however...

    "How's it coming in there, Maid Shimmer?" You address her with a corny upper class accent.

    *Grunt* "Fine. Dork." She snapped at you.

    "What was that?" You have a *tsk-tsk* in your voice.

    "Fine. Master." She tempered her tone a little.

    "Much better, my little maid." You giggle like a loon. This was going to be epic.

    Several hours later, the guests have shown up, with more coming as time passed. Not everyone was invited, of course, but you invited all the right people. The popular ones. The RIGHT crowd. Some, of course, didn't make the guest list.. but your best friend, of course, did..

    "Hey! Derpy! Good to see you." You walked over as she came in, and gave her a half-hug.

    *Giggle* "Thanks!" She beamed. This was partly for her benefit, too. "I don't know why you'd invite me, though."

    "Because. I can't, in good humor, enjoy a bash like this without my best (only) friend!" You give her a beaming grin. "Come on. Let's mingle a little." *Cough* *Whisper* "Besides, I don't really know anyone here." You didn't really invite any of the ones that did the most horrible things to you.. like Gilda..

    "Cool!" She swayed in - actually wearing fitting clothes for the occasion (you were rather shocked she had some).

    "My little maid here.. has prepared excellent punch!" You snap up a mug (styrofoam cup - because fuck the chance they'll break the good crystal ones) and dip into the punch bowl (one of Mom's cheap plastic ones), handing her the cup, and getting one for yourself. "Careful, though, there's liquor in it.." You mumble to her.

    "I'll be careful." She winked. "This isn't my first party." Oh, really? Huh. "I know my limit.."

    Ninety minutes later, however...

    "WOO-HOOO!" screamed Derpy, as she danced on the top of your coffee table. Her outer shirt was long shed, a lampshade planted on her skull, skewed sideways. She danced like a chimpanzee having a bad LSD trip and an epileptic seizure at the same time.

    So much for knowing her limits.

    "You let her get drunk?" Your Maid asks as she delivers drinks on the serving tray to some of the guests.

    "Her choice." You shrug. "I lost track of her after she had a couple cups of punch." And you were busy glad-handing some of the guests. One of them was the captain of the football team.. eh.. what's-his-name.

    "She's done this a couple times before, Anon. You better watch her closely." She warned. Was that genuine concern?

    "Why? She going to get into trouble?" You give Sham-Wow a half-concerned look.

    "Last time? She nearly drowned herself trying to swim." She snorted - a death at the party would, of course, ruin everything. For them both. Ah, so that was it - self-preservation!

    "Gotcha. Once she settles down a little, I'll get her into one of the side rooms and make her sleep it off." A look was given at the drunken dancing diva.

    You had most of the bedrooms upstairs locked - yes, your house was old enough that it had locks on all the doors. And you had one of two sets of keys (the other being hidden in the garage). The Guest Room, however, was wide open - you knew there was going to be sex happening, it was inevitable, so you even provided three boxes of rubbers. There was another two boxes in the basement side room - the main room had the DJ. And your dad was nice enough to have a sound system installed in the entertainment room that she was able to patch into - music everywhere!

    "S'not for your benefit, Anon." She darkly warned.

    *BLUARGH!* Someone puked in the kitchen.

    "Maid." You blink and nod to the kitchen area.

    "Oh, of all th-" She looked over at a couple of the girls, realizing they were watching her. "I'll get it, MASTER Anon!" She put extra emphasis on the 'master' part.

    Good girl. Good little maid.

    Your attention turned to Derpy, and her antics. She was now trying to snort Chee-tos dust off of one of the side tables. And giggling a fit. You moved over to her, and slid an arm around her - time to get her secured.

    Of course, you had a rather warm feeling in your belly yourself. Three cups of punch. For your age, you were able to handle two beers.. drinking wasn't much your thing. But the punch was just so darn good...

    ...speaking of, someone was hogging the punch bowl. She looked completely wasted herself. What was her name? Berry? Whatever.

    "Come on, Derpy." You guide her away from her orange crack snorting competition, and guide her to the stairs. Not that there wasn't a couple already making out there. "Hey, guys, the Guest Room's upstairs." You give a nod - attempting to CONTROL chaos is futile, but you can, at least mitigate and redirect it, to an extent.

    "Ohh.. right. Thanks." The girl said, looking up from her tonsillectomy from the guy next to her. Off they went, and you were right behind.

    "Uhh.. Anon.. I d-do-on't fffeel ssso gooood." Derpy belched a little.. and covered her mouth gently. So, you guided her to the bathroom, first.

    "Just relax. I think you had a little too much." Great. Your best (only) friend was ready to toss it all. Oh, well.. you'd sit there with her and hold her messy hair back while she worshiped Principal Celestia's Porcelain Throne.

    "Yerr.. sshuch a good friend.." She mumbles.

    A couple hours passed before she was better enough to be laid down without risking her drowning in her own vomit. You'd give her the privacy of your own bedroom - you two spent enough hours in there, studying, anyway. So, out of the bathroom you went, key to your room in hand, and you'd unlock the door and guide her in.

    "Relax on my bed, Derpy." You'd give her a bit of a grin - you were prepared for her to spend the night, anyway, and you'd pulled out your sleeping bag and foam mat as it was. She'd slept over before, and slept on them. But now? She deserved a bed.

    And, just to be safe, you dumped out your waste basket (just crumpled paper in there, anyway) and put it beside the bed.

    "Thhannnkss." She slurred. "You're.. awlwlays.. shoo.." She just drifted off.

    Back to the party! You were sure to lock the door behind you. You know, just to make sure no one tried to do anything to her in her compromised state.

    This.. though.. this is where it all started to get a bit out-of-hand.

    "HANDS OFF THE MERCHANDISE!" You heard Shammie shout.

    Down the stairs, and you'd see three guys in the main room with her, trying to crowd her. More than that, there was an increased amount of alcohol in the main room than you remember.. bottles that Dad didn't have.. cheap shit.. and there were guests in here that you knew weren't on the invite list.

    "Hey, hey, hey, guys.." You start in, trying to keep things chill. "She's just here to serve food 'n stuff, and clean up. That's it. Chill." You make placating hand gestures.

    "What's THIS dweeb?" One of them sneers at you.

    Wait.. he's definitely not on the guest list.. he hung around with Gilda. That means she was.. was she here?! Crap.. crap.. that's the last thing you needed.

    "This is my party, and that's my Maid." You gesture to Sunset. "Hands off, okay? I need her to be able to clean UP this mess.."

    *Hyork-hyork-hyork* "Look't this guy, tryin' ta look all big!" The one that sneered at you, pointed at you.

    "I bet he doesn't even lift." Snickered another, as he grabbed Sunset's ass.

    "I SAID HANDS OFF!" She swatted at him.

    "What's the matter, baby, need another drink?" The third one then poured beer down the front of her maid outfit.

    OVER THE LINE!

    "YOU ASSHOLE!" Sunset was livid, her face flushed red with unspeakable rage.

    She slugged him. Hard. Hard enough that he went down. Not that two other guys from the side didn't come up and get him right back on his feet, anyway. There were a few more of them than your drunken mind could immediately process.. this was bad. Very bad. Where did the other guests go? The basement? The music was still pounding down there..

    "GET OUT!" You point to the front door, rage overflowing from your eyes as you screamed in their faces. "GET OUT! YOU WEREN'T INVITED ANYWAY!" Your voice demanded their prompt exit with a strong edge of contempt.

    The liquor in you was giving you courage you didn't warrant.. that your body was in no physical condition to back up. After all, you were a dweeb. There's no real muscle here. Just some decent brains.. brains that were now telling you this whole thing was a VERY BAD IDEA.

    Too late, Brain. WAYY too late to tell you that.

    "SHU'UP!" The second one got right up in your face. The sneer on his lips spoke of equal hatred. For you.

    "Get. Out. Of. My. House. Asshole." You stated in no uncertain terms.

    The next thing you felt was pain. Searing pain in the face. And blackness. Not silence, though, just blackness.

    You could hear Sunset screaming. You could hear other guys laughing. You could hear a crowd start to gather. You could hear them chanting, but you couldn't make out the words.

    You didn't initially realize it, but you'd just put Sunset Shimmer in a position that every person dreads like the grip of death itself. She was going to be gang-raped unless you did something.

    But your body.. it couldn't respond.. you were telling it to get up.. you were envisioning the things Dad had carefully stashed away for when Duh Gubbamint comes. You were seeing yourself with Ol' Painless mowing them down like jungle foliage. Just.. none of it was real.

    None of it was real but Sunset's screaming.. rage.. and fear.. and more.

    "Get up." You hear in your ear. "GET UP, ANON!" It's not a voice you immediately recognize. "You flip-flop.. GET UP."

    Forcing yourself to your feet, you stagger a little, feeling firm hands on your shoulders. Your brain was almost totally offline.. your vision was still blurred. Finally, you manage to shake off the stars long enough for you to realize that your saviour was none other than the bully you most feared.

    Gilda.

    Was Hell frozen over? Was this the final sign of the Apocalypse?

    "G-Gildaah..?" You slur out. That was mostly the head injury talking.

    "Shut UP, Dweeb king." She stated, as she forced you to stand steady. "And watch my damn back." She snorted as she turned her attention to the others. "HEY! HEY! YOU ASSHOLES!" She yelled at the top of her lungs. "GEDDOFFA HER!" And into the fray she leapt.

    Gilda was an accomplished brawler. You knew this. You DIDN'T know that she was THIS good. She started laying out would-be rapists like they were rag dolls. One of them landed at your dumbstruck feet. And you knew what must be done..

    You grab for the nearest hard object you could find.. a folded card chair.. and recall your many nights wasted watching WWE. It was time for foreign objects. And you would honor your wrestling heroes the only way you could.

    By cracking skulls.

    Gilda wasn't kidding when she said she needed help watching her back. Once she got into the fray, you realized that there were at least twelve of them, and two of you. They rather quickly swamped her - despite her skill - and two of them had an arm, another had one of her legs.

    You sobered up quick enough to drill the one that had her leg right in the side of the head, then bash one of the two that had her arm, over the crown of his skull. The side of the chair was used against the arm of the last one that was trying to restrain Gilda.. you felt it hit, but you were unaware of how far adrenaline was pushing you. You nearly broke it.

    That gave Gilda enough room to get at the four that were holding Sunset down on the ground. She kicked the one on top of her in the head, and sprawled him out on the ground. You can HEAR her boots STOMP down HARD on the ground, and an extremely high-pitched scream follow that, but you don't mentally process the epic nut-shot that just transpired, as you were a bit busy. Gilda threw the next one towards you..

    ..and you backed her ass up by slamming the flat of the chair in the guy's face, breaking his nose..

    ..and took the third guy from behind, putting him in a perfect Rear Naked Choke, and wrenching him off of Sunset.

    That gave Sunset room to drill the last guy in the nose with her knee, and kick him in the chin. A tooth - or part of one - flew out and hit the carpet somewhere.

    "GET THE FUCK OUT BEFORE I FUCKING BEAT YOUR FACES SOME MORE!" Gilda screamed at the top of her lungs.

    "You'll regret this, bitch.." The one that had sneered at you before said, as he picked himself up off the ground. "..you already lost the gang. You're fuckin' DEAD now!" He pointed at her.. then at you. "YOU'RE DEAD, too, you little zit!"

    The rest of them picked themselves up off the ground.. and started staggering towards the door.

    "GET OUT!" You scream, holding the partially destroyed chair up like Mjollnir.

    They departed, and only then did you realize that you were being watched by most of the partygoers. They'd come out of the basement.. and were watching the spectacle the whole time.

    So, you turn to them.

    "You, too. Assholes. GET OUT! PARTY'S OVER!" You don't need to threaten THEM with the chair - they're good kids, even if they are elitist jerks.

    Jerks that didn't bother to help.

    The jerks all file out in short order. Leaving you alone with Gilda, Sunset.. and Derpy, sleeping it off in your room.

    All you can do is collapse on your couch.

    "Thanks.. Gilda.." You look at your hands.. there's blood on them, and it's not yours. "..but, why?"

    *Coldly* "No one deserves that." She stated as she helped Sunset up and into a chair.

    "God.. DAMN IT.." Sunset yelled, holding herself. Her breasts were bare (they're much smaller than they looked in the maid outfit), the dress part was torn in half.. and you're pretty sure that's her panties on the floor, and one of her high heels.

    "Did.. they..?" You daren't ask that full question. It was all your fault.

    "N-No. He didn't get in.. with that.. but.." She teared up. "..I need a fucking shower."

    "Go ahead and use my mom and dad's.." You pull out the key from your pocket and pass it to her. "I'm.. I'm sorry, Sunset.. I.." You want to curl up and die, as the gravity of what you exposed her to, comes to your mind like a jackhammer.

    "...thanks." She took the key and made a hasty exit for the upstairs.

    "You played with fire, dweeb.." Gilda admonished you. "..a house party? With booze? And a maid? What'd you think was gonna happen!?"

    "I FEEL BAD ENOUGH, OKAY!?" You yell back, actually showing Gilda you had a set of balls. For once. "I just invited the cool and popular kids. I didn't think you'd show up with your crew.." You throw your hands, and curl up on the couch, hugging your knees.

    "They ain't my crew anymore, Dweeb King." She looked away, her voice was cold again. "And they're not kidding about killing us."

    Wait.. what?

    "What!?" This hit you like a ton of bricks. "The hell's going on!?" You demand. "What do you mean they're going to kill us?!"

    "Just what I said, Dweeb!" She snorted. "You got no idea what the hell goes on at that school, DO you?!"

    "Other than you shoving me into lockers and dumping me into trash cans with your girlfriend-"

    "EX-Girlfriend." She spat.

    Another thing you didn't know.

    "When'd you break up with her?" You cock an eyebrow.

    "Couple weeks ago.. it was pretty bad.. not that it's any of your business." Another snort, and she walked to the kitchen and came back with a large tote bag. She fished a pack of cigarettes out of it, and lit up. "You want one?" She offered. Saddle Arabians. Your preferred brand.

    "Thanks." You snatched one and accepted her lighter, lighting the cancer stick, you returned it. "Now what's this about you not running your own crew?"

    She stood up and showed the back of her leather jacket off. Sure enough, The Griffons patch was missing. It looked like it had been cut off. Poorly. There were some gouges around the edges.

    "This flip-flop dickhead named Scorpan challenged me. He won." She sat down immediately, and hugged herself. "They kicked me out. Told me if I ever tried any shit with them again, they'd kill me. Not that they didn't do plenty.."

    "They.." You blinked. "..they did things to you." You knew what 'things' this entailed. And why she said 'no one deserves that.' Also, the name Scorpan sounded familiar - you remember he got expelled for trying to fillet some kid with a knife. Got some Community Service for that, too.

    "A-fuckin'-Plus, Dweeb King." She snarled.

    "We gotta go to the cops.. something.." You shrug, a bit helplessly.

    *Snort* "I ain't even gonna laugh at that. You really think the cops are gonna do shit? In a town like this? They ain't got shit to deal with Scorpan and the Griffons.. and the other guys he's mixed up with." She narrowed her eyes at you.

    "Then what are we gonna do?! Just sit here and wait for them to come back and finish us off?!" You yell, and flap your arms in frustration.

    "Nope." She dragged on the cigarette, and blew the smoke through her nostrils. "I gotta plan, Dweeb King. Gotta say, though, I didn't expect you to be half-a-badass like that.. maybe we gotta shot?" She shrugged.

    "What's the plan, Mastermind?" You narrow your eyes at her.

    "Simple. We talk to Scorpan's boss." She shrugged. "Don't worry. I got somethin' that'll get him to back off. Sorta. See, Scorpan fucked up something his boss wanted him to handle - getting me kicked out of the Griffons was part of his cover-up. But I got it all on my cell." She held it up. "Drug deal. Big stuff. At the time, I didn't know Scorpan was aiming to take over. I show this to his boss, his boss'll kill him for us."

    "WHAT?!" You practically jump out of your seat. "You want me to HELP you with a DRUG DEAL!?" You sink back in the couch.

    "Not what I said, Dweeb King, pay-a-fucking-tention!" She snarled again. "I don't get into big time drug shit. I just deal a little pot an' some pills, maybe, at a party. You know, just like this one?" She gestured to the overturned punch bowl. "Scorpan wanted all of us dealing. Big time stuff, too. Shit that'll get you a couple decades." In jail, she means.

    "Uh-huh.." You followed so far.

    "Before Scorpan took over - he'd been working for some other guy the whole time, which I didn't know - he was supposed to make this big deal for a shitload of Heroin. He fucked it up, nearly killed the dudes that were there to make the deal, and lost the drugs and the money. He blamed it on me. When he kicked me outta the Griffons, he said he was doin' me a favor - coverin' my ass. I guess his boss bought it, I'm still breathin'." Gilda explained, using her fingers to make sure you pay full attention.

    "You know where the drugs or the cash are?" You tilt your head.

    "Nope. I think Scorpan hid them until the heat's off.. he'll probably keep the cash and deal the drugs. The guys that were bringin' it in? He dumped them somewhere good - then said I scared them off or something, and he took over and kicked me out as punishment. I dunno what happened between Scorpan's boss and the Suppliers, though, how that got smoothed over.." She shrugged.

    "What happened to the dealers?" You shrugged. "Where'd he dump 'em? Were they still alive? What?"

    "They probably died. I dunno. All I know for sure is that two of the three got shot, and they were still breathing when I was done recording. The third one booked it with the drugs and the cash, Scorpan and some others chased 'em. When I confronted him, he said he got rid'a them somewhere good - if he got the drugs and the cash, he's got three bodies on him. If he didn't, the dude that got away probably bitched out and ran for it. The guys they were dealing with are the kind that kill you for fuckups. You know.. chop off your fuckin' hands and shit." Gilda finished her cigarette and snuffed it in an ashtray.

    "Well.. fuck.." You shrug. "You got proof, though."

    "Yep." She nodded. "I take it to his boss, clear my name, get you protection.. we're fuckin' set, Dweeb King." She smirked.

    Sunset came down the stairs about then. She was dressed in one of your shirts - that one with the printed "tuxedo" pattern on it - and a pair of your jeans (the black ones, of course, your only good pair) with one of your belts. And your extra pair of shoes. It still looked vaguely like a maid's outfit.

    "I stole your clothes. Your girlfriend's still passed out on your bed." She shrugged. "Woke up long enough to let me in, though."

    "She's not my girlfriend.. she's more.. like a sister." You shrug.

    "They're probably gonna kill you, too, Mustard Head." She snorted at Sunset. "After they're done with you."

    "MUSTARD HEAD?!" She shrieked. "Wait-What?"

    Gilda sighed long and frustrated.. then explained everything. She made sure to go into gory detail, this time, about what her former gang did to her when Scorpan dethroned her. How they violated her. Then came back a couple weeks later and took bats to her stomach to make sure she didn't have a kid from it and try to take them to court or something.

    She also explained that all this had happened over the last two months since Spring Break. It was June 6th, school was just barely out, and you were looking forward to summer before your Junior year.

    Gilda was a Senior, but she'd be repeating part of the year for various incidents that caused her to fail a couple classes. Sunset and Derpy were going to be Juniors, just like you.

    "This is all fucked up." She slammed her ass into the sofa right next to you. "Yo.. Anon.. you know, you didn't have to.." She looked at you, and looked down. "I shouldn't have opened my damn mouth.." She mumbled.

    "What? An' let all'a them have at you?!" Gilda yelled. "That's what was gonna happen, ya know!"

    "I just.. I don't know! And now we have to deal with a guy that KILLS people!?" She threw her hands up. "What the HELL?! WHY IS MY LIFE LIKE THIS?!" Oh, gee, maybe it's because of all that SHIT she tried to do before? Karma? No, Karma isn't this cruel.

    "How long do we got before they come back and try to kill us?" You ask Gilda. Your expert over here.

    "Not much longer." She shrugged. "Scorpan doesn't let his guys call him on his cell - not those bastards, anyway. They'd have to go see him in person, and he stays at, like, a couple different places. Once they got him, tell him - maybe they gotta sober him up a little, first - he'll tear ass down here to fuck me up himself."

    "We need to get out of here." You sigh. "We need a car." YOU don't have a license.. your parents did promise to get you your license over the summer, though, if your year-end grades were good. The report card wasn't due for a few days, though.

    Gilda looked over at Sunset. "She's got a car."

    "NO WAY! Not my baby. I NEED her!" She protested. "That car is the most important thing in my life, right now! I have to get to WORK, I have to get to SCHOOL.. okay, not school any more.. but I have to get to my Community Service in that, too! Buses don't run out that far!"

    "We gotta get OUT of here, Sunset." You state, the booze burnt off in a haze of slowly-seeping-in pain and drained adrenaline. "I'll go get Derpy.. I don't want to leave her here."

    *Whining sigh* "I parked it out back." She got up. "Come on.." She nodded to Gilda and they went for the back door.

    You went up the stairs to the second floor, and over to your room. Unlocking the door and stepping in, you'd find Derpy going over something in one of your strategy guides, awake, but not alert.

    "Hhhey.. Anon.. did you know that Ezio can-"

    "No time, Derps. I fucked up. I fucked up big time." You pick her up off the ground. "There's guys after me, and they're going to kill us." You give her the most serious look you can muster.

    "Hah.. hah-hah.." She giggled. "That's funny. That's real funny. Life isn't a video game, Anon!"

    "WHERE THE FUCK IS THAT FUCKING BITCH!?" You hear your front door get kicked down - or kicked apart, you can't tell - and some deep, baritone voice screaming to the heavens.

    "As you can see, I'm not joking." You wanted to piss yourself.

    "Holy Muffins, Anon! What the hell did you do!?" She grabbed you back and shook you. Mind you, she's 5'2" and maybe 98lbs soaking wet.

    "No time.." How the hell were you going to get out of the house?! You had, maybe, seconds to..

    You grab your backpack, and Derpy, and rush for your bedroom window. Using the backpack as a battering ram, you break out the window frame, and land on the roof.

    The window didn't open, and it was way too small to fit through, anyway. Also, fuck, that hurt a lot.

    "ANON!" Yelled Derpy, as she rolled partly away from you.

    You manage to grab her hand, and pull her back on the roof all the way. Getting her up, you low-run around the side of the house, on the roof - you hear that voice scream for someone to check upstairs - and get around to the back.

    Sunset's car is waiting for you. All you have to do is get down, across your yard, through the neighbor's yard...

    "Down we go!"

    You throw your backpack over your shoulder, and grab Derpy by her wrists, lowering her off the edge of the roof.

    "What about you!?" She looks up at you, worried.

    "Doin' somethin' stupid. GET TO THE CAR!" You implore her.

    It was, indeed, high time for stupidity. The only thing that could really break your fall out here, was your trampoline. And you'd seen enough YouTube videos to know this was a very bad idea, at best. But, with Derpy running for Sunset's car, you step back to get some running distance, and bolt off the edge of the roof in a - surprisingly - well-timed jump, landing on the trampoline almost perfectly square.

    The bounce, however, was not exactly all that well planned out. You get some serious air, hear the trampoline snap, and have just enough time to tuck yourself into a ball before you land. That made you roll, and you were sure everything was broken in all your bones - you managed to land on your shoulder. Still, you got up, and realized you'd cleared most of the yard with that.

    "THERE'S THE LITTLE ZIT!" Screamed one of the Griffons as he bashed open your house's back door.

    "SHIT-SHIT-SHIT-SHIT-SHIT-SHIT!" You pump out, methodically, as each step hits the ground.

    RUN-RUN-RUN-RUN-RUN-RUN!

    You clear the fence separating your yard from your neighbors, land square on your feet, and bolt for the side passageway that ran between their front and back yards. You can hear the yahoos behind you, screaming for blood.

    Getting to the front yard, you see Sunset's car - a damn nice car - and everyone already in it. The back window, thankfully, was down. So, you dive in, head first.

    "THEY'RE RIGHTFUCKIGNBEHINDMEJUSTFUCKING DRIIIIIIIIIIVE!" You stammer-scream out as your diaphragm is compressed against the open window of the car.

    The car peels out.. and you swear you can feel yourself flying. Thankfully, Derpy has a hold of you, real good.

    A few hours and a hundred miles later, you were all sure you'd put enough distance between you and The Griffons, for now. You were also all exhausted - Sunset had to let Gilda drive her little baby because she was getting highway hypnosis real bad. You still hadn't properly slept it all off, and Derpy was somewhat hung over and just wanted to sleep.

    Gilda had the bright fucking idea to stop somewhere to sleep. So, to that end, she turned off at the first sign that showed a rest area. And guess what? It went out of business during the Recession. The place was abandoned.

    "At least we don't have to worry about a vacancy.." She snorted as she parked the car behind one of the buildings. "..goddamn, I want to get baked right now.." She got out, and stretched her limbs, pulling her tote out and walking towards the buildings.

    These buildings were the Main Office and the rental cabins. It was an old-fashioned road stop, at one time, offering full service to weary travelers. Then it became a sort of highway-linked no-tell motel. Now, it was all gathering dust. Gilda went for the main office and got in through a partly-opened window - the Realtor's lock box with the main building's keys were on the door. She soon emerged with a set of keys for one of the cabins.

    "Lucky us.. looks like they only changed the locks on the main building." She said as the rest of you got out of the car.

    "We're going to need gas, soon." Sunset frowned. "Or we're walking. Where the hell are we going, anyway?"

    "San Diego." Gilda smirked.

    "Shit." You blinked. California? That was.. a very bad place.

    Gilda ignored this and went for the cabin, unlocking it, and gesturing you all to get inside. You did, and found the cabin had exactly one bed, a couch, and an easy chair. Well, fuck.

    "Hoo.." Gilda plopped down on the couch, and looked at the ancient TV set. "..wonder if the power's still on?" She flicked the TV on, and on it came.

    "How..?" You shook your head. Shouldn't it be off?

    "Simple, Dweeb King. Realtors have to have electricity on in order to show these places off, or get them cleaned up for selling. Water's probably on, too, and if it's an electric water heater, we got hot water." A wry smirk. "I've spent some nights in.. places." She shook her head a little and dug into her bag, coming out with a baggie and some rolling papers. "I'm going to get so baked, cookies'll be jealous."

    "Isn't that a real bad idea? We ARE being CHASED by PSYCHOPATHS that want to RAPE and KILL us!" Sunset pointed out.

    "So?" She rolled up a nice one, licking the paper delicately. "We're off the highway, the car's hidden, this cabin's set back from the others, even if they knew where we were going, they ain't gonna find us for SHIT. Trust me. I know what I'm doing." She put the joint to her lips. "Besides, we need to chill the fuck out. This is the best fuckin' way." And lit up.

    That's some bomb-ass pot, Gilda. No, seriously, after a little encouragement (and pointing out you might be dead soon and thus would not have another chance at this), you were toking up with the rest of them. Derpy seemed to know what to do with this, and rolled her own. Sunset.. just sat there. Given the small room, it wasn't long before she was getting JUST as high as you all were..

    "Duuudee.." You giggle. Your mind wanted you to act out a typical stoner, but all you could get out was that first word before the whole thing became so hilarious that you couldn't hold yourself together. You started chucking.. then laughing.. at your mind's own silly ideas.

    "Hee-*HIC*-Hee!" Derpy tilted back and forth on her ass, in the middle of the floor.

    "You're.. all.. idiots.." Sunset managed to get out.. her eyelids were being lazy as fuck, fluttering open and shut.

    "Fuckin' chill, Hot Dog Head." Gilda lazily droned out. "Fuck this, I'm gonna go take a hot shower. I hope." She got up and started stripping in front of everyone.

    "Have some DECENCY!" Sunset 'harrumpfed' at her.

    "Dude.. Gilda.. you got a really sweet ass. And tits." You drawl out, looking at the hardened girl in all her naked glory.

    "Thanks, Dweeb King." She swayed her hips side-to-side a little, shaking her ass. "I think I'm fuck'n hot, too." She looked at Sunset, and blew her a kiss. "You ought'a take a ride some time, fireball. Dash never complained."

    "She DUMPED your ass, is what she did!" She crossed her arms, and lowered her head, trying to keep her mind straight in the haze of pot smoke.

    "Yeah, nah, wasn't cuz I ain' fuck'n awesome in bed, though." She leaned over and slowly swayed her tits in Sunset's face. "You know you want this."

    "IknowIwantThis.." You drone out, not realizing what kind of a tent you were popping in your pants.

    "Sorry, Dweeb King. I don't do guys." She shrugged. "You know why." Oh, yeah, the gang rape. "You, on the other hand.." She turned back to Sunset. "..I like a girl that's got a nice right hook." And rubbed the side of her face with her hand.

    "Ew." She gently pushed Gilda off. "No. Not interested." She frowned.

    "Suit yourself." She flicked her tongue at her, showing off her tongue piercing, before going into the bathroom. You can hear her fiddle with the faucets.. and.. "Bingo! Hot fuck'n water.."

    "Hee.. Anon.." Derpy stopped looking at the TV (it has a convertor box and was broadcasting a local channel... in Spanish) and over to you. "..you got a BO-NER..!" She pointed at you.

    "Oohhh.. wow.. hey there, lil' guy.." You become absolutely fascinated by the fact that you have a hard-on.

    "So immature." Sunset laid back on the bed, and tried to pretend nothing was happening.

    "Ya'know.. Sunny.." Derpy started.

    "Don't call me Sunny, Fish-Eyes." She retorted, tiredly.

    "Ya should'a took'n up Gilda on her offer.. you, like, really need to get laid." She lolled back, head resting on the sofa.

    "You were so hot in that maid outfit.." You hear yourself say. "..if I wasn't, like.. thinking about revenge.. I would'a.. you know.. made a pass at'c'ha or somethin'.." You didn't even know where you were going with that. Casanova, you are not.

    "D-Don't remind me of that!" She stammered. "And I do JUST fine, thank you, fish-head." She snorted at Derpy.

    Your twice-baked potato brain then put together that she was blushing.

    "What.. you LIKED the maid outfit?" Your head was swimming in the haze, but damn if you didn't have a hold of some small part of it.

    "N-No! It was humiliating! Degrading!" She blushed harder.

    "She was TURNED ON!" Derpy announced.

    "You were, eh?" You get up, wanting some water from the kitchenette sink.

    "I-I WAS NOT!" She crossed her arms and sat up, almost hugging herself. "I prefer being in control! Someone.. being.. controlling me is.. just.."

    "It maaakes you hoorny!" Derpy rolled out of her mouth.

    "Does NOT!" She shot back. "And being under HIS CONTROL!? Calling him MASTER!? NO!" She pointed at you.

    "You.." Derpy leaned into her hands. "..wanted it to be JUSSST.. you two.. all weekend.." She winked her lazy eye at Sunset.

    "N-NO! Impossible! Never!" She crossed her arms again. "I-I like.. being in control!"

    "Liar." Derpy got up and managed to get over to Sunset without falling over. "You want Anon to totally dominate you in.. like.. every way.." She leaned in.

    "EW! NO! Getaway.." She pushed her a little, and stood up to get away from her.. bumping right into you, and having to turn and look you in the eyes.

    Her cheeks are flushed, she's totally uncomfortable.. humiliated at being called out like this by a loser like Derpy.. in front of you.. she's also staring into your eyes. Time seems to stop as you look back into them, the haze of the pot granting you a moment's inspiration.

    You kiss her. Not just kiss her, but wrap your arms around her, and pull her in. She fights - you would've stopped if she seriously resisted - but stops after a moment, and lets you kiss her. Slide your hands up over her ass.. her firm, plump ass.. and she lets out a small moan as you grasp it.

    "Knew it." Derpy said, sitting on the edge of the bed, near the head of it, lazily looking at you two.

    "A-Anon.." She looked up at you.. her eyes going wild with emotions.

    Maybe it was the pot talking, maybe it was the booze from earlier sneaking back to hit you.. but you pulled her back into you, the moment she started to pull a bit away.

    "What's that?" You remind her, leaning your head back in.

    "M-Mas..ter.." She blinks, looking up at you.. and suddenly knowing exactly what to do.

    Down she went.. slowly.. to her knees. Some part of her was fighting with herself to stop, but at this moment, between the pot and the couple cups of punch she snuck throughout the night to help her DEAL with this shit.. she knew where she wanted her place to be. She wanted to give UP that control she so sought, and give IN to someone even MORE dweeby and humiliatingly low than her arch-nemesis..

    ..the fact that she gently undid your belt and opened your jeans told you enough, though. She stared at the snake that came out of it - you had boxers on - and looked back up at you.

    "Do it." You bid her. "My little Maid.." And gently rest your hand on her head.

    She opened her mouth, gently sliding it over your rock-hard member, and let out a gentle breath as she did so. You can feel her warm tongue as it slides along your shaft.. her soft lips as they wrap around the thickness.. the motion of her head as it moves back and forth.. those eyes looking up at you, wondering.. was it good enough?

    Watching Sunset Shimmer totally debase herself by giving you.. h-ho-ho-mygawd this is incredible.. the most amazing blowjob you ever even imagined getting.. just made you harder. Your dick could BREAK diamonds, right now. You were lost in your own little world.. watching her eyes, nodding to them.. telling them to keep going..

    Sunset's hands came up and gently caressed your sack. Massaging it. One hand grasped the base of your shaft and started counter-stroking it to the rhythm of her lips and tongue.. she pulled out all the way.. and licked it up.. base to tip.. before going back down over it.. those eyes still looking at you.. as her head began moving faster.. her hands finding synch..

    "Ughhgawd.. yes.. yes.." The sensations were indescribable. For losing your virginity (so much for the Wizard Card!), this was probably the most intense experience you'd ever had.

    *MMmhh* She moaned, letting the sonic vibrations travel down your shaft.

    "Mmhh." Your brain was on sensory overload.. but it desired something.. more. You slide your hands down, having to bend over a bit, and guide her to her feet.

    "W-What..? M-Master.." She stammers, softly.

    Your hands slide down, and grasp the edge of her shirt.. and slide it up over her head, pulling it off, your eyes locked together.

     Those hands of hers return the favor.. and while you don't have a toned ottermode torso, you're not exactly fat, either. It's enough that she trails a hand from your upper chest to your waist line. She disengages what's left of your pants over your ass, and your boxers all the way down.. she knows what you want, and a GOOD Maid doesn't allow her Master to do any of the work himself.

    What surprised you was seeing her pants slide down her body without her hands doing it.

    "D-Derpy..?" Your voice croaks out.

    "C'Mon, Anon.." She gets Sunset's panties down, and forces her to spread her legs, showing you that she was already soaking wet.

    "I.. I'm not letting her.. take that.. alone?" Derpy's baked bean brain didn't know the words to use.

    "She.. really likes you.." Sunset got the picture, though. Not that two low-born dweebs using her body like this wasn't making her even MORE horny..

    "You're like a-"

    "Shh." Derpy puts a finger to your lips. "I don't mind you.. you know.." She KISSED you. "..but I don't want to lose my only chance.." She pressed Sunset between the three of you. "..to show you how I really feel."

    Threeway? THREEWAY?! Hell hath surely frozen over.

    Derpy pulled Sunset down onto the bed, and made her spread her legs. She used her own legs to get Sunset's legs up, knees bent, while she wormed her way out of her own pants (black yoga pant-like-things but thicker [fuck if you know what it's called], and a black shirt - her overshirt had been grey) and undies.

    "Come on, Anon.. make her scream." Derpy enticed you.

    You obliged. You got down over Sunset, while Derpy massaged her breasts, and plunged Anon Jr. deep into her pink hole. While it had been roughly treated before, you were giving it exactly what it had been craving. It only made it that much more erotic that the girl that just about told you that she loves you, was HELPING you 'violate' such a girl like Sunset. No, you were dominating her - rather gently, but still - and she was eating it up.

    You pounded Sunset's tight (dear GOD it's tight) hole like it was your obsession.. your only reason to be alive.. and she slid her hands up around your torso, begging for more, while Derpy nibbled along her neck, and used her fingers to tease her nipples..

    Magical? You have no idea.

    Sunset's body reacted to being.. dominated like this.. as though it had been craving this sort of thing all her life. And in a way, it had. She soaked the sheets in no time.. her head was lolled back over Derpy's shoulder, absolute putty in her hands.. and with Anon atop her, drilling her hole.. TAKING her.. she came. Twice. Hard.. her walls spasming around your cock as her whole body tensed up.. digging her fingers into your back..

    "GHHOH-YES! M-MASTER!" *AGHN!* *hhnnnhhh* That second one, though.. that did make her scream.

    Ah, but you weren't done. Nope. It was the pot talking. That and Derpy's seductive stare as she held Sunset in place for the two of you to use as your toy.. you knew the only acceptable place for you virgin seed, and out you pulled.. gently pushing a totally spent Sunset off to the side..

    "A-Anon?" Derpy questioned. She didn't mind getting dirty with Sunset.. but.. she didn't really expect- "OHHhhhhhhhhhhhh!" She squealed as Anon Jr. found her tight, virginal hole. And pounded it. "Ahh.. Ah-non.. AHHHH!" She squealed, much louder and more vocal than Sunset had been.

    Your best.. and only.. friend. And right now, you wanted to feel everything about her. Hungrily, your lips wrapped over hers, your hands snaking up her body, groping her, before sliding down and pulling her hips into you.

    You didn't realize that Sunset's inner sub was still kicking in.. and she now returned the favor Derpy had done her, by worming her way up underneath the two of you, partially, and massaging her nipple with one hand.. while the other worked to pull her nertherlips aside even farther, and work over her clit, her mouth gently biting any flesh along her neck that you weren't already kissing and nibbling on.

    "AH-AH! AH-H-H-FUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKKKK!" She screamed at the top of her lungs. Dear GOD did she let go.. you could feel your cock get absolutely flooded with her juices..

    ..which of course..

    *HGNGHHHnnn* ...made you cum like a fire hose.

    The three of you basically passed out right after that. You weren't even aware that Gilda had to come look once she heard screaming, saw what was happening, went back to the shower, handled her own business, came back out (naked), and passed out on the couch with only a towel from her tote to cover her shame.

    You awoke first, the next morning, swearing the whole thing was just a dream. But when you looked at the naked Derpy curled up in your arms, felt the equally naked Sunset behind you, and saw the also equally naked Gilda on the couch.. well.. all you could do was smile.

    No matter what torture Junior Year might bring as a result of the failed party, at least you had something they'd never have. Even if you never were able to tell a soul what transpired here.

    Provided you lived long enough.

    Your inner reflection was cast away when Gilda rolled over and gave you a smirk and a thumb's up. Okay, she could possibly turn into a complete Lez-Bro. Some day. If she didn't kill you herself. She sat up, and dug into her tote for her cigarettes.

    Dear God you want one so bad, but you daren't move, lest the two sleeping beauties be disturbed.

    Gilda caught your puppy eyes, and leaned over, letting you get a good drag off of hers every now and then.

    Derpy was the next to wake up. She rolled over, into your chest, realized it was your chest, and woke up half freaked out.

    "AH!" She sat up, and had to put a leg out to stop herself from falling out of the bed. "Ah.. Anon..? Did.. we.. uh...."

    "We did." You pull her down and kiss her. On the lips. "And yeah, I kinda.. feel the same way." And hug her.

    *Giggle* "Sheesh. I never knew I was such a freak." She blushed a little.

    "You tell NO ONE." You hear from over your shoulder. "Or I'll cry rape." But she did seductively caress your nipple a little. "..but I'll admit that was the fucking hottest thing.."

    "I'm hungry." You announce, suddenly.

    Breakfast was at a Gas Station - whatever they had. Sandwiches, beef jerky, Slim Jims, coffee, soda, chips.. you all had hella munchies and, on top of that, had all basically skipped dinner. Gilda paid. She also paid for the gas..

    "..she only takes PREMIUM.." Sunset had protested.

    ..and cigarettes. From a suspiciously large wad of cash. You decided it was best not to ask. It was also best not to ask why she took the cashier aside, and came back out a bit later with more bills to stuff into one of her jacket pockets.

    Back on the road, you were still a few hundred miles from San Diego. It would, in fact, take you all the rest of the day to get there. Lunch was at a burger joint you hit up along the highway. Dinner was at a sit-down diner that was in a tiny California town well off the highway itself. The four of you, of course, talked to break up the monotony. You were in the back seat with Derpy.. and for some reason (teenage hormones) you couldn't keep your hands off of her.

    "Hey, Anon.." Gilda cut in. "..just fuckin' DO her already." She smirked.

    "In the back seat? While driving?" You cocked a brow.

    "In MY back seat!?" Sunset protested.

    "Ah-ah-ah..." You eyed her.

    Sunset shut up and looked down.. no.. she looked into the rear view mirror as you and Derpy started hard-core making out. She watched as Derpy got Anon Jr. free from his bonds once again, and sucked it dry like a fountain in the desert. She watched.. and blushed.. and couldn't help but touch herself. Right in front of Gilda.. who merely watched her, and saved that memory for later.

    San Diego.. you got there around 10PM.

    "So.. uh.. how do we meet Scorpan's boss?" You ask, having finally gotten your pants back up.

    "Simple enough. I know where his Old Lady lives." She shrugged a little. "I can get his number from her, call him, and set up a meeting." She pulled in to the parking lot of a Super 8 Motel. "No sign of the Griffons.. I think we're safe."

    Gilda paid for.. well, they only had ONE room available.. and the desk clerk wouldn't give you guys the keys until you made Sunset say that she and Gilda were a couple.

    Which, of course, was a horrible mistake, since Derpy was twice as horny as you were, and demanded another hard round of intense fucking.

    And making Sunset watch just made her horny as fuck.

    And Gilda LIKED to watch Sunset get horny as fuck.

    And when you saw that you basically had an audience.. you ordered your maid to service your new friend.

    She protested a little.. but just gave in, since you were now watching her get it from Gilda.. and Gilda, strangely enough, had a rather large double-ended toy with an interesting hook-up thing in the middle, stuck in her tote. Which she used on Sunset after strapping it on. And you directed Sunset to make Gilda very happy..

    Teenage hormones indeed!

    The next morning, you looked over to see Gilda chatting quietly on the phone with someone. Sunset was naked and utterly destroyed in the bed next to her, a strange smile plastered across her face. Derpy was just curled up with you, your legs all tangled together.

    Did you love Derpy? Really? It sure felt that way. Now, whenever you think about her, you get butterflies in your stomach. Your face gets flushed. And you have the urge to hug her tightly. You were just a teenager.. you didn't know Love from Stomach Flu.. but this didn't feel like no damn flu..

    "..yeah, really? You know where he is, RIGHT NOW?" Gilda sounded excited. "Yeah! Awesome.. Yeah.. yeah.. got it." She nodded. "Thanks, girlie, you're a total life saver." She hung up, and sighed happily. "You have no idea how much." She prodded the group's little secretly submissive Sex Maid. "Hey, Fireball, get up."

    "Wake up, Derpy.." You prodded her.

    "I got the location of Scorpan's boss." She nodded. "He's meeting with the guys that first brought the drugs in - their bosses - today. At noon. Old warehouse on the docks." She smirked, running her fingers through her almost-feathery hair.

    "Uh.. awesome?" You tilt your head.

    "No, no, this is even better than just meeting his Boss. Scorpan's a dead man for sure if the Suppliers know that he half-inched their drugs, AND took his boss's cash." She was practically giddy. "Come on, you lazy-asses! We gotta get going!"

    Half-inched. You knew that term was old.. as in, give an inch, take a mile? Where did she hear that, that it was even part of her vocabulary?

    You and Derpy took a shower together to speed things up. Sunset - somewhat reluctantly - did the same with Gilda, but apparently, Gilda was all business in there. She was after the prize - sex wasn't important right now.

    Back in Sunset's car, Gilda drove the four of you towards the docks. You'd manage to get there over an hour early - fortunately, she had the good sense (read: was talked into) to stop at another fast food place for something to eat.

    What the four of you saw there, though..

    "..shit, is that what I think it is?" Gilda was squinting at the warehouse. You were all parked somewhere out of the way. Gilda and you had climbed up on top of a shipping container to watch the place.

    "What?" You tilt your head.. and squint. Fuck this.. "Derpy, hand me my backpack?"

    "Sure thing, honey." She was calling you pet names, now.

    Out from your backpack came your trusty binoculars. Which, thankfully, hadn't been ruined so far. You look through them, and are flabbergasted at the sight. So, you pass them to Gilda.

    "Yeah.. that's Scorpan, alright." She snorted. "What's HE doing here?!"

    "Now what?" You look to her.

    "We're still going in. He must've had the same brain wave I did - about going to his boss." She huffed. "We just gotta hope he doesn't gun us down on sight."

    "What's the alternative?" You didn't like the sound of this, all of a sudden.

    "Graduate from Tijuana High?" She shot you a look.

    "Right. I get it." And you'd shimmy back off of the container and down to the ground.

    You told Derpy and Sunset what was up.. of course, Derpy was a bit scared, and Sunset was livid. But, you reminded her what the alternative was. Mexico - and rape + death - sounded a lot worse than risking possibly getting shot at.

    "Look at it this way!" Derpy chimed. "At least getting shot to death is fairly quick." She shrugged. "They probably have assault rifles and stuff. We'll get hosed and bleed out pretty quickly."

    "Thanks for the reassurance.." She grumbled without adding a personal insult.

    Gilda kept watching. As the appointed hour approached, she saw a couple cars pull around back, the opposite side of the warehouse from where Scorpan was skulking around. Then, finally.. his Boss's car. And his escorts.

    "Come on, dweebs!" That didn't sound like much of an insult, with her tone. "It's show time!"

    She was off the cargo container lickety-split, and the four of you were moving quickly to cover the half kilometer or so to the warehouse. Just in case, though, Gilda pulled something nickel-plated from her tote, stuck it behind her back, and stuffed the tote somewhere out-of-sight.

    You only caught a glimpse of it, but it was something in the semi-automatic flavor. It was a bit unnerving that.. well.. she had a gun, and she was preparing to possibly use it for something like this. Forget the whole political shit, forget the fact that your Dad had taken you shooting since you were a kid.. this was about a gun and human lives. Human lives. Not squirrels, or something. The reality hit home hard enough to twist your stomach into knots.

    You were really going to do this. Walk into the Lion's Den and tempt fate.

    You got to the warehouse right after Scorpan and his boss went inside. The Boss's goons went in with him. The four of you got in through a side entrance - Gilda picked the lock - and you snuck around the crates and things, trying to find the exact spot they were meeting at. Then, you heard the talking..

    "..I'm telling you, that crazy bitch shot your guys." That was Scorpan's voice.

    "He's my associate. He's never given me reason to doubt him." That must be the Boss.

    The four of you got closer, getting up behind the boxes, you found them. A little clear spot near the middle of the warehouse, with a large crate about the height of a table, in the middle. Five guys on Scorpan's side of it, and four on the other side.

    "You do realize we found the bodies, yes? Our product is gone, and the money was not delivered to us." The other side of the crate was shadowed - it was hard to make out who the Suppliers were.

    "I realize this." The Boss said. "But, as you know, there are no guarantees in this business. I, likewise, lack both the product and the money." He gave a confident shrug, hand upturned. "We both have taken a loss because of a loose cannon. A loose cannon I intend to toss off the ship, as it were."

    "Hm.." The shadowed Supplier tilted his head towards Scorpan. "..and how do we know that the next deal will also not.. meet an accident?"

    "Because I'm here, now. If you have some.. substitute product, then I have some.. substitute money. Just as we had originally planned.." A chuckle.

    The suppliers all chuckle as well. And nodded in affirmative.

    Scorpan didn't chuckle.

    "What's the matter, Scorpan?" His Boss asked.

    "Well, see, it's like this, Boss.." Scorpan started.

    Suddenly, the Griffons appeared out of nowhere.. just melting in from the shadows. From behind boxes and crates.. the four of you can hear guns cocking, safeties being flipped off.

    "..maybe we don't want to be drug pushers for fish like you, no more?" He chuckled, now. "Maybe we rather just take the money and live happily ever after? Hm?"

    "YOU TRAITOROUS-" His Boss started, but Scorpan stuck a Glock under his chin.

    "Tell your boys to back the fuck off." Scorpan said, calmly. He looked at the Suppliers. "I ain't got no shit with you. Ain't gonna risk movin' yer product - I'm just after the cash. You can just walk outta here."

    "It's now or never, Gilda." You murmur to her. "Sunset, Derpy, stay here."

    "But, Anon.." Derpy gave you the puppy eyes.

    "He's right. Come on, we better hide." Sunset tugged at Derpy's arm.

    "No reason for you to go out there, flip-flop.." Gilda chided you.

    "I may as well." You shrug. "If they off their Boss, there's nothing stopping them. And this all happened at MY house."

    "Alright.." *Tch* "..let's go."

    Thus, you and Gilda walked right out into the middle of the Mexican stand-off.

    "AH! THERE'S THE BITCH!" Scorpan chirped, excitedly. "The fuck you doin' here!?"

    "Comin' to see your Boss, Scorp." She nodded, calmly, her lids half closed. "Tirek." She nodded to him, despite him being held hostage.

    "Gilda.." Tirek sounded a bit displeased at all this. "..you here to stab me in the back, too?"

    "So, you're the loose cannon?" The leading Supplier looked at her. "You.. you.. we would like to have a talk with."

    "Maybe. Maybe not. Gilda?" You look at her.

    "I got somethin' here what proves I didn't do shit to your boys.." She flicked a look at Scorpan.

    Scorpan seemed confused until Gilda produced her cell phone.

    "Got video right here. Shows Scorpan goin' nuts, along with the rest of these mugs.." She nodded to the rest of the Griffons. "..one'a your boys got away with the goods, but I'm thinkin' Scorpan here got him anyway. Probably stashed the goods AND the cash for himself. Heck.. he probably's got some guys waiting outside for you.. intendin' to make it look like you an' Tirek got into it, and offed each other.."

    "YOU LYING BITCH!" Scorpan screamed at her, jamming the Glock under Tirek's chin a little harder.

    "We would be very interested to see this.." The lead Supplier, though, got out his cell phone and made a speed dial call. "..as would our boss."

    Insurance. If their boss hears what's going on, and Scorpan does something, he'll never survive. Scorpan knew that. He knew the only choice he had now, was to act..

    You know how some people say that time slows down when you're under intense stress? In your case - at least at first - it seemed to speed up. Scorpan pulling the Glock from under Tirek's chin, leveling it at Gilda, and pulling the trigger. The flash of the round going off. Gilda falling back. You grabbing her. Tirek's guards going for their guns. You feeling the hard metal of Gilda's piece in your hands. The Griffons starting to open fire. The Suppliers turning and clearing leather. You drawing Gilda's gun as Tirek and Scorpan wrestle for Scorpan's Glock. You getting Gilda's Beretta clear from her waistband, and thumbing off the safety. Gunfire all around you. Bodies falling. Someone screaming on the phone. The sight picture of Scorpan's head perfect along the Beretta. The sound of a muffled shot, and Tirek falling away from Scorpan. The feeling of the Beretta's trigger being pulled. The recoil of the slide along the frame rails..

    ..the sight of blood spurting from Scorpan's forehead as the round impacts between his eyebrows, T-Zoning him and killing him absolutely instantly..

    ..the flashes of light that flicker all around you as the gun battle rages on. The feeling of Gilda's weight in your arms and you frantically pull her away. The sounds of ricochets as they splinter wood and smack off the hard concrete floor. The coolness of the shadow as you get behind a container. The warmth of Gilda's blood as you press your hands to her open wound.

    Then.. the silence.. telling you it was all over..

    This all felt like it took but a couple seconds. It was closer to half a minute.

    *GHN!* "Fuck.." Gilda looked at you, and looked at the wound in her arm. "..it's not THAT bad." She frowned. "Nice shot, Dweeb King." She smirked, though.

    Sirens. Police sirens. Someone.. somewhere.. heard all the shooting and called the cops. Was it a stray dock worker out on a smoke break? One of the Suppliers, as they fled the scene? You'd never find that out.

    All you knew was that the Cavalry had arrived just in time to clean up all the bodies. And one look around the corner told you that all three sides had wiped each other out, to a man. Nothing moved. Not even the sounds of someone trying to get away.

    "Well.. your plan sucked, Gilda.." You shrug. "..but at least we don't have to worry about Scorpan any more.. or his Boss." A chuckle as Derpy and Sunset came out of hiding.

    "What do we do, Anon?" Sunset finally asked.

    "May as well wait for the cops.." You shrug. "Gilda needs a hospital. And my folks are going to kill me when they see the house and all the damage done to it. Unless I have a police report."

    You get your stories absolutely straight.. right about as the SWAT team charges into the building..


    EPILOGUE


    Gilda recovered. And because she stashed her tote, she had absolutely nothing illegal on her. You told the cops that you invited a few friends over to your place, your girlfriend got sick, and while you were helping her, Scorpan and his crew showed up and tried to rape Sunset. You and Gilda fighting them off is what started the whole mess. You, of course, left out the part of the drug-induced threesome, and the fact that Gilda had packed both a handgun and dealer weight in pot along for the trip.

    You told them that Gilda had proof that Scorpan was doing illegal business, and were going to his boss about it, when the shooting all happened all of a sudden, with Scorpan killing Tirek and leading that plot against Tirek's group and the suppliers. That he was going to steal the drugs and the money again, and fuck off to somewhere that didn't have an extradition treaty.

    After seeing Gilda's video, they bought it. They had to. Four witnesses compared to over a dozen bodies?

    You started dating - and regularly fucking - Derpy almost right away. Sunset.. eh.. well.. let's just say she bought herself another Maid outfit. And Gilda? Well, she stopped stuffing you into trash cans.

    Actually, once school started and someone tried it, she made sure it be known that you were off limits. It got her detention, but who cares? She didn't. And no one else cared to bother you, after that. After all - you were the guy that saw a full blown drug war, got Scorpan killed, got the Griffons wiped out, and lived to tell the tale.

    That's what you call an awesome reputation.
