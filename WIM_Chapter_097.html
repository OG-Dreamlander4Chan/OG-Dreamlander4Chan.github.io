Part 1: Midnight Mayaimi

TIME: 23:47 ERST
DATE: War Day 847/1 Octavius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Mayaimi Beach, Apalachee, Equestria


K: "STOP RIGHT THERE!" I had my Glock out, and aimed at the individuals grabbing Rarity.

One of them yanked the tampon dispenser off the wall, and flung it at us - a smart move, since I had to block it with my off hand. They were out the window by the time I recovered. Jackie grabbed Rarity's discarded purse, and the four of us got to the window, and pulled ourselves through and out of it. I was first, hitting the ground, just as the club music started.

I stayed in a crouched position, so AJ, Dex, and Scratch could climb out an on to my shoulders. They did so one at a time, and we charged up the alleyway, after the kidnappers. They were a gaggle of club-dressed individuals - some on two legs, some on four. I thought, immediately, this was something to do with Tirek. They had to have knocked Rarity out, or she'd be screaming her head off and fighting back.

Dex: "They're movin' pretty fast, dude!" He was at full gallop, as I was at a full run.

Applejack was outpacing all of us. Scratch was just behind me and Dex.

The problem is, we couldn't stop and take up a firing position - there wasn't a clear shot that I could see in the dim street light, and any pause would put more distance between them and us. So, I chugged onwards. Remember, humans evolved to chase their prey until the prey were too tired to keep going. This was literally what I was evolved to do.

K: "Scratch! Police box! Get us backup!" I pointed to the telephone pole at the end of the street we were coming to.

Police Boxes at this stage of Equestria's technological revolution were locked boxes with morse code machines inside. Police officers carried keys.. I saw Scratch slow to a stop and get her halfmoon buckle off - she was going to force the lock off.

The three of us continued pursuit. No radios, no way to signal for help. Mayaimi had a vibrant night life, but it was still a pony city, and it simply didn't need a constant Gendarmes patrol - most would be at the nearest Gendarmes station, and while some would be on patrol, but the chance of coming across them was slim.

We'd covered four blocks already, and Applejack was the closest to catching up with them. Fear for her safety dumped adrenaline into my system, and undying loyalty to me dumped it for Dex. We managed to push ourselves just a bit, and by the time Applejack was just out of touch range, we were only three lengths behind her.

Then, they got to the water. A raised section above the water's surface with a retaining wall below, going right to the ocean.. and they jumped. I had to reach out and grab Applejack by the collar of her shirt, and pull back, as gunfire came from the BOAT that was apparently there.. we landed on my ass.

Dex managed to get to the edge, and flop down, returning fire as the motorboat started pulling away. I pulled myself up, and looked around at the water.. there was a motor launch from RNS Carzano, a Comune-class destroyer, tied up at the nearest pier.

K: "Over here!" I got up and made a mad dash for it.

Mariano di Base Enrico Ferarro: "Ah! General K! What is shooting?" Broken, but workable Equestrian.

K: "We've got kidnappers! We need to get to the Carzano!" I motioned for everyone to jump in.

MdB Ferraro: "SI, GENERALE!" He puffed up his chest, and kicked off the rope, jumping in about the same time Dex did, starting the engine, and pushing off.

Scratch just barely managed to join us in time, diving off the edge of the pier, and making a magic sound buffer to 'bounce' herself into the launch.

We got right over to the Carzano, and as we did, I was already issuing orders.

K: "OFFICER OF THE DECK, SOUND GENERAL QUARTERS! WHOEVER'S ON BOARD, GET TO YOUR STATIONS, AND GET THE ENGINES TURNED OVER!" I grabbed the ladder as the crane for the motor launch swung over to snatch it from the water.

Up I went, and I got on deck, going right for the bridge. I could feel Dex, AJ, and Scratch at my heels.

Tenente Minore Alfredo Linguine: "Generale! Tenente Minore Alfredo Linguine!" He saluted as I got on board. "I am highest ranked aboard!"

K: "Yeap." I nodded. "I need you on Comms." I pointed. "Dex, you've steered a tub before, get to the helm. Scratch, weapons station. AJ, lookout." I directed, and sat int he captain's chair.

Tm Linguine: "Generale! Engine room reports half'a power ready, full'a power in'a three minutes!" He nodded to Dex.

Dex: "Engines to one half." He rolled the control over, and took the wheel.

Scratch: C> "This is Sergeant 1st Class Vinyl Scratch, Equestrian 1st Royal Rangers. All weapon stations load, and show ready." She slid into the seat.

Applejack: "Ah k'n see 'em, hun!" She was already at the Flying Bridge, forward of us, and looking through the high powered binoculars. "They's doin' at least thirty knots!"

K: "Comms." I held my hand out, and Linguine handed me the mic. C> "Attention all Naval Forces at Port of Mayaimi. Red Alert. We have a kidnapping in progress - it's Rarity. Enemy vessel is a 10 meter launch, doing 30 knots, heading south-east towards Fisher Island, towards the channel between Fisher and Vandalia Key! All non-capital ships, and City Gendarmes Water Patrol Vessels respond immediately! I am aboard RNS Carzano, and in pursuit." I handed it back.

After about a minute, Linguine looked up.

Tm Linguine: "Assisi, Forli, Magenta, Glencoe, Fire River, York, and Spearhill all report making'a steam, an' responding. City Gendarmes Naval Patrol Vessels Biscayne, Brickell, and Palm reportings they head'a towards de channel, an' will try to intercept." He nodded, and looked at Dex. "Engine'a room reports full speed ready! She'a do about 34 knots, we catch'a da bastarda's!" Note - he just insulted their manhood by referring to them as feminine bastards.

I grinned widely to him, and nodded, understanding completely.

K: "I like you Lieutenant." And chuckled to myself. "Dex."

Dex: "Going to full speed." He nodded. "AJ, gimme a heading, dudette."

Applejack: "Head south-south west, they's tryin'a be slippery!"

Scratch: "Main guns report ready. Machine guns armed and ready. Torpedoes coming online." She smirked. "A-Turret is asking for clearance to get range and bearing."

K: "Give it to them." I nodded. "We won't fire on them directly, but let them know we'll be firing a few shorts and wides to get their attention."

Dex: "They picked the wrong lady to kidnap." He smirked.

K: "Yup." I nodded to Linguine. "Break out the ship's small arms."

Tm Linguine: "Si, Generale!" He nodded to the petty officer manning the side observation post.

The petty officer opened the wall locker and pulled out weapons. Boaretta Modello '04 sub-machine guns were pulled out and loaded. Not all naval vessels maintained assault rifles for the crew or boarding parties, since ranges were so tiny aboard ships. I was handed one, along with a bandoleer containing four spare magazines. Linguine cinched a pistol belt on, and officer's sword, before accepting a subgun.

K: "You plan to hit them with that?" I nodded to the sword.

Tm Linguine: "If such opportunity presents, Generale." He gave me a grin.

Oh, I LIKE this pony. I can see him having a great career.

The Modello 4 is very similar to a Ridgway, but far more refined. It had a floating firing pin, sliding dust cover, automatic safety, compensator, and a simple toggle switch ahead of the trigger bar to select between full and semi-auto. It was also about a pound heavier with its wooden stock.

K: "Time to intercept?" I got up and moved to the Flying Bridge.

Dex: "Shouldn't be too much longer." He nodded ahead of us. "They're running outta room to run."

Indeed, the responding vessels were moving into the bay, and surrounding the area. The RCS York was making full steam to cut off the southern route, with Fire River. Glencoe and Spearhill were moving to press the vessel from the north, while the Roaman vessels were mostly pressing from the west. I could see lights from the Gendarmes vessels, reaching the channel.

They were just about stuck.

K: "Get us up on 'em." I nodded to Linguine. "Let the fleet know we're firing a few warning shots and not to fire." Then to Scratch. "A-Turret, fire one shot at least 100 meters wide a'port, and another wide a'stern of the enemy vessel. Let them know we're right here."

Scratch: "Aye!" She relayed the order.

Tm Linguine: "Si, Generale!" He made the broadcast.

The forward turret swung and fired one shell that landed about 120 meters wide of the fleeing enemy vessel, and a second that dropped about 90 meters to the rear. The enemy vessel took this as a reason to swing southwards.

York and Fire River were right there.. pulling in tight. The escaping enemy launch was fast running out of room to maneuver. I grabbed the megaphone on the Flying Bridge, and moved to the Machine Gun notch on the wing of the Flying Bridge.

K: "STOP YOUR ENGINE AND SURRENDER! YOU HAVE NO WHERE TO GO!" I pointed to one of the sailors to illuminate the vessel.

They slowed.. almost stopped, and seemed to be considering their options. There were six of them, then Rarity. I casually slid AJ into the dual MG mount's operating harness. She slowly racked the bolts. I leaned over the edge a bit, and aimed the Boaretta towards the vessel, using the strap to allow me to hold it in one hand.

K: "RARITY! CAN YOU HEAR ME!?" I called, loudly.

I saw them all conversing, then moving Rarity a bit, to wake her up, and she started getting catty on them.. I could hear her telling them off.

Tm Linguine: "Signore, a sniper on RCS York say he has a bead on the engine man." He tapped me.

K: "Clearance to fire, him only." I nodded. "THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING! WE HAVE EXPERT SNIPERS AIMED AT ALL OF YOU! SURRENDER, OR DIE!"

A moment later.. and I saw a suppressed muzzle flash come from York's bridge. The individual manning the engine on the launch was tossed overboard by the sudden jerk of their brain short circuiting.

The rest of them FROZE in place.

Rarity: "K, DARLING!? GET OVER HERE!!" She demand-screamed.

Tm Linguine: "Signore, the launch is ready for you." He smirked.

K: "I like you. I really like you. You're good at this." I patted his mane, and he beamed a mile wide, tapping his hooves a bit. "Come with. AJ?" I nodded to Dex. "You have command, Major."

Dex: "You got it, dude." He nodded.

The three of us made for the Launch, and got in. The crew swung us over the side, and lowered us faster than normal, letting the chain go completley when we were about two feet from the water. Linguine already had the engine going, and we zoomed out there. Aboard with us were two other sailors, armed with sub-guns. A motor launch from Fire River was headed this way as well, and one of the Gendarmes vessels was not far behind it.

I had Linguine stop us about ten meters from the enemy boat.

K: "SHOW ME YOUR HOOVES, HANDS, OR WHATEVER YOU GOT! DON'T FRIGGIN' MOVE!" I demanded.

Applejack: "Rarity! You okay, sugarcube!?" She got close to the gunwhale of the boat, low, and using the edge to prop her weapon on.

Rarity: "I am intact, darlings!" She hissed. "But they've RUINED my evening!" She got up, a bit unsteady, and motioned for me to toss her the launch's mooring line.

I did so, everyone aiming guns at the perpetrators. Rarity had two of them pull the launch close to the motor boat.

Gendarmes Reeve Sunny Crocker: "General!" He nodded from the Biscayne's deck. "My partner and I are pretty sure these guys aren't with Tirek!"

Gendarmes Inspector Record Tubs: "That's right, sir!" He stepped forwards.

I almost had to bite my tongue.. Crocker was dressed in a pony version of a subdued t-shirt suit, and Tubs was in a technicolor one with a loose tie. Crocker was a white stallion with a dark blonde, flared mane. Tubs was a dark tan stallion with a close cut curly mane.

K: "Let me guess - you two are with Vice?" I smiled a bit.

Crocker: "Yeah.. clothes gave it away, huh?" He looked at the prisoners, and pointed. "Gargan! I know that's you in there! Take off your hood!" He casually aimed a Morgan at them.

Tubs was armed with a cut-down Sagebrush shotgun, and a Filly Arms "Friday" revolver, something like a Colt Detective Special - another commercial weapon I'd invented and marketed years ago.

Gargan: "You got me, Crocker!" He stood and raised his hands.. he was a Diamond Dog.

K: "Well, I'll be-" I stopped, and motioned for the Canidans and Tenente Linguine to lower their weapons. "They wanted her to find GEMS for them, didn't they?!" I pointed.

Crocker: "You got it, sir. We've been chasing them for a week, since we heard they were after a gem haul that's supposed to be in the swamps somewhere. When we heard you were coming to the city, we had a feeling they'd try for her." He shrugged.

Tubs: "Problem is, we lost track of them. They had a few of their boys stage a fake robbery of a jewlery store to throw us off, had us chasin' our tails." He did, indeed, have a very Manehattanish accent.

K: "Your bust, gentlemen." I shrugged, and offered Rarity my hand. "If you'll excuse us."

She got aboard the launch from the Carzano, and we pulled away, to let the Gendarmes handle business. I was laughing to myself for a good, solid, few minutes.

Midnight in Mayaimi was just as colorful here, as it was in Miami, Florida circa.. 1986? The world's funny some times..

Part 2: Trials Unending

TIME: 09:00 ERST
DATE: War Day 849/3 Octavius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Ossachite, Apalachee, Equestria


The trial of the treasonous Unicorns was set to commence. The entire State Militia turned out, and was on alert. Security measures extended for 40 kilometers in every direction, right down to scout planes looking for trouble. We weren't taking chances, this time.

Flash Sentry: "We'll get it done this time, General." He nodded, chamber-checking his Bradley.

K: "We will." I nodded, adjusting my tie.

I had the tailor in Mayaimi Beach make me a formal suit, again. Two, actually - one as a military dress uniform, with the top coat being a tunic with a leather pistol belt. The other being a normal looking Human dress suit. The dress suit was dark blue, with a medium blue shirt and white collar, and a red tie. The military uniform was Olive Drab, Khaki shirt, black tie, and a peaked cap to go with it.

I rest my hand on my pistol belt, currently holding my Glock until the new pistols came along. The prisoners were being Perp-Walked from the prison van towards the front of the court house. A large, but silent, crowd had gathered to watch. There were a few signs.. "Remember Cloudsdale" - "Friendship over Fear" - "Equestrians United" - "Love Eternal" and some others. Tree Hugger and the "Special Militia Security Detachment, Quonset Point Air Force Base" had showed up to support us, and spread the love.

The ponies rejected their calls for hatred. It made me smile. Once the line of prisoners was clear of the van, I fell in behind them, on edge, but not trying to show it. After years of war, though, I was considering every possible outcome.

We entered the Magistrate Chamber, and were greeted by the three new Magistrates, and new Royal Prosecutor. The prisoners were filed into the gallery and defendant's table.

Lead Magistrate Eagle Sharpfeather: "This court will come to order!" He aimed the gavel at the defendants. "The Magistrate Panel has already read the evidence from the previous attempt to place you on trial. And while we recognize that The Crown wishes to present further evidence, in light of your escape attempt, and the terror which your group has brought upon this nation, The Magistrate Panel is prepared to pass judgment!"

Defense Attorney Sunflower Bookends: "The defense objects!" She stood right up, and leaned over the table. "We contend that the defendants were kidnapped, not rescued in some kind of jail break attempt!"

LM Sharpfather: "Be that as it may, the Royal Prosecutor has filed additional charges on those grounds." He crossed his forelimbs.

Bookends: "Then.. we.. insist that some kind of evidence be presented to that end!" She snorted a bit, but was very clearly just buying time.

Prosecutor Justen Lane: "Fine. Crown Prosecution calls General K to the stand." He stood, and crossed his forelegs.

LM Sharpfeather: "So be it. General K?" He looked at me.

I stood, and moved to the front of the court. Since they didn't have one, I handed the Bailiff a pocket Bible I'd picked up in Colorado. When he raised it, I placed my palm on it, and my hand over my heart.

Bailiff Crescent Gilding: "Do you swear upon this holy symbol to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so save you?" A bit different..

K: "I so swear to my Almighty God." I nodded and sat down.

Lane: "Now, then.." He paced forwards. "State your full name and title for the record?"

K: "K---- ------ K---, General-Field Marshal of the Equestrian Armed Forces, Supreme Allied Commander of the North Equus Independent Group of Herds Treaty Organization, and Knight of the Crystal Realm, sworn defender of the unborn Prince or Princess of the Crystal Kingdom." I nodded to him.

Lane: "Quite the title. Would you simply tell the court.. what it is that you've done in the last four years?" He looked at the Magistrates.

K: "I have commanded the war effort as directed by Her Royal Majesties, Princess Celestia and Luna. Pursuant to that objective, I have either directly or indirectly commanded almost every major battle we have been involved in since the sneak attack on Canterlot over two and a half years ago." I nodded to the gallery.

Lane: "So, it's safe to say, you're an expert on war." He looked at me.

K: "I am the only expert on war on this planet. None of the species of this world understand warfare, the pain it brings, the choices and sacrifices that must be made." I shrugged. "But, I must ALSO testify, for the record, that I am not perfect, and I know it."

Lane: "Alright. Given all that.. how do you know that the Defendants were rescued and not kidnapped?" He got right to the point.

K: "Simple. The commander of the Mercenary Team AND the lead defendant both admitted to it." I shrugged.

Lane: "And how did you come across this confession?" He looked between me and the Defense, again.

K: "I asked the Mercenary Commander. Sol Shimmer volunteered the information, saying that, he'd clearly failed, and would be executed instead of saved." I gestured to Sol.

Lane: "Did you use any enhanced interrogation techniques?" He asked, plainly.

K: "One of my General Staff extracted him from the crashed aircraft rather roughly, but it had nothing to do with asking him any questions." I shrugged.

Lane: "Nothing further at this time." He nodded.

Bookends: "General K.. it's true that Defendant Shimmer was roughed up, then?" She gestured to him.

K: "Only as much as required, given that we were in a combat situation at the time, to gain his compliance with being moved." I looked at her evenly.

Bookends: "Did anyone else confirm that this was a rescue, and not a kidnapping?" She tilted her head.

K: "Other prisoners, when asked." I nodded to her.

Bookends: "Any other witnesses?" She leaned in a bit.

K: "I didn't bother to ask Bey Kerim of Antatolia what the deal was, when engaging him and his forces in combat, if that's what you're asking, and I don't think Tirek himself would care to testify." I sighed a bit.

Bookends: "So.. you can't truly substantiate these charges, can you?" She slid back towards me.

K: "I launched a mission costing several million bits, cost me five aircraft, led to three Paratroopers, and one Canidan sailor being injured, specifically to substantiate these charges." I cocked a brow. "That is the conclusion I reached."

Bookends: "But.. you can't prove it." She stated.

K: "I believe whether or not I've proven it beyond a reasonable doubt is up to the Magistrates, Counselor." I leaned back a bit. "And if we're here, they've already decided."

Bookends: "..yes, well.." She straightened up, unfazed. "..there has been one instance in a Royal Trial where at least one charge was dropped at judgment."

Lane: "Objection! Is there a question with that?" He stood up, and leaned a bit into the table.

LM Sharpfeather: "Sustained. Ask a question, Counselor, or I will excuse the witness." He nodded to her.

Bookends: "In your vast strategic and tactical knowledge, General, would it be fair to say that this was NOT the original plan?" She went right back at it.

K: "Actually, yes, and I have evidence of that - testimony of the same persons I just mentioned. The extraction was actually to be carried out on the day of arrest." I had to give her that.

Bookends: "So, it would be fair to say the attack on the courthouse was not planned?" She raised her right foreleg, on her hind legs, and leaned against the defense table.

K: "Yes, that's fair to say." I nodded slowly.

Bookends: "And, therefore, the subjects were not expecting rescue at that point, after being arrested?" She held out her other foreleg, hoof-pads up.

K: "Yes." I nodded again - I could tell where she was going with this, and I admired it.

Bookends: "So, when the Mercenary Team broke into their jail cell, and removed them, would it be fair to say that the prisoners expected to be executed, not rescued?" She tilted her head.

K: "Yes." I kept my answers short - shorter than she wanted, I could tell.

Bookends: "And, therefore, removing them from Equestrian protection constituted a death sentence in their eyes?" One at a time..

K: "Yes." I crossed my arms.

Bookends: "Would it therefore be fair to say that this removal was against their will - and therefore a kidnapping, not a rescue?" She went forward on all fours, and leaned towards me.

K: "If the defendants believed the Mercenaries were there to execute them, and not rescue them, they could have overpowered them on the aircraft. The outnumbered them about three to one, and only one of the Mercenaries carried a firearm. Two of the defendants are Air Force officers, and could have commandeered the aircraft, flown back, and offered their surrender. They did none of these things. They allowed and aided in the escape, using Unicorn Magic to lift the aircraft to flight altitude, and strained that magic ability to help get the aircraft to the Eyesore Islands.. which, as I said, led to four people being injured, and cost the war effort a great deal of money." I leaned right back towards her. "While the rescue was unplanned, the result is the same, and their compliance and active assistance was instrumental in its even patrial success." I gave a hand gesture. "A fine attempt, Counselor."

Lane: "Lead Magistrate, is the Court satisfied with this testimony?" He stood, before she could try digging again.

LM Sharpfeather: "Indeed we are. This questioning is ended. The witness is excused with the Court's thanks." He tapped his gavel.

I got down and resumed my seat in the gallery.

LM Sharpfeather: "The Magistrates are ready to pass judgment." He nodded to the Bailiff.

Bailiff: "Defendants will now rise!" He stepped forwards.

They all did.. Sol and Night Light were glaring at me.

LM Sharpfeather: "It is the UNANIMOUS judgment of this court that the defendants, all of them, are GUILTY of ALL crimes accused!" He banged his gavel three times.

Magistrate Righteous Windy: "The sentence for Defendant Sol Shimmer and Defendant Night Light is execution by firing squad. The sentence of the remaining defendants is Gelding, and Exile to the Demilitarized Zone between the Crystal Kingdom, Canida, Equestria, and The Khyangese Republic. To be carried out immediately!" He also banged his gavel.

Equestria's first formal execution in over a thousand years..

Part 3: Terminations

TIME: 09:33 ERST

I stood.

K: "We are prepared to carry out the execution forthwith." I nodded to Flash Sentry.

He went over and fetched Sol and Night.

Night Lite "THIS ISN'T OVER, HUMAN! All you've done is DOOM.. EVERY.. pony! Instead of SAVING.. those that DESERVE IT!" His speech was slurred because I'd shot his horn off a couple weeks ago.

We marched them out to the back area of the Court House. A Royal Guard squad was lined up already - Flash's team from Canterlot. I took position in the line as they loaded their Sherman Parade Rifles with two rounds each.

Night was tied to a post, first. Sandbags behind him would protect the court house itself from bullet holes. Twilight moved up to him, but kept her distance.

Twilight: "Father..?" She sighed. "This is your last chance!" She begged him, for his recognition.. his love.. something.

Night Lite "I ask.. this creature.. not address me in my final moments." He sneered.

K: "Indeed." I paced forwards with a small tray, on which was a blindfold, a rolled cigarette, and a shot of Brandy. "Blindfold?"

Night Lite: "No. I face death with my eyes open." He glared straight ahead.

K: "Brandy?" I offered.

Night Lite: "...yes." He cleared his throat.

I reached forwards with the shot glass, and poured it into his mouth for him. He swallowed - I was expecting him to spit it in my eyes.

Night Lite: "The only thing left in this world that I'll miss."

K: "Cigarette?" I nodded for the final material offer.

Night Lite: "No." He breathed calmly.

K: "Have you any final words?" I asked.

Night Lite: "Unicorns are the superior species of Pony. One day, we will take our place as the unquestioned rulers of the masses." He nodded.

K: "Do you want Last Rites?" The last request.

Night Lite: "I have prayed to MY Goddess already." He meant Galactica Spark, I was pretty sure.

K: "So be it." I nodded. "May your Goddess have mercy on your soul." Respect, even if he hadn't earned it in the slightest.

I marched back to the line of Royal Guards.

K: "READY!" I drew my sword - Senshin Bushi's, actually.

The soldiers raised their rifles.

K: "AIM!" I raised it.

They leaned in a bit, and made certain they were aimed correctly.

K: "FIRE!" I dropped the tip to the ground.

The gunfire rang out.. and Night's body slumped. Not a single miss, every rifle fired, all six rounds hit him in the chest. I stepped forwards, with Dr. Allcome.

Cody: "The prisoner is deceased." He nodded.

K: "Next!" I nodded to the Gendarmes that were waiting, and they removed Night's body.

Sol was brought over and tied up. I once again advanced with the tray of comfort.

K: "Sol." I nodded to him.

Sunset: "I hope you rot in Hell.. 'father.'" She snorted at him from the crowd. "Join that bitch you married. FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU TO HELL, YOU BASTARD!"

I shot a look at her, then Applejack, who pulled her back.

K: "Blindfold?" I asked him.. unlike Night, he did seem nervous.

Sol: "Yes." He cleared his throat.

I tied it over his eyes carefully, and tight.

K: "Brandy?" I offered.

Sol: "Yes." He lowered his head a bit, the gravity of the situation starting to get to him.

As with Night Light, I tipped the drink into his mouth carefully. He swallowed it like his first drink of water in years.

K: "Cigarette?" I offered.

Sol: "..don't suppose it'll kill me, now. Yes." He cleared his throat.

I stuck the cigarette to his lips, and struck a match on the post, lighting it for him.

K: "Any final words?" I asked.

Sol: "I am convinced I was doing the right thing for all of us. I only regret that I failed." He looked straight ahead.

K: "Priest?" I asked, simply.

Sol: "I am right with my Goddess." Is all he said.

I stepped back to the line of soldiers.

K: "READY!" I drew my sword again.

The soldiers raised their rifles oncemore.

K: "AIM!" I raised it a second time.

They leaned in a bit, aiming carefully.

K: "FIRE!" I dropped the tip to the ground one more time.

Sol spasmed.. and twitched. I immediately walked up to him, and realized the shots were just slightly off, but in a nearly perfect pattern.. just.. one inch left. I pulled my Glock out, and stuck it to Sol's head, just behind the ear, and pulled the trigger, for a coup de gras. He went still after that.

Cody: "The prisoner is dead." He said, looking to me.

I moved over to the firing line, and took Flash's rifle, then the casing off the ground, and inspected them. The casing had a small crack in it near the neck.. so did the next one.. and the next.. all of them did. The ammunition was faulty. I shrugged and handed the Sherman back to him.

K: "Bad ammo. Pull that Lot from storage and have it sent back to Appleloosa Arsenal for testing." I advised.

Twilight: "Well.. it's over.." She lowered her head, and rubbed up against her mother.

Twilight Velvet: "It is." She sighed, and shook her head, pulling Spike AND Sunset closer to her. "Sunset, I may.. I'm not your mother or father, but.."

Sunset: "I'd rather you be my mom than.." She hugged her. "..better'n nothing.."

K: "Alright everyone. Remember their final words. They have no respect for anyone but themselves - they didn't care about anyone else, even their own children. Don't let that darkness into your hearts!" I addressed the crowd. "Flash, you may dismiss your squad."

Me? I wanted my mare. Badly.

Part 4: Reconstruction Reconstitution

TIME: 11:13 ERST
DATE: War Day 852/6 Octavius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Ponyville, Erie, Equestria


The town was being rebuilt. When I arrived, three Engineer Companies were joining with local craftsponies, and civilian construction crews, to re-lay the town in its entirety. Mayor Mare was frazzled, running between plots of land and trying to organize everything.

We pulled up in military trucks and got out. I went over to Mare, and just pulled her into a hug.

K: "Mayor Mare." I rocked her back and forth on her hooves. "When's the last time you slept?"

Mayor Mare: "AH! K! Ah.. ah.. what.. day is today?" She slumped into my arms.

K: "Cody!" I called to him.

Dr. Allcome came forwards from the trucks with a pack full of replacement medical supplies. He took a good look at Mayor Mare and shook his head.

Cody: "Mayor, I'm going to give you a light sedative. You NEED to rest. I can already tell you've pushed yourself entirely too far!" He snorted and dug in his medicine bag.

Mayor Mare: "N-Nhh. But, I have to..!" Cody sticking her with a needle, cut her off. "..oh, horsefeathers."

She just gave up, and I picked her up and carried her towards one of the shelters. Most of the town was in some stage of reconstruction, but I noticed City Hall hadn't been touched except to reinforce the structure to keep it from collapsing.

Golden Harvest-Script: "K!" She moved right over and hugged me, directing me to a cot to put Mayor Mare on. "Oh, my gosh, I'm so glad to see you!"

I set the mayor down, and I instantly got hugs from Scoots, Sweetie Belle, and Applebloom.. and a sight of someone I hadn't met, yet. She was wearing an ROTC Uniform, and had the Apple family looks.

Babs Seed: "General K? ROTC Cadet-Sergeant Babs Seed, nice'ta meet'cha! We're cousins." She saluted casually.

I stood and made an insistance on a proper salute.

She stood straight up, clicked her hooves together, slowly raised her right foreleg to her brow, and locked it there.

I stood at attention, and rendered the same paced salute, then broke it first.

She did likewise.

K: "Cadet Sergeant." I nodded to her, noting she had a THICK Manehattan Upper East Side accent.

Babs: "General." She nodded smartly. "I'm graduatin' in a few months, and I'd like to apply to join your General Staff." She looked over, seeing Applejack enter. "Miss Applejack." She stood stiffly, but didn't initiate a salute.

Applejack: "...whul! LOOK AT'CHEW!" She beamed and zoomed over to her. "Babs! By golly!" She hugged her. "An' here I wuz worried y'all might'a turned out'a be a bad seed're somethin'." She looked at me. "Mah family in Manehattan.. oh.. back jes' before y'showed up, sent her down here fer a bit, ta straighten her out.. I wuzn't sure it'd work.." She lowered her head.

Babs: "It didn't, I'mma be honest, ma'am." She shook her head. "But when th' war stah'ted? I realized I bettah shape up.. I needed'ta do somethin' or I wouldn't have'a future.. nothin' but bein' food're a slave're somethin' so.." She lowered her head and looked up.

K: "Okay. I'll accept your application. You'll be directly squaded up with AJ and the other Elements. Fireteam with Twilight and Spike." I looked at the other three girls.

Applejack: "..while I ain't eager fer this, yeah." She shrugged.

Babs: "Plus, ya' know? I gotta get revenge fer Cousin Braeburn!" She stood haughtily.

K: "No illusions, Babs. You could die out there, or worse." I nodded to her.

Babs: "I know." She lowered her head a tiny bit. "Better'n stickin' aroun' here waitin' fer Tirek'n his goons ta show up."

K: "Are you on Summer Break, right now?" I shrugged a bit.

Babs: "Sure am. Until the 10th of next month." She nodded smartly.

K: "I'll contact your school and have you put on deferrment until we get back from getting the Weather Rock. Hopefully, it won't take us too long." I put my hand on her shoulder. "This is going to be dangerous, you know."

Babs: "I understand." She gave me a determined look.

K: "Applejack, honey.." I started.

Applejack: "Ah'll git her squared 'way." She nodded.

I knew the kids would likely end up in the war, towards the end. I didn't like it, but I knew the possibility was there. Babs was 15 this year. Graduating High School early so she can join up, and join me directly.

Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo were right behind her. But, I knew them.. they'd join, too. If this war lasted as long as I thought it would, they'd be involved at the end. I just didn't want to see them hurt.. even though I knew it was possible.

K: "Harv." I nodded to her.

Golden Harvest-Script: "Yes, K?" She trotted over.

K: "There's something I've been meaning to do for a long time." I reached into my pocket and pulled out a small case. "While each town, each county, each city, forms its own Militia, and each State is responsible for it, the Militia Arm of the Equestrian Ponies must have a leader to coordinate in times of crisis. You've been with me for almost.. almost four years." I pet her mane, more friendly than official, and opened the box. "By the power vested in me by Our Eternal Goddesses, I promote you to the rank of General of the Equestrian Militia, and official Department Officer." I fixed the new stars to her shirt.

She stood there and let the tears flow, before throwing her forelegs around me and hugging me. She knew what this meant - she knew it meant I trusted her as much as I trusted Sacquet or Forest Spirit. That she was FAR more than the simple vegetable seller she'd once been.

She was a leader.

Written Script: "Seems I picked the right mare!" He smiled, as he walked in. "Congratulations, my love." And embraced her.

General Harvest-Script: "K.. thank you." She blushed and wiped her eyes.

K: "You've earned it." I nodded. "Pardon me, though, I hate to promote and run, but I've things on my mind." I patted her mane, and Written's, before departing.

I ended up heading to the farm.

When I got there, I could see that.. well, the main house was already framed and raised. The interior was being worked on by Jim and Ambrosia personally.

They.. made it huge.

K: "Oh.. my goodness!" I paced up, and rest a hand on a barrel.

Jim: "Bossman." He slid down the ladder he was on. "Weddin' gift, r'member?" He smirked, and gave me a one-arm hug.

K: "Ahahha.." I was almost in tears. "I remember." I wiped my eyes. "Brose." I nodded to her.

Ambrosia: "K." She paced over, setting her hammer down. "So. I think you're going to need a replacement fo the library.. and your barn-workshop." She yanked a set of design schematics from her overalls, and rolled them out on the chart table.

Her design was.. interesting. I expected it to look like some magical flower erupting from the Earth as a symbol of Equestria's great mystical powers, and for the Elements of Harmony and all that.

What I got instead was something that looked like a cross between a Princess's small fantasy castle, and a bunker. No walls, but it would have a high tower that would be an effective lookout tower. The main structure itself was oddly shaped, and had a unicorn-like horn stretching from it, towards the main road.

It had a clear division between research areas, quarters for staff, a workshop for myself, a headquarters area, and even office spaces. PLUS, it looked like something out of a story book. It had embellishments on the front, the sides..

K: "This is amazing." I tapped the blueprint. "Consider this design purchased by The Crown. Begin construction when feasible."

Jim: "You got it, Bossman." He nodded.

Ambrosia: "The town should be done being rebuilt in another two weeks or less." She shrugged. "Magic and Pegasi labor makes things go easier. Mayor Mare took the opportunity to re-lay the town plan and make things a little less.. congested?" She gestured a bit, and showed me the town's new layout.

It was, indeed, more standard. The down town area was laid out in rectangles, with one row of structures near where the old town center used to be, being the main commerical row. The old circular center was now a pentagon, with wide avenues. The chevron-shaped end of the pentagon was an open space backed by walls, for mobile merchants. The center was a park area.

Downtown was then organized in rectangular blocks from the center. The first set of blocks parallel to the two roads leading to the town center, then the next set intersecting. This was all contained in a square. Out from that were the houses. The first ring from the commercial center of town were half-acre (60 meter long, 30 meter wide) plots. Then, a horizontal row on each side that were 3/4 acre plots (60 x 50). The plots were arranged in straight lines, in a grid system. At the corners of the grid were expanded lots for.. well.. richer families. But, even those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder would get a half acre of property and a house.

The new hospital, the existing City Hall, new Gendarmes building, fire station, militia headquarters, and all of that would be "behind" the main commercial center of the town. Major roads were wide, while neighborhood streets were more narrow. Two diagonal roads spread from the center of the town pentagon, enabling rapid movement. It was a pretty good plan, given that it replaced an archaic hodgepodge of straight rows interrupted by non-through streets and dead ends.

It also accounted for the town growing in population to double its current level.

K: "This is magnificent." I nodded. "I see that the Old Library grounds were expanded to make this new building."

Ambrosia: "It's like a mini-palace, really." She shrugged. "Given that you'll be here with Princess Luna a lot, and.. well.. you're the Commander of the whole Military, we felt this was fitting."

K: "I see.. the orchard got mostly replanted.." I just.. stared at it.

The miscellanious Apple kin were busy tending to it. Applejack RAN up to me, just seeing this for the first time.

Applejack: "OH! HONEY!" She hugged me so tight, she popped my back!

K: "AH! Ooooo.. feels good." I hugged her back. "It's a miracle."

Granny came meandering up, and gave me a big ol' granny hug, too.

Granny Smith: "Well.. here she is! Donations, transplants, everything! Amazin' isn't it?" She cackled.

K: "Sure is." I shrugged, as my kids came up - Arthur was in Pomme's saddle bags, and Liberty was in Starlight Mint's.

Rolfe: "Hey, dad!" He hugged me tightly. "I've been doing my best!"

K: "I see that!" I smirked. "Sorry I wasn't here." I shrugged.

Rolfe: "It's okay. We heard you got the bad guys." He beamed. "I knew my dad was the best!"

Applejack: "Heh.. y'all c'n say that again, son." She gave him and the other kids a big hug.

Koringo: "Papa 'n Mama.. kill! All de ebil!" She tapped her little hooves on the ground. "We be safe! Papa come home, Mama come home."

Pomme Florale: "We are glad you are safe, PaPa." She beamed.

Starlight Mint: "Rolfe's really coming along, dad!" She puffed her chest out. "He's been learning how to Engineer, now!"

K: "I'm impressed." I shrugged. "Your cousin, Babs, will be on my staff while we look for the Weather Rock."

Pomme: "Oui? Good! Family watches family! Und we are all family!" She beamed.

Granted, dinner that night was Cowboy open fire stew, but it felt like the best thing I'd eaten in ages. We had tents set up, and we rested. I ended up with Rolfe and the babies. Wedged into a semi-circle of tents all together.. I reflected on how nice it was to just enjoy whatever time I got with them.

Part 5: Location, Location, Location

TIME: 11:31 ERST
DATE: War Day 853/7 Octavius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Ponyville, Erie, Equestria


It was unnaturally hot today.. I was reminded how pressing the Weather Rock situation was. Twilight was in the hastily constructed shed near the Library's crater, going through damaged tomes and items that had been collected and deposited there.

K: "Find anything?"

Twilight: "Sunset and I found a couple of books that mention it.. well.. parts of books.." She sighed, frustratedly.

Sunset: "Nothing concrete, just yet.." She sideglanced Twilight. "..she never did learn shorthanding her notes." And smiled, handing me a notepad.

Twilight: "Well.. I preferred more verbose notes.. sometimes I would forget my own shorthand.." She blinked, and shrugged.

K: "You two getting along?" I asked in a more Daddy voice.

Sunset: "..like the sisters we should have been.." She said, hauntingly, almost like an echo.

Twilight: "..yeah." She looked up a moment, then went back to her work.

K: "You two have been through so much.." I lowered my head, paced over and scratched them both up and down the sides of their heads.

Sunset: "...mmmm! Okay, this is one thing pony form has over human." She nuzzled a bit.

Twilight: "Oh, I agree!" She beamed. "I remember when K first got here, and I was asking him questions about Earth and things, and he'd just sit and pet my mane for hours." She sighed. "I hope we can go back to that.. that was nice."

K: "Yeah, and your mane needs extra work, now. You're going to need to change shampoos, too." I smirked, and read the notes.

The notes, in shorthand, were all the clues they had to the location of the Weather Rock, an ancient item once used by Unicorns to control the weather in the absence of Pegasi Ponies. It really did exist - the question was, would it work for all of Equestria, or would we have gaps in coverage, or what.

As for the location, after the War of Reunification in which Celestia became a despot, the Unicorns decided to hide it, so it would not be used to harm their newly re-united friends. This was a simple list of clues, a thousand years old. It was sent to the north, it was buried, and it was hidden where only a fool would find it.

Where only...

...a fool...

K: "DUSTY!!" I leaned out the shed and yelled at the top of my lungs.

Twilight: "What is it, K!?" She raised her head, and looked at me.

Dusty, Applejack, and Fluttershy came over, as they'd all been together, and my voice DID sound rather.. urgent. After a moment, Cosmic, Norfy, and Gaze appeared from the sides.

K: "Dusty, how many Iron Pyrite mines are.. NORTH of Canterlot and Ponyville?" I cocked a brow.

Dusty: "..just that one in Quirtbeck that we-" She looked at me, then snatched the notepad. "Fool's-"

Norfy: "-Gold!" He finished her sentence, the two looking at each other, and grinning.

K: "What'cha wanna bet?" I smirked. "Norfy, get a team together. Elements stay HERE, got it?" I looked at Twilight and the others.

Twilight: "I could go.." She blinked.

K: "Yeah, I suppose that'd be a good idea.." I shrugged. "..everyone else remains here, just in case we have any other surprises or we end up being wrong - I want someone around checking through EVERYTHING, just in case." I pointed.

Norfy: "Alright, K." He nodded, and off he took.

Cosmic: "I'll get supplies and logistics sorted." He shrugged, and departed.

Gaze: "Ah'll git us some backup from th' Legion or Canidan Rangers're some'un." He trotted off.

Cody: "I suppose.. I could come with." He paced up and smirked. "If you don't mind, of course."

K: "You know, Doc, you've come a LOOONG way from the nervous mess you were in Manehattan." I patted his back. "Any time."

Cody: "Thanks to you, K." He nodded slightly.

Sweetheart: "You'll need a nurse." She cocked a brow to Cody.

Teddy: "And you'll need a sniper, since Rarity isn't going." He nodded smartly to me.

K: "Talk to Norfy." I gestured to him.

Twilight: "I'll gather all the magical things that I can, and get Katrina. I want a backup magi." She sighed, and took off.

Dusty: "This is gonna be fun." She smirked.

It looked like another adventure was in the offing. Again, we would likely have at least some support and assistance from our network of friends, but this was going to be a lot of grunt work, especially if that cave or false mine or whatever, was more complex than it appeared..
