Part 1: Friends from the Rising Sun

TIME: 18:04 NCT
DATE: War Day 910/5 Decemus, 1004 C.S. (Local)
LOCATION: Aboard HINMS Yamato, Riau Strait, Dutch East Indies


I was set down on the port side bridge wing with Sunset, Elsie and Teeka, by the Pegasi. Two sailors threw blankets over us, and escorted us inside.

Rojin Roshi: "Young ferra!" He tittered, a twinkle in his eye.

Bushin Senshi: "K." He paced over to me, and bowed.

I bowed back, and pulled him into a hug.

K: "I.." I was very emotional - once more, I thought I was as good as dead, and everyone would die with me. "..Senshi."

Emperor Daishiro no Ken: "K----!" He trotted up, and hugged me as well - much to the absolute shock of his officers and enlisted ponies (after all, one should consider themselves BLESSED to be able to even look him in the face - and here was a Gaijin getting a HUG!?). "My dear friend!" He gripped my shoulders, and shook me, laughing.

K: "Haeh.. heh.. ONE MINUTE later, and.." I just shook my head, smiling with tears of joy. "My friends..!" I sniffled. "Ah. How rude of me. This is Sunset Shimmer, Teeka, and Elsie Bon Voyage. Susnet is the new Element of Magic." I gestured to them, overcome with joy.

Sunset: "Emperor." She bowed her head.

Elsie: "Emperor. Generals." She bowed as well.

Teeka: "Ah! Big Neighpon Pony!" She cheekily bowed quickly, and popped up with a toothy grin. "Am Teeka. Am Aide to Great Human who fight The One Over All!"

K: "She.. uh.." I chuckle-cried a bit. "..she's defected." I shrugged.

Princess Yuuki: "Uncle!" She trotted up and hugged me as well. "I am glad you are safe!" She quickly pressed a hoof to my side - only then did I realize I was wounded - and used her magic to heal my wound completely. "Come. We can take care of this fight. Let us do what you have taught us to do. You need rest and food." She gestured at the ship. "Yamato is Untouchable!"

Emperor no Ken: "Hai!" He nodded sharply. "We can handle these.. rabble.." He nodded to the bridge windows.

I could see the last two enemy battleships trying to flee, and aircraft chasing them down. Armed with torpedoes. And dive bombs.

Everything I'd been trying to do, they had absorbed and done. I let Yuuki escort us to the ward room.

K: "When we have an opening, Yuuki, I need to get back on shore - we have friends there we need to rescue." I nodded to her. "You.. you look good."

Yuuki: "Thank you, Uncle." She smiled. "I'm an officer, officially, now. Shi-kyu jo. Imperial Army."

K: "That's like a 2nd Lieutenant - it stands for, roughly translated, 4th Grade Comapny Officer." I shrugged at Elsie and Sunset.

Teeka: "You very pretty!" She beamed a grin. "Teeka.. smell tasty fishes!" She said, as we entered the ward room.

I could feel Yamato rock slightly, every time the main guns fired. She was a stable ship, but those guns were monsters. I smiled. I knew that, at this range, each shot was a kill shot on an enemy vessel.

Yuuki: "Please." She gestured to the table, and we sat.

They had prepared, essentially, a small feast for us. A chef was even there, to personally put together whatever we asked for.

K: "Toro tuna and some of that Wagyu." I pointed. "Oh, and a bit of that salmon. Absolutely no Wasabi."

Chef: "Hai." He nodded.

Gorlamb came in about then, in the same uniform as Yuuki, but with three silver bars on his shoudlerboards.

K: "Gorlamb." I nodded.

Gorlamb: "General." He smiled a bit.

K: "Your cousin is King of the Griffons, now." I smiled broadly.

Sunset: "Oh, yeah? This is Gorcat's cousin!?" She beamed a grin. "Sunset."

Gorlamb: "Oh, no kidding?" He sat next to me. "Nice. I'm Gorlamb. Former P-O-W, turned Officer." He gave me a nod. "I'm the Emperor's Staff Officer, now. He's going to want to know how you want to play this." He shrugged.

K: "Simple. Wreck the fleet they have here, pick a spot for a counter-invasion, and hit it once we're secured properly." I nodded. "Exact details once we have some breathing room." I shrugged. "We need to chase off the invaders, of course."

Gorlamb: "We've landed two battalions on the island - they'll take care of 'em." He smirked.

Sunset: "..oh, this tea is amazing." She sipped at it. "Sorry, I.. uh.. don't know the proper Ja-ah.. Neighponese way to drink it." She shrugged. "I spent four years in a human world - Tirek managed to temporarily kill Twilight, but she came back.. just.. she couldn't be the Element of Magic any more, so, I am."

Gorlamb: "Old habits." He nodded. "The Emperor intends to give you full command - but we have new capabilities. I'm supposed to brief you on them."

K: "I saw some of them - you guys have a carrier?" I smirked as my food was served.

Gorlamb: "Yep. Super sized, it's built off of a Yamato-class hull." He smirked. "Thickly armored, too."

K: "The Equestrian Fleet should be here soon, too." I nodded. "I want to take one objective, if possible, before they get here. And the Dutch will be here after Equestria is. I'm hoping to get Jakarta liberated by then, and the Dutch can just take care of the mop-up." I shrugged a bit. "Their rifles rely on manual hand loading rounds. They're like Shermans, but.. a bit of a downgrade, they never have enough mags to go around."

Gorlamb: "We can help with that. We brought a couple of Stores Ships with us, with everything from weapons to chewing gum." He smirked. "Those Dragon Food Islands - there was more than one - made sure we ain't starving." He motioned for the Chef to bring me a slice of Banana..

..that was the size of a Large Pizza.

K: "Oooohhh.." I dug in, respectfully, and enjoyed it with the other foods. "..good stuff." I nodded to him. "I am glad to see you, Gorlamb."

Gorlamb: "Ehh.. it's been a time." He smirked. "How's Sigmask?"

K: "Command Sergeant-Major of the Corps, now." I grinned at him.. but I could hear enough to know the guns had fallen silent. "Seems like the fight is over."

About then, Emperor no Ken and an admiral came in.

VADM Chuichi Neighgumo: "I am Vice-Admirah Chuichi Neighgumo." He bowed to me. "General K."

K: "Admiral." Out of respect, I both stood and bowed to him. "Please." I invited him to the table. "Daishiro.. again, man.." I shook my head.

Emperor no Ken: "After what you have done for us ahl." He shook his head. "I can never repay."

K: "Your friendship is more than enough." I smiled. "Admiral. I presume the fight is over and we have the enemy beneath us entirely?" I smirked a bit - a touch of egotistical understatement on their behalf.

Adm. Neighgumo: "Hai." He smirked a bit. "I must ahrso personarahry thank you - a certain Monk at Miaco, my brother, torhd me what you had done to save us ahl." And, like most Neighponese, he had a difficult time with L's.

K: "His prayers helped." I humbly deflected. "That and the courage of so many that willingly follow this strange alien." Again, humbleness when referring to myself.

Emperor no Ken: "And you see, he does undahstand our ways." He smirked. "As I had said." He looked to me. "We made a point to chase down each enemy vesserh and sink it. Besides the ones ahead of you, we also had taken anothah dozen ships from the frhlanks, that ahttempted to block us from getting to you. I apo'rogise for our rhlateness."

K: "It can't be helped. Tirek's forces may be dishonorable rabble, but they are not to be underestimated for their fanatical devotion and fighting spirit." I shrugged. "I'm sure Admiral Duerpaard would thank you personally, if he had lived. Can you get ahold of Commandeur Roos? She would be nextmost senior."

Adm. Neighgumo: "Hai. We have." He nodded sharply. "She wirl arrive soon."

K: "Excellent. Then, now that I've had some fine tea and food, we need to get ashore and help our other friends. Once these rabble have been swept from the shores, we can relax and bury our dead." I shrugged. "And, I need a weapon." I smirked.


TIME: 18:37 NCT
LOCATION: Kawal Town, Dutch East Indies


I was landing with a section from the Neighponese Special Naval Landing Force. Neighponese Navy Special Forces. Real professionals. Their Type-33 SMG's had suppressors on them, and their rifles were outfitted with scopes. I had the Neighponese Bradley - the Type 33 Shugekiryu - with a Type-34 "Ryu no Yari" (Dragon Lance) Grenade Launcher (a copy of the Gavin) mounted to it.

And a proper set of tactical clothes. From one of my uniforms I'd left behind, the Emperor had the forethought to have clothes prepared for me, just in case of this very situation.

We slipped off the motor boat at the shore by the 2nd Defensive Line at the town itself, and I personally led these 24 Special Operators, led by Yanjiro of all ponies, up the shore.

K: "Watch for ambushers! Yanjiro - take the corner over there. STEELA! WHERE ARE YOU!?" I called out.

Now, to be fair, half the town was on fire, and while the defensive line had held, there were many wounded. Maud was immediately relieved by two Pharmacist's Mates from Yamato and a litter team, evacuating the casualties back to the motor boats.

Maud: "..we did sustain many casualties, K." She looked at the Neighponese special operators. "But, Boulder is glad his faith in you was well placed." She was about to move off, with the wounded, but paused and gripped my neck, pulling me down eye level with her. "I understand. Now. Why my sister loved you like she did. You.. you are what family should be." And poked my nose with the tip of her snout, before running back off.

Yanjiro: "..was that Maud Pie?" She looked at me, then Maud as she left.

K: "Yeah.. ah.. she's not dead, Yanjiro." I shrugged. "Come on."

Sunset: "I'm just glad to get properly geared up." She slid her Kreuger into place on a sandbag and pounded off several aimed shots.

A Porcine crashed through a building to our left, only to be hosed down immediately by two Neighponese Special Operators. When he fell, one of them made sure of his demise by stabbing him in the back of the head with a long knife.

K: "Move the platoon up." I pointed. "By squad. We relieve the Dutch and evacuate them to the Fleet. Come on. By the numbers."

Yanjiro: "Of course, K." She smiled, and harshly barked her orders, with her Platoon nodding affirmative.

I walked more or less in the center of them, still keeping low, but not crawling or cowering. I had real professionals with me, now. MY troops - or, close enough. NEIGHTO troops. This was demonstrated well when a line of Troggles charged through at the far side of town, and moved in a line across from us.

When the lead Troggle spotted us and moved to a tactical crouch, motioning for his unit to do the same, the SNLF Troops were already in position, and started firing first. I took a knee, and flipped up the grenade sight. Sunset covered me with a flame shield as I aimed and fired an impact fuse grenade, that landed between three of them and detonated.

I saw an SNLF Pony wheel around and kick-return a thrown grenade, which was caught by a Troggle and exploded once it did. Another, caught in a reload, whipped her neck, only for a long knife to fly from her jaw, and strike a Troggle in the neck.

I smirked.. the enemy was confouded, meeting real pros for once, and they were falling back to regroup. Perfect chance for a bayonet charge.

K: "YANJIRO! THEY'RE WEAK AT HOOF-TO-CLAW!" I pointed, as I pulled the Sword of Rainbow's Light, now that we had them on the back foot.

Yanjiro: "TENNOUHEIKA BANZAIIIII!" She screamed, and she drew her Kaiguntou, as the rest of her ponies screamed in refrain.

I then held my arm out for Elsie and Sunset to just wait, as Yanjiro led them in a hoof-long charge into the enemy. As before, the Troggles showed almost ineptitude at hoof-to-claw combat, and I watched with no small measure of glee as the SNLF Troops righteously cut them down with bayonets and knives, with Yanjiro doing a flourish, jump, down-cut, and decapitating a running Troggle, sending his head flying, and his body running three more steps before falling over.

Sunset: "Damn! They're GOOD!" She smiled.

Elsie: "No kidding! HOLY CELESTIA, SHE DISEMBOWELED THAT ONE!" She held her hoof over her mouth.

Indeed, Yanjiro did a running kneel-slide into a two-knee 360 spin that ended with her slicing open the intestines of the last Troggle. She stood, flourished her Kaiguntou, snapped it to the saya, and as she snapped it home, the Troggle went from its intestines being spilled, to being completely cut in half, falling over, her final cut having gone all the way through him.

Yanjiro: "Enemy defeated! REGROUP! And watch your sectors!" She reminded her troops, as she stepped over to me. "General!" She bowed a bit. "Were you available, I would have taken this invitation to gain personal honor, as a flirt."

K: "You always were a solider, Yanjiro, and a damn good one." I pat her shoulder. "Definitely embodies the Bushido spirit."

She smiled sweetly at me, and motioned to get going.

More friends, more magic, and safety in numbers. Now, to clean up this place..

It took us about half an hour to get to Steela and Lightning's position, and as soon as we did, the Neighponese SNLF took the places of the Dutch defenders, with the lull in battle. I directed them to head to the river's edge and get on a transport.

I stepped up as Steela and Lightning Dust approached. LD was sporting a bandage on her right upper foreleg, and one of the SNLF Medics immediately moved over to check it. Steela was bleeding from her rear leg and flank. Both had soot on their faces. Steela was.. neutral-faced. LD was a bit shook up.

K: "The Neighponese have arrived. Come on, we're getting back to the Yamato." I gestured.

Steela: "When.. I saw.. Utrecht sink, I.." She blushed and lowerd her head. "..I am sorry, K."

Lightning Dust: "Everyone thought you were dead. But, Steela rallied them. She.. kept it in check, yanno?"

K: "Kept it in check?" I looked at her.

Steela: "..part of me did not think you were dead, but, the thought you might be.." She lowered her head, and threw her forelegs over me. "..I wanted to go into a Berzerker Rage." She shrugged as the SNLF Medics moved to her and patched her leg.

Lightning: "I told her that'd be a bad idea." She frowned. "General.. part.. part of the other reason I went AWOL is.." She sighed. "..I." She shuffled her hooves. "I kinda.. I'm kinda responsible for someone almost dying. I.. I.. they were qualifying on the F/A-1, and.." She shrugged a bit. "..I knew they had problems seeing properly. Some.. something about being up high and getting dizzy. Soemthing in the ear. And.. I pushed them. I pushed them to qualify, so I'd get recognized as the Flight Leader for getting all my pilots qual'd fastest.. they crashed." She lowered her head. "It was my fault, and I was more afraid I'd get found out as the cause, than I was worried about their safety."

K: "So, you ran." I nodded, and put a hand on her shoulder. "And, now?"

Lightning: "I realize I was wrong, now. I was stupid. I was self absorbed. I made a mistake." She lowered her head. "There's more important things out there, than my own ego." She sighed. "I'm sorry."

K: "I forgive you. You've grown a lot in the last week." I shrugged. "Come on, Lieutenant. Time to get some rest."

People can change. They grow and evolve. Sometimes, it takes a lot to realize what we've done wrong. Sometimes, we need friends to help us through it.

I had a feeling LD would be just fine, now.

LOCATION: Aboard HINMS Yamato, Dutch East Indies


I stretched, as I got out of bed. I had been absolutely exhausted before laying down - all that fighting, from dawn to past dusk, and with only a quick bite to eat. I trudged to the bathing room, only to be reminded that the Japanese bathe.. differnetly.. from Westerners. The old move "Mr. Baseball" - I'd loved it as a kid - it had shown me how to do this.

Great film, by the way, a really nice Baseball film with a RomCom B-Story. Plus, hey, Tom Selleck.

Right now, I kinda wished he was here instead of me. Better acting chops. More confidence. Maybe he could be a better hype man than I was, encourage these ponies. Either way, though, I'd carry on. These ponies needed leadership and understanding. I would never feel like I deserved the rank and status I had, but I swore I'd use it to help them. No matter how. No matter what it meant. Even if I died in the process.

Time to get clean, though.

I got down and started cleaning myself.. only to feel warm hooves on my back.

Sunset: "..Steela's passed out in Sickbay." She slid around and into my lap. "I want dick." She pushed her lips into mine. "If I'm going to be part of this herd, I want Stallion Privileges." And slid her forelegs over me. "Come on, let's get filthy-clean." And she grinned at me.

It'd been some time since I'd had some intimacy, other than Luna in my dreams the last few nights. Feeling her straddle me? Knowing how good sex with her was BEFORE the Alicorn-ness?

We made out sloppy style. Just.. both of us wanting some closeness. Her wings flexed and stretched, sliding around me like feathery fingers, and pulling me closer. I was inside her before I realized that we were really doing this, under the warm spray of the shower.

She was.. VERY warm.. inside. It felt more amazing than usual to sink into her depths.

I wasn't even sure how long we went at it. The goal wasn't even getting each other off, it was just.. intimacy, for intimacy's sake. We both finished, but it took us.. longer than usual. Sunset then set about pampering me - that whole 'mutual grooming' thing. And I cleaned her up likewise before rinsing off.

When I exited the bathing area and fetched my clothes, Teeka was there, and staring at my nakedness with a nonchalant look.

Teeka: "That be mine. Some day." And she simply slid off her bunk, and went to get herself cleaned up, her tone sarcastically demanding, insisting. "Soooome day, Teeka show Great K.." She kicked her feet a bit. "Teeka good at taking.. dicktation.." She fixed me with a smirk before vanishing into the bath room.

Sunset: "I.. uh." She blushed. "..I swore she was asleep!"

K: "She was. An hour and a half ago." I smirked, and dressed.

We went to breakfast, with me in a.. well, Daishiro had made sure the tailor he employed, made me something close to my older formal uniform. The boots were a bit tight, but they fit. The breeches were very much breeches and not standard human pants. The collared shirt was a good fit, and the tunic coat that went with it was cut just right. It was all in black, though, but it did have the NEIGHTO Flash on the shoulder, and a stitched version of my Sun/Moon rank pin.

Commandeur Roos was there, along with several of the ship's captains, and Kolonel Wolfheze (who had a bandaged foreleg).

K: "Everyone." I took a seat across from Roos, and nodded to Daishiro as he came in and sat as well. "Roos." I shrugged. "You're the boss, now."

Codr. Roos: "Indeed. Ah, I suppose I should call you General, now? Your friends are here." She was.. slightly off put.. like we'd caught her lacking.

K: "Just K." I shrugged. "How do you want to proceed? Your troops need rest. They're exhausted."

Codr. Roos: "..yes, they are." She lowered her head. "And Admiraal Duerpaard...." She frowned, and looked down at the table.

K: "Went down with his ship, like a true hero would." I gave her and even look as I was served Omurice.. oo.. with real tomato ketchup! "Thanks, Daishiro." I smiled. "How'd you know?"

Emperor no Ken: "Appurljack." He smirked back. "An just because I am the Emprah, does not mean I do not eat de same food as my people."

I paused so everyone could snap their Hashi (chopsticks). Roos and the other Dutch officers were also given forks. I.. intentionally set mine aside.. and snapped my Hashi, looking at Yuuki and Daishiro, then clapped my hands together in thanks, with the hashi under my thumb, and bowed my head.

K: "Thank you, My Lord, for giving me the gift of life another day, despite the challenges of The Enemy, and for this nourishing meal among my close friends." I smiled a bit, and looked at Daishiro. "Gotta add a little 'me' in there. Especially after last night."

Emperor no Ken: "Haha.. ov course!"

K: "Roos.. Karel was a good stallion." I looked up to her. "He is worthy of every praise. He was starting to learn the tricks of real combat command. He was smart, and he cared about his subordinates. I care about them, too." I nodded. "I also worry about the civilians. Tirek's troops are going to eat those poor Deer. I know it. They've done it with Ponies. Deer is closer to a meat animal. I want your endorsement to take the Neighponese fleet and start a landing on Sumatra, and start trying to save them."

Codr. Roos: "My.. endorsement?" She looked puzzled.

K: "This is your command, now. Your islands. I don't want to just take action without an invitation to do so. You're not yet a part of NEIGHTO. We may be at war with Tirek, but that would be little better than an unwanted invasion of your territory." I nodded to her.

Codr. Roos: "..yes." She nodded, considering the implications of her rank and station. "You're right. I am in charge." She shrugged. "I would prefer Dutch troops lead the invasion proper, but.." She looked at Admiral Neighgumo. "..I think sticking in a relief valve - a.. reconnaisence in force - on Sumatra, might be a good idea. At least to give the civilians some place to run TO." And she shrugged. "Emperor, Your Grace, how many refugees could your fleet assist?"

Emperor no Ken: "Wif de supply ships we have, several thousands until the Equestrian fleet arrives.. and yours. More as our baggage train arrives. Five more stores ships, and a hospital ship." He nodded.

Adm. Neighgumo: "We have sufficient ground troops to.. make a very decent sized rerlief varhlve for a few days, untirhl your troops recover and you can reorganzie them for a proper offensive. We also have arms with us - NEIGHTO Standard - and would like to offer them to your troops." He nodded respectfully to Kolonel Wolfheze.

Kol. Wolfheze: "We accept these gifts with utmost gratitude." He bowed a little to the Admiral. "I will be the very first to confess that Dutch small arms are not.. up to NEIGHTO standard by any means, and we do need the help, thank you." And he nodded to me. "I am sure General K.. or Kolonel K.." He smirked at me. "..would be willing to train my remaining Marines in their use."

K: "I would relish the chance. They're all exceedingly brave." I nodded to him. "That's.. one thing that's always gotten to me." I shrugged. "Even though warfare like this is an utterly foreign concept to you all - that you're all so peaceful and kind - and yet, with this war, I've seen so much courage.." I smiled a bit. "..everyone says I'm the master of warfare. I'm just good at theory. We wouldn't be here without all those ponies and others out there, giving it their all."

Emperor no Ken: "HAI!" He slapped the table.

K: "Admiral, Emperor, Senshi, I will leave the execution of the landing plan to you. Meanwhile, I'll help get the Dutch Marines reorganized, with Kolonel Wolfheze's help." I gestured.

Emperor no Ken: "Hai. A fine prlan." He smiled a bit. "We can show you how far we have come."

K: "The honor is mine, to serve alongside such courage and dedication to friendship." I smiled.

A fine breakfast. I could tell Roos and Wolfheze were put more at ease than before, seeing how humble the Emperor was, and how reassuring his officers were.

Now.. I'd let the Dutch Marines rest another day, before retraining them as NEIGHTO Marine Infantry.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Retreading

TIME: 11:32 NCT
DATE: War Day 911/6 Decemus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: NMS Icihiro Maru, Riau Strait, Dutch East Indies

I was getting aboard the Neighponese Merchant Ship, to address the Dutch troops evacuated from Poto and Bintam. Of the two Regiments - 720 troops - 318 were left alive and in fighting condition. 87 were seriously injured. 63 were not injured seriously, but would need medical care. 252 dead, or 35% fatalities.

To say nothing of our losses at sea. Utrecht, De Ryuter, Zaen, Arnhem and Veendam were all sunk. It might be possible to refloat the Arnhem, it was sunk on a sandbar. Utrecht was at the bottom of the strait. Zaen was blown to pieces. De Ryuter lost its bow before going down. Veendam had exploded from concentrated cruiser fire from four ships. Most ships were lost with all hands, or nearly all - casualties were very high, regardless.

It ate at me.

K: "Kolonel." I gestured to Kolonel Wolfheze. "Let the troops know I want them to rest for two days. Then, we begin weapon and tactic training along NEIGHTO lines. Once we do, I want your 12 best remaining soldiers, regardless of rank." I nodded to the troops on the deck.

Kol. Wolfheze: "Of course." He called the troops around and made this announcement in Dutch.

I could see the relief in their faces. Some of them had bags under their eyes. I spotted Lt. Bemoste Eik. He looked worn through. Once the announcement was over, and an early lunch was distributed, I went over to him and sat down.

K: "Eik." I patted his shoulder. "I'm glad to see you."

2lt. Eik: "Kolonel." He stared at the 12-inch (305mm) long slice of orange (Dragon Food Island fruit, apparently), rice, and various other lunch bits on the tray from our Neighponese  friends. "I.. and two others." He shook his head.

I leaned over, and pulled him into a hug. A tight one.

K: "If I could have died four years ago, and prevented all of this, I would have." I said, petting his mane.

Bemoste: "..thank you." He leaned into it, and accepted the comfort I offered.

K: "You're a good stallion, Eik." I patted his neck, and released.

Bemoste: "They.. were my friends, Kolonel." He stared at the deck. "I trained with them. I still recall.. Houten.. saying she would be a great hero. Come back to her sister and parents with a chest full of medals." He chuckled derisively, painfully. "Now.. only two are left. And Vernis will lose his leg. Duig.. she will be okay. Her wounds are minor."

K: "Welcome to the pain of command." I said staring straight ahead. "I have thousands of faces in my head. Thousands. Every one of them, a casualty in this war. Mostly soldiers. Mosly."

Bemoste: "How.. do you deal?" He looked at me, suddenly realizing what I'd said.

K: "By promising myself I'll protect all the rest. And I will do anything that I can to bring them home. But moreso, that I will kill Tirek, so he can NEVER return, and do WORSE next time." I scowled.

Bemoste: "..thank you." He sat up, and started eating. "I shall take the same oath."

The pain of command, of leading, doesn't lessen.. should never lessen.. the higher in rank you ascend. Every general, every admiral, should know this pain. So they are driven to make the best choices possible, to make that pain as small as it can be.

We had now been training them to NEIGHTO Standards for four days. An accellerated program, I added in some field exercises, jsut as I had with Golden and Caramel and them, as most of these "best" ponies were officers.

They didn't just need to learn to soldier, they needed to learn to lead and think in a fight.

K: "Alright, now.." I stood up from the field test targets. "..you secured the objective. Next step." I pointed. "Klopper."

Kapt. Klopper: "We dig in. I have one squad. Set them out to watch." He gestured.

I nodded to him, then looked to Eik.

Bemoste: "We are attacking. Orders were to take this objective. We have done so. However, you did not say if the objective next to us is taken. I see Lightning Dust and Steela are still back there. As we have no left flank, I set three to fire on the right flank target, one to watch the left, one to watch the rear. As leader, I myself call in that we have reached the objective." He gestured as he commented.

K: "Excellent." I smiled. "Jacob.. this is why I insisted on Bemoste." I walked over to him and motioned for LD and Steela to regroup. "You're acting smarter."

Bemoste: "After losing so much, I cannot.. let myself make casual mistakes again." He shrugged, hefting his Neighponese-made Bradley.

K: "Bemoste is right. After you secure your objective, you need to-"

Radio: C> "ALPHA ACTUAL, ALPHA ACTUAL, THIS 'HERE'S ALPHA TWO! PREPARE FOR FLYBY, HONEYBUN!"

Sunset: "Wh-SERIOUSLY!?" She grabbed the mic. C> "Alpha Two, this is Alpha Three.. JACKIE! GIRL, AM I GLAD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE!" She sniffled.

Applejack: C> "Makes two of us, sugarcube. Ground in three minutes."

I just sat down on the nearest rock.

Above me, a LONG flight of F/A-2 Hawks started coming overhead. My eyes were pouring tears. Two weeks. Two weeks since I'd seen her. And I'd cheated death a few times in the interim.

The F/A-2's are two-seater aircraft. As such, the co-pilot or back-seater, can eject from the aircraft seperately from the pilot. I saw my friends do just this. A string of parachutes. But, my knees were weak. I was so overcome with emotion. My NEW friends - Lightning Dust, Steela Oresdottir, Teeka, and Maud - stood and watched as well.

I managed to get up and run over to them.

Webley: "K! K! HOLY CELESTIA!" She was the first one to meet up with me.

Norfy: "K!" He disengaged from the parachute with.. a lot more grace than he had in the Crystal Kingdom.

Gaze: "OI! HOLY CELESTIA, MATE!" He slid out from his 'chute as well.

Cosmic: "K!" He smiled, already untangled.

Dr. Allcome: "Haha! YOU'RE ALIVE!" He beamed a grin.

Then.. her.

I was tackled.

I was splayed out on the ground.

I was being kissed, and I returned those kisses with a maddened passion. We rolled in the grass, me smelling the fresh apple scent of her, her strong legs clinging to me..

Dusty: "K.." She said, when we rolled to her hooves.

I looked up, and pulled her into the hug as well. Soon enough, everyone was hugging.

I managed to componse myself and stand up.. long enough to see a new face. He was a very business-like looking stallion. He was wearing the field combat uniform of Luna's Guards - a subdued/dark Equestrian 6-color camo with a black tactical vest. Devoid of his enchanted armor vestments, he didn't have the 'bat wings' her Guards were shown to have (purely for display purposes).

Interestingly, he had a very noticable scar across his muzzle. Another imperfect pony in a world of perfection. Forest Spirit was right behind him.

Dusk Seeker: "Altern Dusk Seeker, 4th Royal Guards Company, 2nd Squad." He shouldered his Sherman-Spencer. "I.."

Applejack: "He insisted." She shrugged. "He says he's got contacts all 'round these here parts. Jes'n case we had t'go searchin' fer ya." She was.. glued to me.

K: "Altern." I saluted him. "I remember Steelhoof mentioning you.. he.. ah.. kinda suggested that I should've trained you instead."

Dusk Seeker: "My boss." He nodded. "I knew him pretty well." He gestured a bit. "Be honest, sir, I'm tired of taking cover behind a desk."

K: "..welcome." I stuck my hand out. "I need a new Royal Guard Liasion. You're it. No more desk for you."

He looked at my hand, chuckled a tiny bit, and stuck his hoof in it. He didn't smile, though.. and I glanced at Forest Spirit a moment, who just gently nodded his head to the side, like, 'you get it, right?' And I just gave Dusk Seeker a smile.

K: "I mean it. This is a fightin' outfit." I nodded.

Dusk Seeker: "Then I hope to serve Her Majesty.. righteously." He nodded a bit.

Forest Spirit: "The fleet will be here in a few hours." He stepped up, with Redheart, both of them in combat gear, and made his report. "Luna is with us." He nodded a bit, stepping to Kolonel Wolfheze. "Commandant Forest Spirit, Commander, Equestrian Marine Corps. And my wife, Captain Redheart, NEIGHTO Command Advisory Group." And stuck out his hoof.

Kol. Wolfheze: "Kolonel Jacob Wolfheze. Commander of the.. East Indies Marine Regiment." He shrugged a bit, but shook. "We had two, and haven't quite one now."

K: "We're working on training them to NEIGHTO Standard." I said, passing out hugs to everyone. "Rarity. Toola."

Rarity: "Making a lady worry, will put lines on her face, K, darling." She gave me a peck on the cheek.

Dusty: "W.. we did a lot of crying." She shrugged.

Moon Dancer: "..even me." She lowered her head.

K: "Well, we're together, now." I nodded. "Everyone, I want you to meet. Steela Oresdottir, former Valkyrie, that sacrificed her holy position to steal Gungnir from Odin and save my unworthy life. Lightning Dust, formerly of the 12th Aerotransport Squadron from Handscomb. This is Teeka, ah.. a Goblin Female Aide-"

Teeka: "HIYA!" She moved right over to Applejack, and fixed her with a very coy grin. "I want what you get always. Is my Duty as Aide. Is how Goblins do-"

K: "Y-Yeahh.." I shrugged, cutting her off. "..and Maud."

Maud: "..hello, everyone." He stepped forwards. "I know everything." She means about Pinkie. "Is Rose with you?"

Rose: "Ah.. I'm right h-" She stepped forward, only for Maud to put a foreleg around her. "-ey, Sis!" And she absolutely LIT UP. "OMIGOSH! I missed your birthday! And Boulder's! I'm so sorry!"

Maud: "We must reconnect." She said, leading her away.

K: "Ah.. w.. ell.." I shrugged. "That could have gone worse, I suppose." I nodded. "Alright. You know what? Lads? Come here."

Norfy: "Yes, K?" He stepped forwards, smiling. "Something along the lines of 'Train them and teach them your tricks?'"

K: "Exactly." I nodded to them. "Spirit, we need to have a meeting about strategy."

Forest Spirit: "Just say the word." He smiled.

My friends were here. And that means.. Tirek was screwed. More friends, more magic.

K: "So.." I said, with everyone seated. "..we've arrived. It's time we worked as hard as we can to get everything set up." I looked right to Dusk. "What'cher name and your game, my dude?"

Dusk Seeker: "As I said, Dusk Seeker. Steelhoof was my boss for a.. well, he was Guard Commander under Shining Armor.. he knew my reputation. So did Sunshine Smiles. He and I are.. well, not close, but I know him well. I admit, I wanted his position, until he married Princess Cadence. I've wanted an active combat role in this war since it started. Steelhoof picked me among the first six ponies he trained for a reason - I've fought. Somewhat." He shrugged a bit. "There was a Dragon Migration Incident about eight years ago, before you arrived." He shrugged again. "Until I met Commandant Forest Spirit.." He looked down.

K: "You had no idea how you'd be accepted by me." I stated.

Dusk Seeker: "Yes, sir." He nodded. "I've also participated in the Guardpony Games every year since I became a guard, until I briefly retired after the Dragon Migration. I was both a Swordspony and a Lancer." He shrugged a bit. "I'm qualled on all NEIGHTO weapon systems, but I prefer.. precision." He hefted the Sherman-Spencer. "This is Production Number Three. I've had it since the first test units came out, and I was one of the ones selected for testing, along with miss Vinyl Scratch-"

Vy: "He's good, K." She chimed in, hanging off of Dex's foreleg.

K: "Alright." I nodded with a smile. "Well. What have you got for local contact and local intel?" I tilted my head.

Dusk Seeker: "..if I'm not being presumptuous, I think we should skip Sumatra and go right for Jakarta. Sir." He stepped up to the Operations Map. "There's.. something.. on Sumatra that's probably far more dangerous for Tirek right now."

K: "What's that?" I nodded.

Dusk Seeker: "The Nirik, sir." He blinked a bit, and tapped the Sumatran Mountains on the large planning map. "Fierce fire-beasts of the Mountains. Most don't dare go up there for fear of being roasted alive." He looked at the others a moment. "But.." He looked down, then up. "..as I've been told, around here, you take the attitude that Secrets Kill. So.." He nodded to the side a bit. "..the Nirik aren't what Ponies think they are. I've seen what's up there, before the Nirik thing started, as a Colt. They're.. Kirin, sir." He nodded a bit. "I don't rightly know how the Nirik thing started, but the Kirin live there. Anyway, I think they'd be more a hazard to Tirek at the moment, especially if Tirek's commander pokes his hoof in that hornet's nest."

K: "Okay. That'll tie down his forces, for sure. What do you know of Jakarta itself?" I tapped the map.

Dusk Seeker: "Only that we could infiltrate a whole battalion into the city without a problem, if I can get in there and grease some wheels. Sir." He gave a small smirk.

K: "Explain." I nodded, as Forest Spirit leaned in, now VERY interested.

Dusk Seeker: "I know most of the textile merchants there. Through my father." He briefly looked at Rarity. "Miss Rarity knows him - Brindle Spindle of Spindle Fabrics."

Rarity: "YES! Yes, Darling.. indeed." She smiled. "I knew we'd met before.."

Dusk Seeker: "It was a long time ago.. when you first opened your Botique.." He cleared his throat a bit. "..I only returned once in a while to help my father with a few things, I was a Guard by then."

Rarity: "Mm. I can speak to the quality of his fabrics, K, and as he is indeed Brindle's son.." She shrugged. "..he should know almost everyone in Jakarta, Telukbetung, Surabaya, Palembang, and elsewhere."

K: "Excellent. Now, how could they infiltrate a whole battalion?" I nodded to him.

Dusk Seeker: "Right next to town are some ancient ruins and tunnels. They're.. huge. The merchants use them sometimes for extra storage. We could march a battalion of Infantry with vehicle support in there with no problem." He looked to Forest Spirit. "The 1st Marines just got their AAV's. We could land a few kilometers up the coast from the ruins, and drive right through the tunnels, and into the city, or behind it. Infiltrate multiple places at once with overwhelming firepower." He looked back. "The merchants will want compensation, of course, but I'm sure they'll help, if I go talk to them." He nodded firmly.

K: "Alright, then, I'll clear it with Commodore Roos. You, me, AJ, Rarity, Vy, Octavia, Forest Spirit, Redheart, and Dusty." I grinned. "We'll go this evening.. if the Shark came with?"

Forest Spirit: "It did." He smiled broadly.

K: "Excellent." I pyramided my fingers, with a mischevious grin. "Time to make Beezen squeal."


TIME: 21:34 NCT
LOCATION: Tanjungpinang Harbor, Bintan

K: "Commandeur.." I stepped up to her. "..we'll be gone three days. By the time we get back, your Marines will be ready to fight, AND your own fleet should be here the day after. As I said, we want to take Jakarta first, but I'll discuss that with the staff that arrives with your rescue fleet." I shrugged a bit. "Anyway, Forest Spirit and Sargasso Sea can handle things on my end, and Admiral Neighgumo and the Emperor can handle their end. Other than training and repairing your vessels, let your troops rest, they'll need it. When the invasions start, it'll be very stressful and exhausting for everyone."

Roos: "Indeed it will." She nodded a bit. "I.. I mean.. I replaced Schout-bij-Nacht van Gilders, and now I replace Admiraal Duerpaard? I.." She sighed. "..I'm not sure I can do this."

K: "I have faith in you." I nodded. "There's not too much to worry about. Kolonel Wolfheze has the Marines. Just see to it your ships are ready for a fight when the time comes. And see if you can get Bali up and running. We could use the extra ship."

Roos: "I.. will do my best!" She nodded firmly. "Admiraal Duerpaard had faith in me. I must justify that."

Applejack: "Y'all'll be fine, sugarcube." She gave her a firm nod, and tipped her (Sidewinder's) hat to her. "Come on. It'll take us a full day t'get'ta Jakarta as it is." She tugged my sleeve to get into the HMS Shark.

K: "We'll be back, Commandeur." I nodded to her.

Roos: "Veel succes, vriend." She nodded back.

Getting on board the Shark was.. interesting as the hatches were made strictly for Ponies. Meaning, I had to almost crawl into them. Her Captain was..

Sea Swirl: "K!" She about dragged me out of the hatch and hugged me.

K: "CAPTAIN.. Sea Swirl." I smiled. "Been a while since Carousel Island, hasn't it?"

Sea Swirl: "It has. And now THIS?!" She ran her hoof along the railing on the ship's bridge. "The most advanced sub design in the fleet?! And I hear YOU personally recommended us for this?" She nodded to Deep Blue. "K, I mean.. submarines alone were a dream for us both - to be able to get close to sea creatures.. in their own environment. And now? We command one." She smiled with a blush. "I can't tell you what this means.."

K: "Oh, but..? They get better. If Bright Eyes can figure out how, the next series of Submarines will be much larger, and include sea-to-surface missiles." I shrugged. "Guided Ballistic Missiles. But, she already said, she can't get them any more accurate than hitting a huge static target like a city, so, they'll be stuck to being used as bombardment weapons."

Sea Swirl: "Ah." She nodded. "Is that what they're for, on Earth?"

K: "Yeah, but.. we put Daybreaker Devices on the warheads of those missiles." I shrugged. "Nuclear Brinksmanship." I leaned on the rail. "That reminds me." I put a hand on her shoulder. "You know I trust you. You've been a good friend for years. If it came down to it, do you think you could handle that responsibility?"

Sea Swirl: "I.. K?" She tilted her head. "You mean, commanding a submarine armed with Daybreaker Devices.. in case something horrible happens?"

K: "Yes.. and having the will and conviction to use them if it does, and the restraint and wisdom to know the difference." I nodded. "It's just a question right now, but in a year or so, it might be more than that." I slightly lowered myself to be level with her gaze. "It means that.. if.. Tirek does something horrific and kills the Princesses and me, or something.. that you're willing to use those Daybreaker Devices on him and everyone that lives around him as a last ditch effort to kill him - but knowing you'll probably kill over a million sentient beings in the process."

Sea Swirl: "And.. you trust me.." She blinked, coming to the realization of what I was asking of her.

Deep Blue: "Trust US." She nodded, putting her hoof on her wife's shoulder.

Yes, they were married, now, by the way.

K: "I trust you enough to ask." I nodded back.

Sea Swirl: "Even after th-" She blushed a bit. "-well.." And shrugged. "Let me think about it?"

K: "Take your time, but I will ask again if and when it becomes more of a question." I nodded softly.

Deep Blue: "Thank you for.. that kind of trust, K." She gave me a hug. "I know how much you hate those things, and how the very idea of us even thinking about using them, even as a last resort, hurts you."

K: "I'm.. I don't deserve such good friends." I smiled and hugged back.

After all, Equestria was being trusted with sole posession of these devices, under NEIGHTO, with the promise that they'll be destroyed after the war. Complete global nuclear disarmament. We'd already erased the ones the Herdiets had, and now, we had our own arsenal of them.

They were for one thing only - an emergency measure against Tirek, if I failed to secure the Rainbow of Light. Or, should Tirek slay us, the Submarines would be the world's last hope to destroy him.

All the destruction they could cause, though. All the death. The damage to the environment if they're not Airbursted just right. The very act of using them, causing a wound to nature - even though I'd used one already.

As with the deaths of every pony in this war, it weighed on my mind. A terrible weight, of a terrible fate. I could not allow this world to repeat Earth's mistakes, no matter what.

Have I mentioned how much I hate nuclear weapons?

I needed to find that Rainbow.

But, first?

Jakarta.

I slid into the small Ward Room of the Shark.. this ship was not designed to act as a flagship by any means. The follow-on Eclipse-class, and its Attack Submarine sibling, the Adirondak-class, would have much larger facilities.

Heck, my and AJ's bunk space was shared with Dusty.. and Rarity. Interesting evening had by all. And I was aching in all the best ways. Sea Swirl and Deep Blue sat across from me, as I tried to shrink myself in as best I could. A Petty Officer served us lunch.

The Shark-class were not intended for long term operations, and carried only cold foods that could be reheated, or fruits that could be left at room temperatures for a couple weeks without spoiling.

As such, lunch was simple - sandwiches and instant oats with some fruit in them. It was still "Equestrian" food, and it was a delightful return. While the Dutch did eat oats, they mainly ate rice instead in the East Indies. And the Neighponese ate rice. Lots of rice.

I reflected on how much I missed oats and "standard" fruits.

AJ: "So.. tell me, honeybun.." She shrugged a bit. "Teeka.."

K: "It's a notch below rape. I absolutely will not. Her culture is steeped in these ideas that women who become Aides to powerful Goblin males, must use sexual trickery to gain station and wealth, but their power comes from their Patron. Yeah, no." I shrugged a bit.

Deep Blue: "At least the whole 'Human lands in the Hay with every willing Mare' thing seems to have gone away." She smiled a bit.

AJ: "It's 'cuz he got married." She said, confidently. "Granny even said so." She grinned. "Speakin' of! Y'all need t'come down to th'farm some night we's all back home."

Sea Swirl: "No kidding. We've hardly been back to Ponyville since the start of the war." She sighed a bit. "And now.." She tilted her head a bit.

Deep Blue: "..we're discussing how we're going to do the family thing." She nodded to me. "We want to adopt. Question is, which of us goes home to raise the foals?"

K: "Don't even ask me." I shook my head slowly. "I am not going to insist you stay in service. If you want a family and have the chance, take it."

AJ: "Heh. I knew y'all'd say that, honeybun." She nuzzled me. "Ah miss't yew so much." She said breathlessly.

Dusk Seeker: "Can I squeeze in?" He slid in with his own lunch tray.

K: "No problem, Seeker." I nodded. "When we get to Jakarta.. how do we get in contact with the Merchants?"

Dusk Seeker: "It'll be easy enough. We go in at night, they'll be near the tunnels - some of them sleep there, especially when they have particularly valuable caches of cloths, like silks. Or, one of their employees will. We simply have to find one to talk to." He nodded sharply. "The gold we brought will do most of the talking."

K: "I'm sure it will." I shrugged a tiny bit. "Can I ask.." I leaned into him a bit. "..about your p-"

Dusk Seeker: "No. Sir."

AJ: "Aww." She said softly. "Don' worry, took me a bit t'come'ta grips with my family issues, too." She offered a small smile.

Dusk Seeker: "I prefer to keep conversation relevant to the mission at hand, ma'am." He didn't exactly grow cold, but I instantly felt as though he was a hundred miles away, even though not two feet of air was between us.

K: "Understood, Altern." I nodded. "Sea, Deep, we'll leave by rubber raft at 2100. Stay at periscope depth and keep an eye out. I don't know how long we'll be."

Sea Swirl: "No problem, K. We'll have a platoon of Bluejackets ready with small arms, just in case." She nodded.

K: "Expecting me to find trouble?" I grinned, sheepishly.

Sea Swirl, Deep Blue, Applejack: "YES!"

Outvoted.


TIME: 20:58 NCT
LOCATION: HMS Shark, 2nmi from Jakarta


My team was ready. We all had suppressed weapons. Redheart was stubbornly sticking to a sub-gun - a Silent Ridgway - while Forest Spirit, myself, and Octavia each had a Gale with an optic mounted. Vinyl Scratch, Rarity, and Dusk Seeker all had Sherman-Spencers with suppressors mounted. Dusty had a Gale/Gavin.

We were all good shots as it was.

As we got into the rubber raft and started rowing for shore, I was scanning the city itself with my binoculars. There was plenty of light coming from it, despite obvious signs of damage and destruction. A smaller Neigtherlands merchant vessel was sunk in the harbor, and was blocking the way in.

Once we got to shore, we pulled the raft up with us, and hid it in the bushes.

Dusk Seeker: "This way." He had paused a moment, as though to remind us to be quiet, then realized we were the very professionals he long sought to work with, and shrugged a bit, before moving.

Redheart had taken the step of blacking out the neck and arms of her pearly white coat with some Coalblack. Easy enough to wash out, too. Rarity was wearing long gloves, and a balaclava. The combat uniforms covered the rest.

Slipping through the jungle to the edge of town, we came upon a cut in the terrain, that led down and to the side of the city, deeper inland. And soon, we found ourselves at the mouth of a tunnel who's walls were made of fine cut stone.

I ran my fingers over it, and it felt very precisely done. Work of an ancient civilization for sure.

Dusk Seeker: "Over here." He said quietly.

Deeper into the tunnels we went. We had flashlights, and they had red filters over them, to allow us to see without giving away our position. It was interesting that our tech level was somewhere between World War I and Vietnam all at once, with absolutely modern load bearing equipment. Such is what you get when you can take a Laptop back, and start with a cell phone full of data.

Finding the Merchant storage areas wasn't hard at all. One very burly Stallion - bigger than Mac, actually - stepped right up to us.

Stallion: "Who'se'reyou?" Very Manehattan/Queens accent.

Dusk Seeker: "Pastrami?" He stepped forwards. "It's me, Dusk."

Pastrami: "DUSK SEEKER!?" He harshly whisper-shouted. "Holy Hell, my colt, it's been 20 years!" He paced up, and gave him a big back-slapping hug. "What's all this, then? You come to rescue your dad?"

Dusk Seeker: "..what!?" He recoiled. "What are you talking about?!"

Pastrami: "Yeh.. I thought that's why you'd come. Yer pops was in country getting a shipment of woven silk from Atlas and Loom.." He looked at us. "..and the Monkey Boys caught him." He nodded to me. "You General K?"

K: "I am." I nodded a bit. "We're here on a mission." I nodded to Dusk.

Dusk Seeker: "..i-uh.." He cleared his throat. "I had no idea my father was here." He shrugged. "We're here to get some assistnace from the Merchant's Guild. We want to invade Jakarta. The Equestrian Marines can launch an invasion through the tunnels.." He looked down. "..where is he?"

Pastrami: "They got him and some other Vee-Eye-Pee hostages locked up in Loom's old storehouse. They turned it into a jail." He put a hoof on Seeker's shoulder. "Listen, colt.." He looked down. "..I know things ain't goot betweens youse two.. but.. he ain't doin' so good. None of 'em are." He fixed us with a gaze.

Dusk Seeker: "If we attempt to rescue them, we could endanger the invasion." He said.. but I could tell, somewhere, his heart wasn't quite in it.

K: "Where are they? How many guards?" I stepped in. "He's still your dad, Seeker." I said, looking down and towards him. "It's also my call." And back to Pastrami.

Pastrami: "One'a these here tunnels'll get'cha real close like." He nodded to me. "About twenty guards, but the big thing is, there's a Goblin camp right next to it."

K: "We can take 'em." I smiled to Forest Spirit.

Dusty: "Mm.. I think so.." She grinned as well, and stepped up. "Hello, Pastrami. Been a long time." She playfully tapped his shoulder. "I see you took my advice and got out of the country."

Pastrami: "Well, if it isn't Sergeant Busybody." He smirked. "Funny us ending up allies like this." He shrugged, though. "But, if I hear right, your boss-"

Dusty: "Sidepiece." She smirked.

Pastrami: "-right. He knows the score. He knows how.. certain business.. is done." He grinned at me.

K: "I do." I shrugged, a little sheepishly. "I brought some presents for the Merchant's Guild. That is, a hefty bribe." I nodded to him, but dropped the smile. "See to it everyone gets a share, Pastrami. I have a feeling you have a record. I'll wipe it cleaner than Celestia's ass, if you help us, and stay out of trouble after the war."

Pastrami: "Well.. you know what, I'll take that." He nodded. "You're a stallion of your word, and I pretty much gone straight. Me and my crew." He nodded to Dusk. "We used to be hired muscle for Merchants back in the day - used to have pirates around here, yanno? And some of the nice bosses back home, liked the goods that came from here. So's, we got.. out sourced." He smiled. "That's how I knew Dusk. We busted a few heads, together, back in the day, protectin' his Dad's shipments." And he grinned widely, but let it fade. "I'll be yer talent manager. Leave the goods with me. Dusk? Loom's old tunnels, but take the black one. Don't take the red one - they got the exit covered."

Dusk Seeker: "I understand." He nodded firmly. "Thank you, Pastrami."

K: "Thank you, indeed." I grinned. "Nice to have a friend like you."

Pastrami: "Yeh." He nodded back to me. "Good to have a buddy like Dusk, though. You'll see."

K: "I'm sure I will." I nodded to the side. "Let's go. Dusk, point."

So, trouble indeed. For once, though, I wasn't the focus of it. However, that still meant I'd have to fix it.

No matter. We were professionals.

LOCATION: Underneath Jakarta, Dutch East Indies


Dusk took us along the main tunnels, and over to some tunnels that branched off to one side. I could see, now, that the networks were marked by the Merchant's cutie mark, and then subdivided by color or symbol or something. Fascinating.

Dusk Seeker: "This tunnel, here." He nodded, and led the way.

K: "Now I need to know." I stated, plainly.

Dusk Seeker: "..we don't get along." He shrugged. "Typical story, I suppose. He wanted me to be in the family business. I was.. am.. not meant for textiles." He cleared his throat a bit.

K: "Not comfortable with spilling the family secrets, hm?" I shrugged. "We all, here, have."

Rarity: "Indeed, darling." She slid up next to him. "I know a thing or two about parental disappointment." She allowed herself a small smirk that only he could see.

Dusk Seeker: "I haven't spoken to him in a very long time. After I joined the Guard, really. I came back a few times to.. help with some things.." He sighed, frustrated. "He just doesn't understand. Guarding was not a phase, it was what I was born to do." He stopped and slid down his pants to show off two crossed broadswords on his butt. "He never really accepted this."

K: "I see." I nodded a little. "But, you tried..?"

Dusk Seeker: "I did. It never worked." He frowned, the scar somehow making it look like a scowl. "And when I got this, he.." He touched the scar a bit. "..he said this should've taught me a lesson."

Forest Spirit: "I getcha." He paced up and put a hoof on his shoulder. "My dad and uncle understood why I became a Forest Ranger, though. And why I became a Marine. Still.. it's a strange calling for us." He looked back at me. "K understands."

K: "I do. You're not meant for warfare.. BUT.." I leaned over and put a hand on his shoulder. "..every Herd needs its protectors. My daughter, Starlight Mint, was born for that, too. And some day, VERY soon, I'll have to give her my blessing to wear this uniform. I won't like it, and I will be afriad evry day for her.." I shook my head. "..but.."

Applejack: "We understand." She put in. "Starlights folks gave her to us t'protect. An' now? We know she's gonna be in danger. An' lots of it." She tilted her head to the side. "An' we ain't happy. But.. this here's a real serious war. We need ever'pony we can git."

Dusty: "Shh! Can the chatter, I can hear people and it ain't ponies!" She shushed us.

We all went quiet.. we were underneath a drainage grate. I could see Gizmonks above us. One of them flicked a lit cigarette into the drain, and walked off. The other remained where he was. There was a small half-tube that skirted the wall vertically, and came up right behind him.

Dusty slithered up the half-pipe. Rarity and Dusk both got into position, just in case she didn't get it. But, she did. Both hooves slipped around the Gizmonk's ankles, and PULLED. He fell down, facing the grate. Dusk levitated his bayonet and shanked him in the neck with it.

No mercy, no hesitation. I gave him a nod.

Dusty yanked the guard into the half-pipe and down it, letting him lay flat. He was armed with a Sherman and a scope that resembled the Buff & Lamb Swallowtail. Interesting.

Dusk Seeker: "Not much further to the end." He nodded. "Stash him in that cistern. They won't find him."

Octavia: "On it." She said, as her and Vy dragged him off.

We advanced, and they caught up with us.

K: "Minimal shooting. We get in, rescue, and get out. We'll need to pull off the invasion ASAP." I nodded.

Dusk Seeker: "Understood." He twitched his scarred mouth, not sure we should be doing this, but trusting ME enough to go through with it anyway.

At the end of the tunnel, there was a ramp, wide and twisting like a corkscrew, that led up to surface level. I could see a lot of bolts of cloth and other goods stacked around. Indeed, the Merchants used these tunnels for storage, and it made sense why. Lots of room, lots of ROOMS, so they could organize things well.

We advanced up the ramp, and when we got to the top, we were in a small courtyard by the Warehouse. The walls were tall, and we could see several guards wandering around. They, however, had no light. Nothing to help them other than star light and a decent bit of moon light.

That made it easy for us to dash the 40 meters from the exit to the Warehouse doors. Once there, Dusk slid his hoof under a piece of stone in the wall, and produced a key. He went about unlocking the Warehouse, and we all slipped in..

..once inside, though, we inadvertently interrupted six Gizmonks playing cards.

Gizmonk: "WHAT THE SHIT!?" He stood immediately, but..

*PCHOONF!*

*PCHOONF!**PCHOONF!**PCHOONF!**PCHOONF!*

*CHUFF-CHUFF-CHUFF!*

*PCHOONF!**PCHOONF!*

We put them all down before they could even reach for their weapons. Dusk Seeker paced over to the first one - his shot - and leaned down.. the Gizmonk was only wounded. A precise hit.

Dusk Seeker: "Where is the VIP from Equestria?" He said, levitating the Gizmonk, but using his magic in such a way, it looked like a hand tightly gripping his collar.

Gizmonk: "Th-There's.. twoo.. ugh.. third.. cell.."

Dusk Seeker: "Key." He demanded.

Gizmonk: "Wall. Over there.. urgh.."

Dusk Seeker: "Thank you." He stood, and magically.. BROKE THE FUCKER'S NECK with a quick telekinetic twist.

Holy shit.

Vy: "Heh! Holy crap, K! He's almost as good as you." She ribbed me.

K: "He is." I smirked as Dusk Seeker grabbed the key, and we all bolted for the cells.

Redheart: "Moving up." She got up next to Dusk Seeker. "In case he needs a medic." She smirked.

Dusk Seeker: "Mmm.." He wasn't pleased, but he did his duty, and went for the cell door. He unlocked it with the Key in Telekinesis, and opened the door. "Royal Guards! We're here to get you out!"

Filthy Rich: "Ohh!" He looked at Redheart. "R-Red.. heart?"

I stepped in behind them as the others took up defensive positions.

K: "Filthy." I nodded to him. "How're ya doing?"

Filthy Rich: "N-not.. well.. K.. they've.. they've broken my legs." He coughed.. and I could see he was quite well starved and dehydrated.

His companion wasn't much better. A butternut squash colored older stallion with grey hair, he rolled over to look at us.

Brindle: "Dusk?" He simply asked.

Dusk Seeker: "Hello.. Dad." He frowned. "They're both in bad shape, General. We need litters."

K: "Redheart, do what you can for them. Vy, 'Tavi, rig up two litters. Rarity, help them. Dusty, Spirit, AJ, cover the front." I directed.

Redheart: "I'll see what I can do, but they do need a hospital." She shrugged, moving from Filthy to Brindle. "Sir."

Brindle: "Just a few busted ribs, young lady." He coughed hard.. and there was a bit of dried blood on his lips. "Dusk.. I.. I didn't think.." He looked away.

Dusk Seeker: "...I had no idea you'd been captured.." He looked down. "Dad.. I.." He shook his head. "I'm doing my job. As a Lunar Guard, it's my duty to protect you.. rescue you."

Brindle: "Mmm." He didn't quite acknowledge that.

K: "Redheart?" I nodded to her as Vy and 'Tavi brought the two litters.

Redheart: "They're stable. Let's go." She stood, and grabbed Brindle's litter at the front.

K: C> "Alpha to Shark. We ran into some trouble and are bringing out some POW's. Get ready.. this is going to be tight."

Deep Blue: C> "Shark acknowledges. We'll be ready to receive guests."

K: "Let's move." I nodded.

Well.. rather unexpectedly, Dusk is being forced to face his past, in the field of battle he knew would be his future. And we? Had stuck our necks WAAAY further in than we should have! But.. we just needed to get back to the sub, right?

Right?
