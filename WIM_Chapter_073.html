Part 1: Lasso Report

TIME: 06:33 ERDT
DATE: War Day 694/28 Secundus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Canterlot, Kingdom of Equestria

The early train to Canterlot arrives at six. Meaning, I have to be at the Ponyville Train Station by five fifteen. The train departed at 5:20 and was an Express to Canterlot.

From there, it takes about.. ohh.. ten minutes to get to the Palace.

From THERE.. it takes but a couple minutes to get to Luna's room...

Luna: "HARDER!"

...which gives me plenty of time to have some fun before most morning conferences at 7:30.

K: "GOD, you're SOAKED..!" *Grunts*

Luna: "YES! Mmmmm!! Auhhhhhhhhhhh...! YES!"

Not that I did this regularly, I just had a.. kinky idea while I was on the train, since Luna likes to shower before morning conferences, then go straight to bed.

K: "Okayy.. uhhmm.. mmm..." I flopped over her. "Let's.. let's get your mane.."

I shakily got the shampoo off the shelf, and squirted some right on her mane. And massaged it.

Luna: "Mmmmm... My General.." She trilled that out.

K: "Gets you excited to call me that, huh?" I dripped into her ear as I massaged her neck with the shampoo.

Luna: "Mmmmmmm.. yes.. that and your usual uniform is as black as night.." She rubbed her head against me a bit.

K: "I do love you, you know." I hugged her, and got kinda down on my knees, so I could soap her up a bit more.

Luna: "And I love you." She turned and kissed me.. passionately.

Mmm.. chocolatey! A rich, deep, flavorful chocolate with a hint of marshmallow. I think I did mention she tastes like Moon Pies. Never mind that those are her favorite snack, too.

I moved around her, to her front, and let her drape her forelegs over me, so I could get all the angles on her mane better.

K: "I'm so glad we make this work." I looked her right in the eyes. "If I'm immortal, I know that I'll have someone that loves me, for all time. And that's a treasure.."

There was a knock on the bathroom door, however.

K: "The General-Field Marshal and the Princess of the Moon are busy! This BETTER be important!" I called towards it.

Comr. Jack Galloway: "It's Jack Galloway, General! I wouldn't interrupt if this wasn't important! There's been an explosion at the Appleloosa Arsenal!"

K: "Pfff-" My cuss was interrupted with a kiss.

Luna: "We shall be out, post-haste, Commissioner!" She called to the door.

K: "Damnit, I'm still horny..!" I murmured into her ear.

Luna: "Oh, fear not, My General.. we shall tend to that..." She gave me a smirk.


TIME: 06:55 ERDT


I was still drying my hair, and only had my black uniform shirt loosely around me, by the time I came into the Conference Room with Luna.

K: "Gentlecolts.. this better be good!" I snorted.

Comr. Galloway: "It is, sir." He nodded. "There was an explosion at Appleloosa Arsenal about two hours ago. Sheriff Silver Star is certain it was sabotage." He shrugged.

K: "Well. Okay, that's a reason to interrupt me." I sat down, as a Guardspony brought me coffee.

Luna: "Indeed!" She nodded to Celestia, who was just coming in. "Sister."

Celestia: "Mm.." *YAAAWWWWNN* "..make it strong." She nodded to the Guard, who added a scoop of freeze-dried coffee to her cup. "K." She nodded to me.

K: "Possible sabotage at Appleloosa Arsenal, Cel." I frowned a bit. "It's.." I shook my head. "..that's one of our main arsenals. That, Springfield, and Milan Army Ammunition Plant are our three largest facilities."

Celestia: "Mm." She nodded, and let me take the lead while she slurped bean juice...

..not that her sister hadn't been slurping something else but a few minutes ago..!

K: "What assets do we have in the area?" I started in. "Appleloosa has a Militia Company, right?"

Comr. Galloway: "Yes, sir." He nodded. "And besides Silver Star, a Squad of Gendarmes, there's the Buffalo Tribe Special Security Force. That's another 48 on top of the 60 from town, and 6 Gendarmes. Town's population was just over 2200 at the last census - it's grown a lot since the start of the war, though, so it's probably close to four thousand, by now."

K: "Nearest Army base?" I nodded.

LTGEN Silver Spark: "Fort at North Pass." He nodded. "It was constituted about a month ago, and hasn't been properly named, yet. The nearby city is North Pass, Texas."

ACM Aero Dart: "The Air Force established a local training facility north of there. Alamogordo Air Force Base. It was established about a week before the Army base." He shrugged. "They received their first flight of F/A-1 Falcons.. probably yesterday."

K: "So, the area is undermanned." I nodded. "No problem, I'll take a select team and go in myself." I shrugged. "It's close to the Mulexico border, right?"

LTGEN Silver Spark: "Sure is." He nodded.

Forest Spirit: "My family has a ranch in the region - near Port Arthur. It's on the other side of the state, but.." He shrugged. "..if you're heading in by train, the fastest route would be through the lines along the coast. Inland, you get the Hog and Sheep ranchers pushing livestock on cargo cars."

K: "Huh." I nodded. "Alright, Spirit." I looked at Celestia. "There was something that -I- wanted to bring up - we still haven't had a good chance to go through all the information available in the Crystal Kingdom. I wanted to send the girls, there." I looked at Forest Spirit. "With chaperone."

Forest Spirit: "Works for me. We should be back in plenty of time to get to Paris for the 2nd Anniversary celebrations." He nodded. "And Redheart is cleared for duty. So's Dusty."

K: "Good. You take Redheart with you - keep the girls out of trouble and get her out of the house. Heck, take the kiddos, this should - SHOULD - be an easy assignment." I shrugged.

Forest Spirit: "Sounds like fun!" He beamed a grin. "I'll get a chance to really have a family vacation."

K: "Everyone should make time for that sort of thing." I nodded to the other Department Heads. "That means making sure active duty troops get enough Leave Time."

LTGEN Silver Spark: "Oh, agreed." He nodded.

Colonel Golden Harvest-Script: "It's not a problem for us, really." She shrugged. "Militia are based in their communities. They only really have to worry about training days."

K: "Which reminds me, make sure all the major formations in the North-East Department complete the revised six-week training regimen. I know a few more outlying forces, haven't. The Militia units in Maine were a mixed bag - that, thankfully, didn't devolve into a major combat action." I wagged a finger at her.

Celestia: "Mmm.. yes.. thanks to your diplomacy, K." She finished her coffee and started in on a honey bun.

Luna: "That's because our General is aware of Hero Mistakes, and even incorporated it into our training." She was eating a Moon Pie.

Admiral Whitecap: "Well, I'm glad for it. I wish Saletine had.." She sighed. "..listened better."

K: "He was too damn stubborn to do anything but jump right for the enemy's throat!" I chuckled with a tear. "But, let that be a lesson to all of us - sacrifice is sometimes necessary, but don't wedge yourself into a position where it's your only choice. Better training, discipline, and experience will help prevent that."

ACM Aero Dart: "Indeed!" He nodded. "And these new Aero Planes.. new equipment in general.. will help as well." He sniff-twitched his mustache. "If I had any reservations about you, K, they disintegrated long go. Now, I'm grateful we have a leader that knows what he's doing - nothing worse than going into a fight with someone that doesn't care."

K: "Thank you, Dart!" I smiled a bit. "Alright, everyone.. if there's nothing else?"

They all looked around the table, no comments.

K: "Then, today's meeting is adjourned. You all know what to do." I stood, and they departed.

I looked over at Celestia.

Celestia: "..Mommy wants breakfast." She stated, flatly, and got up to go to the kitchen.

K: "I'll cook.." I smirked.. and winked at Luna.. who followed me, following her.

We went to the kitchen and I dismissed the staff, going right to the chill box and getting out all the fixin's for a.. more human breakfast.

Celestia: "It IS nice to spend time like this." She h'mm'd a bit.

Luna: "I feel we will have much time like this, should he prove to be as immortal as we, dear sister." She was being extra affectionate today.

Honestly, I was still a bit horny. But, I quashed that by mixing up pancake batter, and carefully starting the flat griddle to make hotcakes.

Starlight Mint was in Ponyville, with her other Mom. Just us three Adults.

I fried some pork sausage, fresh eggs, and hotcakes. The hotcakes got a generous dose of fruits to them in the batter - Peaches for Celestia, Blueberries for Luna, and Strawberries for me.

They made me think of my human wife, J--.

Served, we sat at the Chef's Table, and got comfortable.

K: "Thank you for the food, Sun Goddess." I gave her a hug as I sat down.

Celestia: "Ohh.. so thoughtful." She grinned widely.

K: "I'm serious about taking a team to Texas to sort this matter out." I nodded.

Luna: "We figured." She grinned.

K: "Since I'm sending the Girls up north, I think I'll pick a team that hasn't seen as much action, lately. Get them some field experience. Cousin Braeburn is at the Farm, actually, he took some Leave time to visit AJ and Mac." I shrugged.

Luna: "We know you'll pick the best ponies for the job." She started eating, after drowning her hotcakes in syrup and butter.

Celestia: "And you'll probably get a lot of other business out of the way, as well." She shrugged, dusting hers with powdered sugar.

K: "Eh.. if there's trouble, I'll fix it." I nodded, adding a bit of both to mine.

Truth is, I didn't know how MUCH trouble there'd be!

Part 2: Preparation

TIME: 11:33 ERDT
DATE: War Day 695/29 Secundus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Ponyville Militia HQ/2nd Command Station of the Equestrian Armed Forces, Ponyville

I was assembling a new team. The Girls would be leaving soon to go to the Crystal Kingdom on a bit of a book tour. Every town would be checked, if possible, for books relating to the past or the Rainbow of Light.

Wide Lens was still in the hospital. The blade that had cut him, damaged his right kidney, and while he wasn't in any immediate danger, he was sidelined for now, possibly for months. It all depended on how well he healed.

K: "Cody!" I grinned.

Dr. Allcome: "Ah, K. You.. wanted to see me?" He tilted his head, with a smile.

K: "Yeah, I want you on my team - there's been sabotage at Appleloosa Arsenal. I might need you, to check the wounded. Not that the town's own medical personnel wouldn't be just fine, I might need you to ID the wounds as being explosion related or something else." I shrugged.

Dr. Allcome: "Ah, a bit of Forensic Medicine!" He grinned. "Sounds lovely."

K: "That and.." *Throat clearing* "..we all know I end up in a lot of trouble."

Dr. Allcome: "You do, K." He frowned a bit. "And you know that I'll be there to heal you any time you need it."

K: "Which I appreciate." I nodded.

Dr. Allcome: "So, who's all coming?" He shrugged. "And, when do we depart?"

K: "Chem, Dex, Vy, Octavia, Gaze, Cosmic, Norfy, Derpy, Teddy, Spitfire, Soarin, Brae, Mac, and Vig. And Sweetheart, if you want her." I nodded.

Dr. Allcome: "Certianly." He grinned. "I'll go let her know." A nod and shrug. "I suppose I'm shaping up to be a lot more important to this war than I thought I'd be."

K: "Cody, without you, I'd be dead. We all would be. Gloom Mountain. And on top of that, you keep me going - you're a friend. A good friend." I nodded to him.

Dr. Allcome: "I'll let Sweetheart know. I think she'll be happy to have a Combat Date with her.. new coltfriend." He smirked.

K: "Teddy!" I grinned.

Dr. Allcome: "Certainly. I think.. whatever was still there from her past incarnation.. is drawn to him." He shrugged. "Norfy would know better, though."

K: "I'm sure he'd agree." I nodded, with a smile.

Dr. Allcome: "Alright, I'll go get prepared." He departed.

Applejack came in, at that point. Alone. And slid up into my lap, Cowgirl style. Mind you, we're both clothed (and if you recall, that's a FLIRT). She hugged on me, and we just sat like that for a bit.

K: "It's good to be home." I kissed her on the lips.

Applejack: "Mm.. an' we'll be leavin' again soon." She frowned. "Y'all takin' Dusty?"

K: "Yup. Besides you, this is her territory." I nodded.

Applejack: "Ah'd rather be th' one goin'." She frowned.

K: "I know. I rather you would, too. But.. if you find some kind of an ancient puzzle that requires ALL the elements..?" I tilted my head.

Applejack: "Oh, ah git'cha! I git'cha! I dun gotta be happy 'bout it, but I git'cha!" She kissed me again. "Ah'm all packed. An'.. the train.. don't leave.. fer a couple hours.." She LOCKED lips with me at that point, and kicked off the ground, sending my chair backwards, to the ground, and pinning me in place.

Damn, I love her.

TIME: 11:03 ERDT
DATE: 698/2 Terious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Port Arthur, Texas

We were all disembarking at the train station. Forest Spirit's father, Heath Spirit, was there to meet us..

Heath Spirit: "Ah! You must be General K." The slightly overweight, but tall, stallion in a red vest, white shirt, and dark pants with horse cowboy boots on his rear hooves, stepped forwards.

Like Forest Spirit, he had a red mane, and unlike his son, sported a mustache and goatee combo that made him look very stately.

I shook hand/hooves with him.

K: "Yes, let me introduce some of my officers. Majors Dex Runner, Norfy Loconsole, Cosmic Plane, Lidless Gaze, and Derpy Whooves. Captains Chemical Lens, Theodore, Dr. Cody Allcome, and Spitfire. That's Lieutenant Soarin Skies and Lieutenant Braeburn Smith, my cousin. This here's my brother-in-law, Quartermaster Sergeant Big Macintosh Apple, then Sergeants Dusty Dunes, Vigilance, Octavia Melody, Vinyl Scratch-Runner - Dex's Wife - and Nurse Sweetheart."

While Chemical Lens was indeed present, I could tell her mind was elsewhere.

Heath Spirit: "Quite the collection." He grinned and nodded. "A pleasure to meet you all." He gestured to the rather fit stallion next to him. "This is my other son, Plains Spirit."

K: "Ah.. I didn't know Forest had a brother." I shrugged. "We didn't really get a chance to meet at the wedding - right after all the ceremony happened, I had to run to Quirtbeck."

Plains Spirit: "Yeah, it happens. I'm actually his twin." He shrugged. "My father and I are also in charge of the Port Arthur Militia. He's a Major, I'm Captain and commander of the Ranger company."

K: "Ah, nice." I nodded. "Forest said you'd put us up." I nodded.

Heath: "Oh, for sure." He nodded. "Come on, we'll head to the Estate."

The city of Port Arthur was a shipping terminal for the area. It was bustling, and I could see several O-1 and P-1 class patrol vessels out on the water.

K: "I see you've got about eight patrol vessels out there." I nodded.

Heath Spirit: "Have to. Mulexico doesn't like us very much, and they've been aggressive at times. Before the Steel Fleet, we used to have Privateers out there, keeping security. A lot of it, my family!" He chuckled.

Plains Spirit: "We're.. ah.. a pretty large family, General. Not quite as big as the Apples, but in this area, we make up about 5% of the population through first cousin relation. 12% if you go to third cousins." He smirked.

Spitfire: "Ohh.. impressive." She nodded. "Where's the nearest air base?"

Heath Spirit: "Pelican Split Naval Air Station, 105 kilometers south-west, by the city of Gravelston." He nodded. "They just got their first six F/A-1's two days ago."

Soarin': "Sounds.. sounds great." He seemed a bit distracted.

K: "Uh, anyways.." I shrugged.

Heath Spirit: "Come, come. We've prepared a Texas Feast for you." He grinned widely. "We intend to have a Fiesta!"

When he said Texas Feast? He wasn't kidding. Smoked pork, smoked lamb, what I could identify as Tex-Mex dishes in Vegetarian form, Cider, Beer, the works. The fiesta at Heath Spirit's Ranch was.. grand. I felt more like I was having dinner at an Uncle's house, he made us all feel so welcome. We met several others of his family.. really.. it was an amazing time.

I was grateful I could have such respite after three days on a train, with stops for fuel and water. Seeing all the happy foals running around, reminded me well of what we were all fighting for.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Hot Flight

TIME: 07:22 ERDT
DATE: War Day 700/4 Tertious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Nearing Appleloosa, Texas

Sabotage at the Appleloosa Arsenal.

Havoc was on leave, with his Rangers in Canida getting some time to their families. Sacquet was also on leave, now having proven himself in battle, he returned to Paris the conquering hero - Escargot had sworn me to secrecy that he was to be promoted again, at the 2nd Anniversary celebrations in a month or so.

I reflected on how far our army had come since then. Only two years, and we were operating a fairly powerful late-19th century navy, with a true angled deck supercarrier, skipping over all the aircraft carrier construction generations. We had an Air Force that was rapidly taking shape, with the C-1 Buffalo long range transport aircraft having taken its maiden flight yesterday, and production started immediately. It's close cousin, the B-1 LeMay bomber, was due to start production very soon. Our land army had the M-1 Tassigny Medium Tank, with the M-2 Powell entering service by The Day of Infamy, and the M-3 Buford Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (or M-4 Meade light tank, depending on the turret) due to start production not long after that.

I had already designed and approved plans to mount 90mm medium artillery guns on M-2 Powell chassis, as self-propelled artillery. The 155mm guns we had were just too large for any of our tank chassis to mount without reliability issues. These were the same 90mm guns used on Crystal Kingdom airships, but with slightly shorter barrels.

Dusty was asleep against me. We were in my private cabin. She was fully healthy, but despite that, we'd only cuddled the previous night, while she told me what had happened to her in Maine. Apparently, we arrived only about twenty or thirty minutes after she'd been stabbed. She'd also seen the ghosts of the residents, but, she was familiar with hauntings, and avoided them. Her and Wide Lens had been with a few members of the Legion, but split up during a firefight, and couldn't find each other again.

She said she felt responsible for Wide being wounded.

K: "Hey.." I nudged her. "..we're going to be there, soon."

Dusty: "Mmm.." She raised her head up.. and sheepishly kissed my cheek. "Thank you for that. I really needed to feel.. cared about."

K: "Just because we sleep together, doesn't mean we need to fuck." I shrugged.

Braeburn: "Knock-knock! Y'all decent, Cousin?" He wheeled in a breakfast cart.

K: "Come on in, Brae." I smirked.

He saw me, shirtless, in bed with a nude Dusty.. and blushed.

K: "Oh, come off it. We just cuddled. She needed love." I shrugged.

Braeburn: "Ah.. sorry, cuzin." He lowered his head a moment. "I'uh.. dun know how many Mares y'all gots in yer stable.. so.."

K: "A limited number, enforced by Princess and Wife." I hugged Dusty a bit. "She was the last addition."

Dusty: "Is that.. Eggs Benedict?" She slipped out of the bed, and went to sniff the nommy-noms.

Braeburn: "Yeah! Had'a heckuva time tryin'a make'em on a train, but we done did it." He smirked. "Flapjacks, fresh jam, toast, apples, cherries, hash browns.." He lifted the lid.

Indeed, a veritable feast.

K: "Everyone else's getting breakfast, too, right?" I cocked a brow at him. "You didn't just make this for me?"

Braeburn: "Naw! Soarin helped.. ever-one's gettin' some good country eats." He beamed a grin.

Soarin came in after him.. and placed a large pie on the rolling cart.

Soarin: "Uh.. forgot the pie." He nodded to Braeburn.

Dusty looked between them, then back to me.

Dusty: "I'm going to go get a shower." She slithered off to my miniature bathroom, which did include a shower stall.

Soarin: "General.. uhm." He seemed.. off-put - very unusual for him, but he'd been off for DAYS at this point.

K: "Just K, Soarin, please." I shrugged, and sat fully up, got up, and went for my pants - I was only in my underware.

Soarin: "What's-the-thing-in-the-human-world-of-two-stallions-being-t'gether?!" He stammered out fast, and with great difficulty.

K: "Oh, uh.." I shrugged. "..didn't know you felt like that about me, Soarin." I gave a small grin. "I'm flattered. We don't really care as much as we used to - it used to be highly taboo, even illegal." I gestured. "I'm bisexual, but I haven't met any males here that interest me that way, yet." No one knew about Prelkov but Sinichka, Rarity, and Fluttershy - and he wasn't interest, that was punitive war rape and murder.

Yes, I am Bisexual - argue all you want about it, but I've never met a real human man that I've ever wanted to be with in any serious capacity, though several that I thought were kissably cute and a few I'd drill into the mattress. Interestingly enough, J-- always wanted to see me plow a guy.. eh!

Technicolor stallions do not Expand The Dong, so, you're not going to see any of that, here.

Braebrun: "Ahhhhhhh.... not.. YOU... cousin..." He suddenly turned DEEP red.

K: "...oh." I blinked.

Well, there's another fandom/clopfic thing that came true: SoarBurn!

Soarin: "Not saying you aren't.. uhm.." He was very uncomfortable.

K: "Skip it. I'll assume you're going to compliment me anyway, might be harboring a few fantasies, and leave it there. So, you two, huh?" I tilted my head. "Why are you bringing me into this?"

Braeburn: "Cuz I wan'cha t'be my best man!" He beamed.

Soarin: "I.. asked Spitfire to be my Best Lady.." He looked down.

K: "Can I ask if there's a gender dynamic, here? Like, is Braeburn the masculine, and you the feminine, Soarin?" I blinked, and went for the coffee.. I still hadn't put my pants on.

Soarin: "We.. kinda.. switch?" He tilted his head.

K: "Cool." I shrugged a bit, and pat Soarin on the shoulder. "I'm happy for you. And I accept, with honor. So, you going to take each other's last names?"

Soarin: "Nah." He looked down.

K: "Again, I feel like there's something here I need to know about." I sipped the coffee, and nommed on some buttered toast. "Sit, eat with me. There's enough here for six people."

Braeburn: "Soarin's kinda 'fraid t'tell his folks, y'see.." He tilted his head, as he sat and dished up.

K: "Aha." I nodded. "And you want some advice, hoping I might have some knowledge there, since I seem to have knowledge just about everywhere." I raised my eyebrows. "Actually, I take that as a bigger compliment than wondering how I might do with a couple handsome stallions."

Soarin: "UH!" He blushed. "Y-You're.. welcome?"

Dusty came in, having heard the whole thing, and just got her Desert Camo pants on, taking a seat, and dishing up her own breakfast.

K: "If you don't think your parents would approve of two stallions being together.. don't worry about it. The Apple Family will accept you. I accept you." I patted his hoof. "You were one of the first wounded in this war, and you took some really bad hits, then went out and did brave things. That alone makes me indebted to you. I'm sorry I didn't get much chance to get to know you better over the last four years, but if Braeburn wants to marry you, then you're a cousin of mine, as far as I'm concerned."

Soarin: "Thank you.. K." He finally smiled. "But, what about my parents?"

Dusty: "Cut'em loose." She stared straight at him, chewing on her toast with butter and jam. "If they don't accept you for who you are, they don't need to be worried about. When you get married, that's when you start your own family - if your old one doesn't want to be a part of that, that's on them." She looked at me. "Saw this a lot in Las Pegasus - marriages the families didn't approve of."

Braeburn: "See?" He hugged Soarin.. and kissed him in front of us.

K: "Awwww..! You two look so in love." I beamed a grin. "I'm so happy for you."

Dusty: "Gonna adopt?" She moved to the eggs, now, relishing them.

Soarin: "We haven't decided.. we think we'll talk about that after the war." He shrugged. "Or, maybe we find a war orphan." He looked at me. "You did."

K: "Indeed I did." I smiled a bit.

Dusty: "You two'll be fine." She smirked a bit. "We should be arriving so-"

Gaze: "K!" He ran in. "Get gear-" He looked at my state of undress, and the company I was keeping. "..ah. Bettah git yer stuff on! We jus' got a radio call from the Appleloosa Militia - they're under attack!"

K: "Get your gear! Have the train stop as close to Appleloosa as possible without getting the engine shot up. Everyone, get ready!"

Soarin: "I'll get armed up, take Spitfire, and get a scouting report!" He hurriedly kissed Braeburn on the lips, and flew out.

Braeburn: "I'll git th' heavy weapons ready!" He paused a moment, gave me a small nod, and dashed out.

Gaze: "..I miss somethin', suh?" He gave me a quizzical look. "Ach, I'll deal wi'it later.." He dashed off to get ready.

Great. Another emergency.

Part 4: Wild, Wild West

TIME: 07:47 ERDT
DATE: War Day 710/22 Tertious 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: 1km from Appleloosa, Texas

I tossed Dusty the rest of her uniform, as I dug for mine. Desert tan Equestria pattern, human sized, with black denim tactical vest, and a tan watchcap with my rank insigna on it. Not that I needed it. Black webbed belt on, with Canidan Hi-Power. Over to the weapon locker, and I pulled out my C-7 Bradley/Gavin, passing Dusty her Equestrian Bradley/Gavin. We started filling our vests with magazines and grenades.

Dusty: "Whoever pulled this off made a very bad move." She started. "We've become experts at this kind of warfare." Shaking her head, she got her helmet on. "On top of that, Texans are always well armed.. even before the war, before you, I know most Texans owned large knives, slingshots, things like that." She looked up at me, and gave ME a kiss on the lips. "Before you taught us Justified Violence." And a smirk.

K: "You know, you keep this up.." I trailed off a bit, getting my radio in its satchel. "..you might end up closer to my orbit." I was meaning, of course, if something happened to AJ, she might become my next pony wife, if not Luna. "Come on." Black boots, last thing - I laced up, tightened each rivet hole, and stomped good.

I had to admit, I was very attracted to her, and having her accepted by the girls as being acceptable in my Paddock only made things better and worse. She was finally accepted by real friends, even if she wasn't an Element - she didn't care about that. I could tell, though, she was very, very attracted to me in return. Ever since Quirtbeck.

We got towards the front of the train, where everyone was finishing arming up. Braeburn and Mac had an Abrams machine gun, and the spare belts - Braeburn also had a Funston RPG. Soarin and Spitfire were already out the side and flying off to scout ahead. Teddy hefted his Timberwolf sniper rifle, and gave me a nod. Octavia was grinning.

Octavia: "And it figures, I get completely healed up - more or less - and you get me in another fight." She shrugged.

Vinyl: "Hey, at least you're with me and Dex." She patted her on the back.

Dex: "We're ready t'go, General-Dude." He nodded.

K: "Right. You're second, Dex." I gave him a small point. "All Rangers here." I shrugged.

Dr. Allcome: "Well, except me-"

Derpy: "Come off it, Doc. If you're not a Ranger by NOW.." She smirked.

Dr. Allcome: "-Ah! Well, I suppose I am, then." He smiled a bit.

Gaze and Cosmic came from the head of the train, in a hurry.

Cosmic: "We're stopping. Now." He nodded. "They're pinned down just up ahead - the enemy is attacking in force. At least two companies." He pointed to the starboard side of the train.

I got to the window, and indeed, I could see evidence of battle up ahead.. the train was slowing. I could see Spitfire and Soarin heading back.

K: "Scouts coming back - prepare to disembark." I gestured with one hand in the air.

I got to the side door of the train car we were in, and opened it. We were still going pretty fast.. Spitfire flew right to the door, and reversed position, keeping flight pace with the train as it slowed down.

Spitfire: "Two companies or better, with armored support. Mainly Duregars and Raptorians." She shrugged. "I have no idea how they got this kind of equipment into Equestria, sir."

K: "Me neither, Captain." I gave her a nod. "You two go on up ahead and drop some flares for good approach vectors - I want to catch them between us and the Militia."

Spitfire: "Aye, General." She took off again.

The train was slow enough that we could jump out. Dex went first, and landed in a perfect trot. The others followed. I was last. The drawback of having two legs, I couldn't disembark at as high of a speed as they could. I waited until the train was at a walking pace, swung out, and stepped down, and continued that pace, with some mental difficulty - there was still that human instinct that I was doing something risky.

No matter. We started marching for the bluffs around the town, at a fast pace, eyes darting this way and that, searching for the enemy - an ambush, a rear guard, whatever. We followed dropped illumination flares from Spitfire and Soarin. My eyes were creeping along the rocks.. I made sure an AP shell was loaded into my Gavin.

The sounds of shooting got closer, and I waved Cosmic over. Grabbing the radio pack's mic, I called in, hoping someone had ears on.

K: C> "This is Alpha Actual to Sierra Six-Three or Adam Six-Three - How Copy, Over?" Adam being the designation for the town militia - I had switched the Civil Guard (Gendarmes and Militia) over to the "Adam-Baker" system, maintaining the "Alpha-Bravo" system for the active duty military. Six-three being the command element.

Buffhorn: C> "This is Sierra Five, Sergeant Buffhorn. Sierra Six-Three is down. Contact with Adam Six was lost ten minutes ago. What's your twenty?"

K: C> "Sierra Five, Alpha Party is half a klick from the edge of town, in the short mesas to the south and east. SitRep, over?"

Buffhorn: C> "Sierra has taken heavy casualties. We've lost our anti-tank guns. Adam has been forced to withdraw to the town - we're holding the factory, but the enemy has us pinned down. Equally, we have denied the enemy advance with improvised mines and explosive traps. We are at a stalemate! Requesting support, over!"

K: C> "I'll handle it, Sierra Five." I switched the radio to long range, to connect with the radio network that had been growing within the country over the last two years. C> "Alpha Actual to Alamagordo Air Force Base - come in, over."

Lt. Fly Higher: C> "Alamagordo Air Force Base copies, Alpha Actual. Go ahead."

K: C> "Requesting immediate air support - Appleloosa Arsenal is under direct attack by enemy ground forces. Attack Squadrons are designated Hornet. Air superiority designated Swatter. MedEvac designated Angel. Alamagordo Air Base designated as Stable. How copy?"

Lt. Fly Higher: C> "Stable copies. Will scramble. ETA for close air support is.. fifty-five minutes."

K: C> "Roger that, Stable." I switched channels to the ground force channel. C> "This is Alpha Actual to all Militia forces within range of this broadcast. Appleloosa Arsenal is under direct attack by the enemy. Reinforcements are requested. Any Militia or Gendarmes force approaching within three klicks is to call in to Alpha Command."

Col. Whiterider: C> "Alpha Actual! This is Arrowhead Six-Three! We're just across the border! ETA is two hours! Friendlies approach from the north! Don't fret, Alpha! The New Mulexico Rangers are on the way!"

I shrugged, looking at everyone.

K: C> "Roger Arrowhead Six. Be advised, friendlies control the structures, town, and factory grounds. Enemy is holed up in the mesas to the south and east. Request you reinforce Sierra Team at the Factory. Over!"

Col. Whiterider: C> "Yew got it, Alpha! YEE-HAW! Arrowhead, out!"

K: "Give'em points for enthuseasim. Dusty? You know of the New Mulexico Militia getting any combat experience?" I tilted my head.

Dusty: "Hmm. No, not that I'd heard. I think that was Colonel Whiterider on Comms, sir. He's.. colorful." She giggled a bit. "But he's a good pony, sir."

K: "Right. Alright, let's get some defensive terrain plotted, here." I gestured. "And try to keep them pinned into the rocks." I gestured for Spitfire and Soarin.

Spitfire: "Yes, General?" She changed magazines on her Bradley.

K: "We're going to pen them into the mesas until reinforcements get here. What's their escape routes look like?" I nodded to the Mesas we were just now entering.

Spitfire: "They have three valleys that they can try to use if they don't want to go rock climbing, sir. We can block one of them easily with some explosives. The other two? The one closest to us is a defender's dream - lots of spots to hide and some clear paths between them. The last one's tough, sir - there's a few good defensive positions, but they're easy to spot and pin down." She shrugged.

K: "Okay. Dex, Vy, Octavia, Mac, Teddy, Sweetheart, Soarin, Braeburn, Derpy, you take the last pass. Derpy, Dusty, Spitfire, Vigilance, Cosmic, Gaze, Norf, Doc, with me. Spitfire, Soarin, you'll be messengers if the radios are damaged - join us after you block the second passage." I gestured. "Let's go."

An even split, more or less. The northern pass would be covered by my best sniper and a machine gun team - it being the hardest to defend, it needed extra resources. My team all had rifles, though Vigilance had a Funston RPG and three rockets. We all got into position without incident, though once we did, we could see the enemy...

Part 5: Mesa

TIME: 08:18 ERDT
DATE: War Day 710/22 Tertious 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: 1km from Appleloosa, Texas


Vigilance: "There, sir." He pointed. "Right by the rocks. Looks like the rear guard."

Dusty: "Five in the open, by an APC." She looked at me.

K: "We can leave them there, for now." I nodded. "Let Spitfire and Soarin blow the pass, and Team 2 get into position, first. Then we'll get their attention."

Octavia: C> "Alpha Two to Alpha Actual - in position and dug in. Over."

K: C> "Roger." I nodded.

I heard the explosion, and saw Soarin and Spitfire fly up, split, and head to their assigned positions.

K: C> "Alpha to Sierra and Adam - we've closed the back door. ETA on Reinforcements from Arrowhead is one hour, forty minutes. ETA on air support is thirty six minutes. How copy, over?"

Buffhorn: C> "Sierra Five copies."

Sheriff Silver Star: C> "This is Adam George Actual - we read you, Alpha! Sierra Five, Adam Two-Two and Adam George Two-One are headed your way ta reinforce ya! Apologies fer missin' yer call, Alpha - I wuz indisposed! Adam George Actual, Out!"

Cosmic: "Well, at least Sheriff Silver Star's okay.." He looked at me. "..what's he to you, K?"

K: "Now that I'm married to AJ? Uhm.. uncle-in-law." I nodded. "Movement!"

Down by the five Rear Guard Duregars, a Raptorian came out from the rocks and started rushing over to them. I sighted him in.. and peppered the area around him with ten rounds, scoring three hits on full auto on a running target at 350 meters. He went down.

Norfy: "Take'em! Vig!" He pointed at the APC.

Vigilance: "BACKBLAST - CLEAR!" He aimed the Funston.

*PWT-FWAAAHHSHOOOM!* *BOW-PLAMMM!!!*

Direct hit on the engine compartment. That vehicle was down. Shrapnel flattened an enemy soldier. Dusty picked one off with her rifle, while Norfy fired an ice shot at the rest, smashing it into the area like a tiny meteor, and partially freezing them in place, giving the others free shots. They were dead in moments.

K: "Nice one, Norf!" I patted his back.

Norfy: "Hey, gotta keep the skills up." He shrugged.

With that settled, I moved everyone around a little, to get better firing angles. I took Cosmic and moved far forward, in a little circle of rocks that was well covered from the enemy side, but down about one "level" from the rest.

K: "Good observation post." I nodded. "Load your Gavin with HE." I instructed.

Cosmic: "Yep." He nodded.

K: "You heard Soarin and Braeburn are hooking up?" I smirked. "They want to get married - Brae wants me as his best man." I chuckled.

Cosmic: "Mm.. I'm glad for them. Speaking of which.." He looked down a bit. "I proposed to Kiwi. She said yes."

K: "You want me as Best Man, too?" I looked over at him.

Cosmic: "She wants you to give her away. She hasn't got any parents - she's got a bunch of cousins on her mother's side, but she doesn't know them all that well." He shrugged a bit. "Besides, I already asked Norfy."

K: "Oh? Got Gaze as a Groomsman?" I smirked.

Cosmic: "Yeah." He beamed. "Thanks, K. Without you and this war, I probably would've been a lonely nerd forever. Now? I.. I got a wife, man! Or, I will. And.. she wants lots of kids." He was bubbling with joy.

We sat in silence a bit longer, before the radio crackled to life.

Capt. Longyard: C> "Hornet Three to Alpha! How Copy, over?!"

K: C> "Alpha Actual here, Hornet Three! What's your ETA?"

Capt. Longyard: C> "Hornet Three, Five, and Six - ETA seven minutes. Armed for CAS, no ordnance. Call me in."

K: C> "Roger. Sierra Five, Hornet Three is at your disposal." I passed the resource off to the ones that needed it. "They were probably already in the air doing a patrol when this happened." I shrugged.

Cosmic: "I betcha." He smirked. "We can be very industrious and studious when put to a task, sir."

K: "Yeah!" I chuckled.

Several minutes later, I could see.. three F/A-1 Falcons fly overhead. They weren't Pegasi, these were my new modern fighters. Ooohhh.. their first real bite of battle. I watched as the lead one banked into a shallow dive, and started firing its machine guns into the mesas below, dipping out of sight. The next one peeled off, and dove at a second spot. The third banked, came around, took a very shallow dive, and hosed down the Mesa we were more or less in line from. The 11mm machine guns barked like dogs - four of them, in the nose.

I chuckled maniacally.

Cosmic: "Hm. Baptism by Fire seems to be going well." He rubbed his fetlock on his chin, just as a bullet whizzed between his raised foreleg, between the V made by his bent knee, cannon and his forearm, barely missing him. "YIKE!"

We got on our stomachs, as Dusty and the others opened fire into our blind spot.

Cosmic: "THAT was CLOSE!" He breathed. "I FELT that one!"

K: "That's nothing! For a blink, I could SEE it!" I grinned. "As we say on Earth, someone upstairs likes you!" I pet his mane, and we got up, leaning over the outcropping, and firing at the squad that had fired at us.

Quiet, again. This time for a good while.

Cosmic: "How's it going on up front, you figure?"

K: "Well.. I figure they're scared and taking casualties. We were only going to inspect sabotage - only because we've been caught flat-hoofed before, did we prepare for a fight. But we didn't expect the fight to already be here when we arrived." I shrugged. "They're trapped, now."

????: C> "This'us the enemy force calling General K." A sadistic, very pony-like voice over comms.

K: "Oh, shit." I shrugged. C> "Enemy leader, this is General K. I'm prepared to accept your surrender. You'll be treated fairly if you throw out your weapons and come quietly."

Sidewinder: C> "Nahw, Cuz. This here's Sidewinder Orchard.. we be related by marriage, you'n'I." He what? "Ah'm a callin' you out!"

Cosmic: "Oh, dear. He's not going to pull that one, is he?" His face scrunched up. "He wants a duel-"

K: "I know what he wants." I looked at Cosmic flatly, and sighed. C> "Sidewinder. Name your time and place. I'll need about twenty minutes to get back to my train and put on my gun belt."

Sidewinder: C> "Hm. Alright, thirty-five minutes, where the track crosses the wagon trail. Winner-take-all."

K: "He's going for a Hail Mary, as we say on Earth. An act of desperation - settle the fight in one move. Either that or we spend the next several hours, and possibly lives, digging his maniacs out of those rocks." I nodded. C> "Alpha Actual to all Callsigns from Stable to Arrowhead - cease fire and stand down. Alpha Command, meet at the train. Adam, Sierra, see to your wounded. Adam George Actual, meet me at the Train." I got up, and waved to the others on the cliffside.

Dusty: "THIS IS CRAZY, GENERAL! SIDEWINDER IS A WELL KNOWN GUNSLINGER, AND PIESLINGER BEFORE THAT! YOU'RE OUTMATCHED!"

Cosmic: "She cares." He humm'd thoughtfully.

K: "I already as much told her that if I ended up meeting her before Jackie, she'd be Dusty K--- right now." I shrugged a tiny bit, smiling slightly, as I moved out for the train.

The relationship between us was getting more complex. Her desperation.. the sound of worry in her voice.. it got to me. It wasn't just a casual comment.. there was something real, there.

But, for the moment, I had something else on my mind. A duel. A genuine, Western duel.

That poor sap had no idea...
