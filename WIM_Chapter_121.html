Part 1: Showdown in the Kirin Village

TIME: 08:14 NCT
DATE: War Day 928/22 Decemus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Kirin Village, Perilous Peaks, 297km NW of Palembang, Dutch East Indies

Behind me were 14 trained ponies, and a village full of Kirin that had foresworn violence and emotion for the better part of ten years, with zero military training.

Ahead of me was Tirek himself and a BRIGADE of troops.

A brigade. Roughly 3,500 monsters.

Dusk: "GOLDEN! CALL THIS IN! EVERYONE ELSE, DIG IN, GET DOWN, COVER THE KIRIN AND OPEN FIRE!" He said, slamming himself to the ground, and just.. rapidly firing as fast as he could.

Against just us lucky few.

Golden: C> "THIS IS ALHPA TO ANY CALLSIGN - CODE TEAL! CODE TEAL! WE NEED REIN'FORCE'MENTS, IMMEDIATELY! ENEMY DANGER CLOSE!" He dropped the mic, and whipped his rifle to his shoulder. "COME ON, MATE! COVER THE KIRIN!"

And our courage.

Broken: "AYE!" He shuddered out in a shakey yell. "COVERIN' FIRE!" He dove to a rock, popped up, and started firing.

It's one thing to be brave in the face of monsters. It's quite another to be brave in the face of Tirek himself. Celestia bless them, not one of them faltered.

Twilight: "SUNSET! ELEMENTS! NOW!" She hefted her Abrams with her magic and threw it down to help cover Dusk. "I'LL THROW A SHIELD!"

Sunset: "ON IT! COME ON, GIRLS!" She shouted to the others.

Me? And Rain Shine? We charged for Tirek directly.

K: "BRING IT ON, BIG BOY!" I had to distract him.

Queen Shine: "MAY EMINENCE PROTECT US!" She transformed into a Nirik.

We just needed time.

Time..

...time.

An energy blast that I can only describe as cataclysmic eminated from Tirek's Trident. While I was able to pierce through it and charge past it with the.. LANCE of Rainbow's Light.. it also wasn't deflected and reflected back at him.

He took a gamble.

I wasn't his target.

I could not afford to look back.

Shine and I took to the air instantly, and he began firing laser spells from his Trident at us. We circled around, and I chanelled her fire energy through the Lance and towards him in monstrous bolts of flame.

Despite the fact that he'd killed me once already, and killed Twilight once as well.. this.. this power.. made me feel like I wasn't at such a disadvantage any more.

Not equal. No, nowhere near that.

But I had a chance.

A chance.

Time.

We circled around him several times, firing blast after blast. He deflected them, but I could tell, he wasn't too eager to soak them. He'd erect momentary shielding, or swat them away with his Trident. Then he'd return fire.

Lasers.

Bolts from hands.

Beams from his eyes.

That sack.. why the sack around his neck? What was I forgetting..?

I wouldn't have time to think about it, as a bolt fired from his fist, finally hit its target - me. Us. And sent us flying through the air. Even though the Lance prevented us from being harmed by the spell itself, the kinetic force behind the spell, cost us our air mobility.

We hit the ground.

Very hard.

And rolled.

I sat up immediately, and looked around. The Lance reverted to the Sword of Rainbow's Light. I was bleeding from a scrape across my face. My arm was bruised.

Where was she?

I saw her - Queen Shine. Where she landed. She was on the ground, transformed back into a Kirin, in the middle of a rolling drag mark that ended in a crater.

She'd taken the brunt of it for me. Protected me.

I moved over to her, and lifted her head.

Queen Shine: *Ngh!* "M-My wing.." She winced.. blood gently drizzled from her mashed snoot. "..I am sorry, Human."

K: "Nothing to be sorry for." I caressed her cheek. "You did good." I looked up, and realized, all the Kirin were staring at me.

Cinder: "HUMAN! Wh.. what do we do!?" She pawed the ground.

Autumn: "WE FIGHT!" She yelled. "Look at that MONSTER!" She pointed to Tirek. "It's HIM or US! It was our emotions that burned the village down - it's those same emotions that are going to SAVE US NOW! I want you all to think.. what you would feel.. if you were used to HURT and KILL innocent lives! PLEASE!" She stood before them. "I know.. that makes me.. VERY ANGRY!"

She transformed with.. frighteningly little effort.

I moved ahead of her.

I had a plan!

K: "ALL OF YOU HAVE TO TRANSFORM!" I looked to Sunset. "ELEMENTAL JEWELS, FULL POWER, CHANNEL IT THROUGH THEM, AND YOU ALL CHANNEL EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT, THROUGH ME!"

Tirek: "THAT WILL NOT STOP.. THE RAINBOW OF DARKNESS!" He bellowed, moving aside from his troops.. even as the Kirin, transformed, one by one, into Nirik. He grasped the bag around his neck.

THAT'S WHAT I FORGOT!

He kept the Rainbow of Darkness in that SACK!

But then? The ground itself rumbled.

???: "BUT MY POWER CAN!"

The.. the earth itself spoke to us. The voice was all around us.

Tirek: "I-Impossible!" He was quickly trying to get the bag off of his neck.

Elevated Emenence: "I AM THE ELEVATED EMINENCE! FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, I HAVE SLEPT, AWAITING THE HUMAN OF LEGEND, TIREK! EVER WATCHFUL OVER MY KIRIN CHILDREN! YOU WILL NOT CARRY THIS DAY!"

Ohhh-hhohoho.. I could distinctly hear the sounds of the tables turning.

K: "EVERYTHING YOU ALL HAVE! NOW! NOOOOOOWW!!" I held the Sword of Rainbow's Light aloft. "ELEVATED EMINENCE, LEND ME YOUR POWER!"

The ground shook.

Fire raged all over and around us as the Nirik charged and emitted one mass fire wave.

Sunset: "NOW! HIT HIM!" She fired off the combined Elements of Harmony.. into my sword.. carrying the Nirik Fire with it.

Tirek: "TAKE THIS!" He managed to pull the Bag off and open it, facing us.

A great dark energy emitted from it - not just a negative rainbow, but a dark and inky thing, like a nightmare's worst horrors, screeching as it tore through the air. Screeches not of DEATH.. but UN-LIFE.

As for us?

The most.. beautiful rainbow I've ever seen.. poured from the combined energy channel behind me, into my sword, pulled a massive spire of energy from the ground..

..and fired it right at him.

The impact?

Oh, right, I didn't see it.

I just saw light.


TIME: UNKNOWN
DATE: UNKNOWN
LOCATION: UNKNOWN

I awoke in shining white nothingness once again.

I was seated at the feet of a stone giant about eight feet tall.

K: "Your.. Elevated Eminence?" I sat up, and pulled myself up.

Elevated Eminence: "I am, Human." He pulled me into his lap, like a child. "Listen carefully, as we haven't long. You MUST complete the Sword of Rainbow's Light AND find the Rainbow of Light if you hope to defeat him. On my blessed slopes, he carries no power now. For I have more strength than even his great Rainbow of Darkness. This will not always be. Nor can I follow you from these high hallowed stones. Together, those magical powers, and the Elements of Harmony can purify the Rainbow of Darkness, and add its strength to you. And with that, you can destroy him. Destroy him forever. As we had once asked."

K: "Once asked. But, Megan was just a child. She co.. she didn't have enough darkness in her heart to wantonly take a life." I nodded. "No matter how evil."

Elevated Eminence: "Indeed." He pat my shoulders. "Had she, she would have been trapped here forever - the Rainbow of Light would no longer have responded to her will."

K: "A noble sacrifice." I nodded. "Fitting. But.. but me?" I shrugged. "Even if I die here, I will likely be sent back to where I came, because of HOW I came to be here."

Elevated Eminence: "Indeed, Human." And nodded. "My children have given you the Nirik's Light. That is one more Blessing for the Sword. The other, you stole from Helreignn - the power of Flight. There are other Blessings. You will know, in your heart, when you find the last one." He gave my hair a little smudging. "You have done well. The Powers that Be in this world.. may not all trust you.. but none doubt your strength." He cleared his gravelly throat. "But, I am sided with Galactica Spark - Tirek must be destroyed, no matter the cost, as his NEXT return, he may be so powerful, no force on Equus might be able to stop him."

K: "It all comes down.. to us." I nodded.

Elevated Eminence: "It does. Now, go! Your friends call you - this battle is not yet won!"

He picked me up, and hefted me in one hand, rearing back like Nolan Ryan.

K: "Hoo boy.." I nodded. "DO IT!"

Elevated Eminence: "Tirek has fled the field, but he has left his minions. Go, Human! Destroy them, and save my children!"

With that, he THREW me..

..and the light got brighter..

..and then I woke up.

Part 2: Battle for Kirin Village

TIME: 08:33 NCT
DATE: War Day 928/22 Decemus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Kirin Village, Perilous Peaks, 297km NW of Palembang, Dutch East Indies


Dr. Allcome: "K! GET UP! GET UP!" He pulled me to my feet, and pushed a rifle into my hands. "COME ON! COVER ME!"

I did, not thinking. I rolled to a kneel partly behind a rock, and started shooting. Anything I could see. Duregar.. Porcine.. Goblins.. lots of Goblins.. mag empty, I flicked the rifle to the side as I hit the magazine release, and whipped a new mag into the mag well, slapping the bolt, and bringing the weapon to bear again. I fired.. more..

Golden: "ON YER LEFT, MATE!" He rolled to his belly, finishing a reload. "NOICE shot on Tirek! I think ye hurt him!" He leaned up, and fired off a few short bursts.

Broken: "No kidding..!" He was pulling Twilight's Abrams into position. "Eh.. EAT BELT FED!" And he let loose.

Dusk: "KEEP THEM OFF BALANCE!" He directed. I could hear him somewhere behind us, and not too far.

I could see Rose in the first APC, using the 11mm gun to cut swathes out of the enemy troops, like a scythe before the wheat. Gilda was on the other gun, but she'd pulled it out from its pintile mount, and had it dug in on its tripod, next to the APC that Rose was in. She was also, occasionally, throwing hand grenades from a large container of them.

Dr. Allcome: "I've got them up and moving! GIRLS! GET TO YOUR GUNS!" He said. "I'll get the Queen! Cover!"

Dusk: "You'll have it!" He barked. "BROKEN! Slide to your left, hold that section! I'll lend fire! Spike, get him another belt!"

Spike: "Right here!" He was moving nimbly, carrying two ammo cans. "MOM! Get the other Abrams!"

Twilight: "I'VE GOT IT! MOVING TO K'S RIGHT!" I heard her hooves galloping.

I was shaking the stars off, now. I got up, and moved back a bit, nearer to Dusk, and took cover behind a thick Palmetto log. I could snap off individual shots, now.

K: "This isn't looking good!" I called to Dusk.

Dusk: "NO KIDDING!" He huffed. "I'm running out of mana, here! I-" He fell over.

I saw a haze of red in my vision, and I knew he'd been hit.

K: "DUSK!" I slid over to him, and checked him. "RARITY! APPLEJACK! COVER!" I called out, and felt Dusk's foreleg - the round went through the meat at the shoulder. "Speak to me! Tell me your name so I can tell your mother!"

Dusk: "MY MOTHER knows my name!" He pushed me off, and got back up, shouldering his rifle with Horn telekinesis, since his non-dominant foreleg had a round through it, and he used that position to fire from.

K: "FLUTTERSHY!" I called out, and pointed to Dusk.

The Kirin were.. welll.. kinda unconscious. All of them. No help there.

She zoomed over, and grabbed his foreleg in hers, and wrapped it in a bandage, quickly.

Havoc: C> "HUNTER ACTUAL TO ALPHA!" I could hear that from Golden's radio pack.

So, I crawled over.

K: C> "Hunter Actual, Alpha Actual, five by five, we are under heavy fire from a full brigade of enemy forces. We are Teal-Black, but operational. Barely. We need everything you can get!" I said, as I leaned over and popped off a few more shots - the enemy were almost at bad breath distance.

Havoc: C> "Our ETA is FIVE! Call for Air Support!"

K: C> "Roger that! Alpha Actual to Tac Air!"

Finch One: C> "This is Finch One, rojah!"

K: C> "Finch One, I need an anti-personnel strike! Enemy troops in the open, all over my Poz! Drop your Ordnance as Final Protective Fire! My call!" I said, as I reloaded with one arm.

Finch One: C> "Rojah! Your call! We're gonna buzz the treetops! Keep yer heads down, lads!"

K: "COVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!" I yelled out to everyone.

They all rolled into whatever little hole they could find. Moments later, 12 Fairy Fulmar strike-fighters came in from our right. Machine guns and 25mm cannon fire started the strafe. As they passed over the enemy position, they dropped 45kg HE Bombs. Lots of them. Five each. 60 bombs, all throughout the enemy ranks. Bombs that split trees, and cut holes in the foliage.

Behind them, a flight of CFA-1 Firefoxes - another 12 planes, half of RCS Snow Dome's compliment - came in a bit lower than THAT and dropped their ordnance. Napalm. Lots and lots of Naplam.

Screaming.. lots of screaming.. as the rear sections of the Brigade were torn up by the high explosive bombs, shrapnel, and FIRE. The enemy assaults.. tapered off.

Between us 15 people.. we shot up whatever was left in our sight.

Havoc arrived in short order, just as the last shots were quieting down. His and Seven's teams dove into the bushes to eliminate any stragglers and hold-outs.

Me? I just rolled over on my back.

K: "That.. that was hard." I nodded.

Broken: "Aye, t'was.." He flopped on his side.

Golden: "S'trewth.." He shook his head, leaning over his rifle. "..bloody outta ammo, here!"

K: "Last mag." I held up my rifle weakly.

Spike: "Quarter belt, K." He said, panting, and slid over to me, and rest his head on my belly. "Sooo.. exhausted.."

K: "We almost had him." I nodded. "Spike, what did you see?"

Spike: "Uhm.. the Rainbows collided.. there was a big earthquake, but nothing.. like.. shook apart. And there was a big magical explosion. And Tirek was shaking off his right arm, and there was steam or smoke coming off of it." He sighed. "I think you hurt him."

Golden: "See? What'I'd tell ya!" He chuckled. "Maaan.. I need.. water.. sleep."

K: "Agreed." I said, as Havoc's face entered my vision.

Havoc: "Miss me, buddy?" He licked my face.

K: "It's a great war, wish you'd've been here." I chuckled a bit.

Seven: "We'll clean up the mess." He nodded, and took off with Havoc.

After we rested, I needed to see the Queen. But, that would wait. I was so exhausted, I wanted to fall asleep right here.

But, we had won. With an immense amount of magic, we fought off Tirek. With air strikes, we decimated his troops. With our own willpower and firepower, we held off the rest.

What a show.

[End of Part 2]


Part 3: Meeting at Kirin Village

TIME: 12:44 NCT
DATE: War Day 928/22 Decemus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Kirin Village, Perilous Peaks, 297km NW of Palembang, Dutch East Indies

1st Company, Ambleonian Royal Marines, and 2nd Company, Maritime Brigade, were now dug in at the village, with a platoon of Marine Raiders, all under Blinda's command. Havoc and Seven were providing close protection to us and the Queen. Steela, Teeka, and Lightning Dust had shown up with them.

In the battle, no joke, we expended 92% of the ammunition we'd brought with us, and we brought the equivalent of 5 loads per pony, plus lots of extra grenades and other things.

Everyone had gotten hurt somehow. All the Girls were affected by Magical Feedback from the Rainbow of Darkness. Dusk had been shot. Golden had been clubbed in hand-to-hand fighting. Broken had been bitten in the flank by a Goblin deep enough to draw blood. Gilda ate a bit of shrapnel. Rose ate some concussion from a grenade and was slammed against the side of one of the half-tracks. Dr. Allcome had rolled over rocks in one of the blasts. Twilight and Spike sustained injuries going toe-to-toe with a Porcine at close range.

Heck, that's how Broken Dawn ended up with Twilight's Abrams - it'd been knocked away from her, and his recovering it, he'd used it to finish off the Porcine that her and Spike had been fighting.

I was lucky. No one had died. Even among the Kirin, while there were injuries, there were no dead. Even the Queen, though she was in bad shape.

I had been forced to sleep after my wounds were tended to, with Steela resting her head on my torso. Teeka was running this way and that, trying to help everyone.

I was now up, and dressing in a new uniform. That's another set of rags to be thrown out.

I felt another twinge. That aborted timeline. In that one, I had no Rarity around to make me clothes, I recalled. I remember patching them myself with whatever I could find.

Steela: "You need full time body guard, K." She said, softly. "I.." She shook her head, frustratedly. "I did not defy Odin to not be at your side!"

K: "Promise, then." I wagged a finger at her. "You will not try to die nobly unless it's my call."

Steela: "Eh?!" She recoiled a bit.

K: "That's part of the reason I kept you at arm's length, Steela." I shrugged. "I know what you're like, what the rules are, all that." And shook my head. "You're looking for a noble death, worthy of a Valkyire." I stood right up to her. "I won't have a wasted life on my conscience."

Steela: "Heh.. heh-heh.." She lowered her head, a tear coming down her snout. "..know me too well, Human." And draped her head over my shoulder. "Jes. I promise. I swear this oath to you."

I hugged her, seeing Applejack come in. She was still woozy from the fight.

Applejack: "Mm." She slid up to me and kissed me. "Steela? How's our dear General doin', sugar cube?"

Steela: "Is no major injury, save his arm is bruised." She stepped back, blushing a bit, and smiling slightly.

Applejack: "GOOD!" She grinned wickedly. "Ah think our dear general.." She slid her tail up under my chin.. "..needs some more rest.." And snapped it to the side hard enough to produce a small whip-crack sound.

Wait. She's sober.

Oh no.

OH NO NO NO!

Steela: "Ah.. I-I will-" She turned to leave.

Applejack: *Seductive growl* "-Git his pants off."

OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!


TIME: 17:21 NCT

Well, that.. that was something. I did not expect Steela to.. 1) Actually be a complete virgin, even from her former life. 2) Be so tight, it felt like sliding into a latex slit. 3) Be gentle.

Yes, I was.. very much expecting a well flexed hole and a lot of Berzerker GF Dommy Mommy shit.

I got a delicate flower that wanted lots of cuddles. Applejack helped. She got everything she wanted. And then some. And we all enjoyed it. And we slept afterwards. And I'm awake and buried under some of the finest marepussy on the planet. And my hands are behind my back, and I'm grinning like a loon.

AJ did this for a reason. I might never really know why, but she had a reason.

Extraction from my current position wasn't EASY, but I did it. Then, I took a quick sponge bath and got dressed.

I was back in uniform, now, and went to find the others. Mainly-

K: "Twilight!" I paced over, and gave her a small hug. "You're not so rusty as you thought, huh?"

Twilight: "Heh. Guess not." She raised her head and grinned. "Raven just got here, we're going to go meet the Queen. She's been asking about you."

K: "Beat to shit, but I'll live. I need some time off. Nothing broken, THIS time, but I'm sore all over." I shook my head. "After this Campaign finishes, I want us in a cycle of rest and replenishment. We've worked the fleet and the marines pretty hard."

Twilight: "No problem. Maybe you can go to a few of the states and get these governments organized." She shrugged a bit.

K: "I'll help, sure." I rubbed my chin. "Remember, we promised Toola Roola we'd help her deal with her mom."

Twilight: "Oh, right!" She blinked. "I'd almost forgotten. Seacattle." She then nodded.

K: "I haven't." I shrugged. "Raven."

Raven: "Good to see you, K." She smiled broadly. "Looks like you survived."

K: "Survived? I'd call that my first actual 'win' against Tirek. Granted, that only happened because we had access to so much, magic, and the Queen let me ride her like a Dragoon, so, it was nowhere near an -even- fight, even so, it wasn't a -fair- one, and I was still at a disadvantage.." I shook my head. "..we got lucky."

Raven: "Better than someone dying. Again." She frowned a bit. "Come on."

So, we'd go meet up with the Queen of the Kirin..

Queen Rain Shine was in.. okay shape. Dr. Well Wishes was tending to her.

K: "Well." I nodded as I entered, and gave him a half-hug. "How is she?"

Well Wishes: "Hello, K. She's.. okay. She'll survive, and her magical power shall ensure a full recovery. It's not going to be a fast recovery, though, and she will need rest." He nodded.

K: "Can I see her?" I gestured.

Well Wishes: "Keep it brief." He nodded, and smiled. "You saved an entire species, today, K."

K: "Doing my best, Doc." I nodded, and stepped over to her.

She was.. bandaged up real good.

Queen Shine: "Human." She nodded to me.

K: "I met His Elevated Eminence." I smiled. "He calls you, his children."

Queen Shine: "..I am gladdened to hear such kind words." She smiled. "Thank you for saving my Kirin.." And shrugged a little. "You say you'll help us control our anger?"

K: "And put it to good use." I nodded. "There are better ways, Your Majesty."

Queen Shine: "Rain. Please." She bowed a bit.

K: "Then call me K." I nodded back.

Rain: "K." She smiled. "The legends were true. And I have full faith that you will save us all."

K: "It's not just me. It's all of you. I would never have won without all your help." I smiled.

Rain: "Indeed." She nodded a bit. "If there is anything we can do to help end this war even a moment sooner, you only need ask."

K: "Join us?" I shrugged. "Even a few Nirik could be a major game changer."

Rain: "I will grant my consent." She nodded a bit. "And any that wish, may do so."

K: "Works, Rain. That works. In exchange, I'll make sure we send you whatever you might need." I gestured towards the window. "There was some destruction out there."

Rain: "All can be mended." She nodded. "We are eternally grateful for all you can offer us."

K: "Then I'll leave it to the Prime Minister and Secretary of State to handle the details." I bowed slighlty. "Rest well, Rain."

Rain: "And you, K." She smiled warmly

Well, that was ONE problem handled! And now? We could start the process of final clean up and returning home.

Friendship won out over fear. Victory was ours. The Campaign in the East Indies was over, now that Surabaya had been captured as well.

Time to head home.

It was another hard-earned victory. Really, they all had been. This was one of the worst, though, between the Jungle fighting and the Kirin.

And now.. well.. victory celebrations.

K: "Dusk." I nodded to him, smiling. "First wound on duty in a while, eh?"

Dusk: "Yes, sir." He smiled back a bit. "It's nothing serious." And shrugged. "You think she'll like them?" He said, showing off his entreating gifts.

K: "Yes." I nodded. "Go on, man."

Dusk stepped up to her cabin with the flowers, chocolates, and in his clean uniform. And knocked.

Rarity: "Yes?" She was just getting into some clothes, and looked at the display, and.. blushed. "OH! Dusk!"

Me? I was around the corner and out of sight.

Dusk: "Rarity, I.." He shrugged a little. "..can I take you on a proper date? I mean.." I heard the flowers rustle.

Rarity: "D-Date!? Why.. Dusk, I-" She paused.

Dusk: "I should be honest about my feelings." He said, softly, softer than I'd ever heard him. "Rarity, I.. I'm really.. you make me so happy, I.. I want to court you properly. Like a Lady should be, and.. show you that I love you.."

Rarity: "I never thought you'd fall in love with me? I'm SUCH a FOOL! Stringing you along like this! You deserve so much better than a conflicted Mare like me..!" She said, and I could hear the sadness..

Dusk: "..oh." And I could hear his heart detonate like a hand grenade.

Rarity: "I.. Love wasn't in the plan! I had K and Applejack, the occasional dalliance with rich fools who were soon parted with their bits! You weren't supposed to come along so sad and noble and hurt like a stallion from one of my silly little books! Love is serious, it's a distraction, it's... something to lose." She sighed, deeply, sadly. "..don't know HOW I feel, darling!" And paused. "I am.. very attracted to you.. or.. the idea of you, I don't know.."

I didn't see Applejack at the other end of the deck, stepping up.

Applejack: "Then y'all should find out, Rarity!" She said, firmly. "Ah been seein' you two trade eyes the last WEEK.. t'say nothin' of how y'all were there for him when he done had it out with his dad." My wife paused, and lowered her tone. "Rarity, we been friends fer years. Been through thick'n'thin t'gether." I could hear her sigh a bit. "If'n I lets you run away f'rm this, I ain't jes' bein' a bad friend, I'm bein' a bad Alpha Mare. Dusk? Y'all take her out proper-like. Rarity? Y'all git all fancy up - K an' I'll join ya. Double date fer starters. See how it all goes."

Yes, because there's less romantic pressure with another couple along... very good, Jackie. I slid out as I heard Rarity and Dusk both agree, to get into some proper clothes. Fancy means we'd be going to downtown Palembang, to the Dutch Sector, where all the nice restaurants were.. probably more.


TIME: 19:31 NCT
LOCATION: Palembang, Sumatra, Dutch East Indies

Dusk looked handsome in his formal Royal Guard uniform. Rairty was in a gorgeous red dress that I'd seen her bring along on several trips and never wear. I was in my formal uniform and AJ was.. very flirtatiously in a denim skirt, and button down shirt with green material over the shoulders.

Of course, we all had our sidearms. Rarity's was on a back thigh holster.. basically a Garter Holster.

Dusk: "This place. Here." He nodded to one of the restaurants that was.. certainly filled with local flair. "Best food in the city."

Rarity: "I hope they have good wine." She smiled, hanging off his foreleg.

Dusk: "The best." He nodded. "There's only one place better in the East Indies, and that's back in Jakarta." He shrugged.

K: "It's been a long day." I nodded.

Dusk: "It has." He smiled. "We got this."

The restaurant maitre'd seated us immediately upon recognizing Dusk, and we had menus. Including a wine list.

Rarity was smiling.. so happy.. so broad and warmly.

Dusk was trying to remain stoic, but he.. he was smiling, too.

Applejack: *Whisper* "Ah think we dun good, hun."

K: *Whispering back* "You did this."

Waiter: "Greetings. You are ready, yes?" He bowed to us.

Dusk: "Rarity?" He graciously offered to have her go first.

Rarity: "The Sea Bass and the Deertail White." She handed off her menus.

Dusk: "Miss Applejack?" He nodded to her.

Applejack: "Mmm.. braised pork roast 'n Lung Salad." She nodded. "And that.. Kirin Beer y'all got."

Waiter: "Ah, yes.. the Kirin Beer is a very exclusive brew, made by the Kirins. Is not quite a beer, but we call it this." He bowed a bit.

K: "I see." I nodded with a grin.

Dusk: "K?" He nodded to me.

K: "Water Buffalo Prime Rib." I nodded. "Baked sweet potato." I looked up. "And the black tea."

Dusk: "I'll have the Black Hen with White Rice." He handed over his menu. "I think-"

Rarity: "-he'll have the wine as well." She smirked a tiny bit.

HE BLUSHED!

Waiter: "Very good." He bowed to us. "Will be very quick!" And scampered into the back, making noise in his local language for them to get the lead out, as Dusk was a VIP.

Rarity: "This is a wonderful place, Dusk." She said softly. "I'm.. quite sure.. you know many other fine places."

Dusk: "I-I do.." He nodded, still blushing.

Rarity: "You'll have to take me to all of them. When this dreadful war is concluded and we are the victors." She trailed off, looking at her water glass, and gently stirring it.

Dusk: "I-I'd.. I'd love to. It. I mean.." He was off kilter.

Rarity: "I.." She turned a bit towards him. "..can see you in a different light, now." And smiled warmly, her lipstick making this almost look devilish. "I like what I see.."

In other words, keep it up.

As far as keeping it up? She lasted half way through dinner before she was drunk. She had way too much of the wine, calling it a refeshingly crisp white. She and Dusk chatted endlessly about their pre-war travels, and about her exploits since it started.

They absolutely hung on each other's every words.

Applejack had about two beers (enough for that buzz she needed) and stopped halfway through the third one.

Rarity: "Oh, Applejack.. darling.. ca.. can I taste yours?" She smiled, bubbles practically popping over her head.

Applejack: "Sho'nuff." She passed it over.

Rarity didn't sip, she drank the whole thing, and smiled.. she had consumed 3/4ths of the bottle of wine (which was close to a Fortified Wine in strength), and now, half of a tall boy, more or less.

She giggled.

Rarity: "Re-remember.. when.. hic.. you found out K had been with Lyra?!" She sniffled a bit, giggling.

Applejack: "Aw, Rares, that was years ago!" She was smiling, too.

Rarity: *HEHEHEH-SNORT* "Ohhhhh! Ya should'a seen'ya, a'yup!" She pointed at both of us, and fell over laugh-snorting.

K: "Rarity..?" I cocked a brow.

Dusk: "Miss Belle." He smiled a bit, and knelt next to her. "Do you need a hoof?"

Rarity: "Oh.. thaaasshhhh right neighborly of you, don'cha'kno!"

Applejack: "RARITY!?" Her jaw hit the floor.

Rarity: "Oohh.. psssfhhhhshhh. Jackie.." She slid up and over to her. "..you think'ai don' know how ta farm!?"

K: "..that accent is Minnesotan." I blinked.

Dusk: "Whinnysotan. Sir." He smirked, the scar lifting his lip just a bit.

K: "Seriously?" I nodded, watching AJ and Rarity try to talk to each other.

Dusk: "I think it's time we got them back to the ship." He nodded.

And.. with some effort.. we did.

I'd get Rarity's goat about her accent, later.

I know for a FACT that poor Dusk did not escape the evening unharmed. I know I sure didn't.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Christened upon White Waves

TIME: 09:44 Neighpon Standard Time
DATE: War Day 933/27 Decemus, 1004 C.S. (Equestrian Calendar)
LOCATION: HMS Cloudsdale, 520nmi north of Neighpon, enroute to Equestria


For the trip back, we changed to the Cloudsdale, as it had a larger command area, and we could just.. stretch out and relax. Rarity and Dusk were.. VERY MUCH an Item now.

Dusty and AJ were all over me, in exchange. As was Luna.

Elsie: "That was.. amazing. How long was that Campaign?!" She was looking up from her notes.

K: "Twenty eight days." I shrugged. "Or there abouts."

Elsie: "A whole month." She blinked.

Lightning Dust: "You.. you sure you want me in permanently, K?" She said, wringing her hair out from her shower.

K: "I need another pilot." I shrugged. "You and Blizz." I nodded to her.

Blizzardly Snowbound: "Never.." She shook her head. "..have I been so hot and uncomfortable."

K: "Happens." I shrugged. "We have no idea what's coming, next, or when it'll come. We know there's another Rainbow Factory out there somewhere that we have to stop. And we need to go BACK to the Fortress.. or find some clue about where the Rainbow of Light went!" I shrugged. "Remember what the Elevated Eminence said - we need both. And we're a little short on Intel."

Olivine: "Well, we'll figure it out." She nodded.

Broken: "Aye." He smiled a bit. "'Tis a fine adventure. Been nice to relax the last few days."

Golden: "Aye, mate. It's important to rest." He nodded. "Ya go full steam ALL the time, ya burn out, roight?"

K: "Exactly. Which is why I'm prescribing a two week rest once we get back to Equestria. The war is important, but we can't War if we're at the end of our rope." I shrugged.

Luna had fallen asleep.. mostly on top of me.

Rapid: "Good idea." He nodded. "Any particular rules on that?"

K: "No, not really. If you're not going to be in Canterlot or Ponyville, let me know where you'll be, though. Just in case." I nodded to him. "Thinking of going back to Ariezona for a bit?"

Rapid: "Mhm. Got some friends and folks out there." He nodded.

K: "Yeah. Just be back two weeks after we arrive back in Canterlot." I nodded. "I mean, I know we find trouble-"

Chemical Lens: "With frightening regularity, General." She smiled, though.

K: "-but let's not make it too easy on them." I nodded. "Toola?"

Toola: "I'll probably hang around the town." She was painting casually, now.

K: "Mmm." I nodded. "After the two weeks are up, you'll all be back on duty. For you new folks, that means reporting to Fort Defense every morning and staying in the city until the afternoon. Put in some hours, then go get some dinner and rest. Do whatever you need to - arrange supplies, tinker with inventions, research ideas or intelligence, organize the stuff needed for your job in CAG. Blizz will show you what that means, L-D. Rapid? That means making sure you have whatever supplies on-hand you and Wallflower and Olivine think you need to do whatever you think you have to do. Ambrosia left very full notes, take a look at them and see if you need anything more. Other than that, we investigate whatever we can until we produce a lead. Then, I select a team, and go after that lead."

Lightning Dust: "Sounds.. pretty good, actually." She shrugged. "I suppose we have free reign to practice anything we need or want?"

K: "Yep. And if that means taking a plane out or something, just go to the Fort Defense Air Station Annex. They have spare aircraft just for CAG." I nodded.

Maud: "And I?" She blinked.

K: "You want in, Maud?" I shrugged. "You never found Cotton Candy."

Maud: "Yes. Please." She blinked again.

K: "Then for you, study. You're going to stand for your exams." I wagged a finger at her.

Maud: "Indeed." She didn't smile, but she seemed pleased. "Boulder thanks you."

K: "Does Boulder like his new friend?" I shrugged - Elevated Eminence had gifted me a stone for Maud.

Maud: "I believe they are speaking of marriage." She tilted her head at me.

K: "Oh, that's serious!" I blinked. "Love at first strike?"

Maud: "Something of that nature, yes." She nodded a tiny bit.

Rose: "WEDDING PARTY!" She beamed a grin.

Toola: "Sounds like fun, Pinkie." She smiled.

Fluttershy: "I'll just be glad to get back home. I'm sure Harmony and the others, miss me." She nodded, with a smile.

Broken: "Who's Harmony?" He asked, seated at one of the tables, playing chess with Dr. Allcome.

Fluttershy: "She's.. my special friend." She blushed, but it was a very warm and happy blush. "K found her for me. My first really special friend, Angel.." She swallowed. "..he died.. to protect me from Tirek."

K: "If you saw the wicked scar on his right hand, that was Angel." I smiled, wistfully. "He was just a little bunny. But, he fought, too." I nodded firmly.

Twilight: "Actually, he saved us all. Not just Fluttershy. Tirek would've killed us, if he'd had the chance." She shrugged a bit. "Angel gave us a slim chance. We survived."

K: "Yeah." I smirked a little. "He was a good friend."

Vigilance: "We've lost too many of those." He nodded from his wheelchair.

Colgate: "And some of us keep getting themselves hurt!" She snorted at him. "Maybe this broken leg'll keep you contained for a few weeks. WE need you at home. ALIVE."

Golden: "Oi, really?" He smirked. "Ye got two shielas?" He leaned hard into his accent and Yorkshire culture with that.

Vigilance: "Mhm. And the other one's pregnant." He smirked. "I get hurt almost as much as K does."

Dr. Allcome: "Check." He nodded. "Yes, you do! I think there's only been ONE operation where you haven't - Konzas."

Vigilance: "Yeah." He smirked.

Norfy: "At least this operation is over." He shrugged. "The Dutch Marines and Colonial Infantry can handle the rest. Plus, the Dutch reinforcements."

Cosmic: "Yeah." He smiled. "That was a tough one, but the casualties were pretty low, all things considered."

Gaze: "Could'a been werse." He shrugged. "Much. Our forces're gettin' tha' experience they needin' - an' in spades."

K: "We'll be ready when the time comes." I nodded slowly.

Broken: "...MATE!" He snapped his Knight down.. and smiled.

Dr. Allcome: "Hm? OH! I didn't even see that." He shrugged. "Well, that's 7 for 7. We.. need a tiebreaker."

And friendships grow and expand. Now, Broken was getting to know Dr. Allcome, who started out as a timidly doctor from Manehattan, and was now CAG's Chief of Medicine. We were growing in strength with each passing day.

Sooner or later, Tirek was going to run out of options and room to maneuvre. Victory was inevitable.

We just needed time.
