Part 1: Rocky Expedition

TIME: 07:44 ERST
DATE: War Day 855/9 Octavius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Quirtbeck Border

The train stopped rather suddenly. We were lurched forwards out of our bunks. I held Dusty close to me, and took the fall myself. To be honest, we were.. kinda awake. We didn't want to get out of bed, was all. I rolled to my feet, and went for my pants.

K: "SOMEONE TALK TO ME!" I called towards the front of the train as I got my pants zipped up, and threw my gunbelt over my shoulder, feet into boots.

Dusty just grabbed her Grant rifle, with a spare mag strapped to the magazine in the gun. Nude? Ponies go nude all the time.

Norfy: "We'll find out in a minute!" He called back.

I got my A-Frame on, and cinched my gunbelt. Dusty bothered with pants and her own A-Frame. We moved into the next train car, which was an officer's bunk car. Everyone was fallen over. I grabbed Flash Sentry and helped him up, handing him a Grant from the wall rack.

K: "Grab a rifle, get outside! Cosmic, Gaze, get to the engine!" I called out, and moved to the exterior door.

I got outside, and drew my Dager pistol, two-handing it as I moved quickly towards the engine. Flash was taking the rear, and Dusty was behind me.

To the sides was a rock wall, as we were travelling through a mountainous area in Greenbroke to get to Quirkbeck. We had about five meters of free space. I hugged the train itself, letting the wider ponies behind me have better room to fire, if needed.

The rock wall ended at about the front train car. Dusty and Flash went wide immediately, and Babs popped out of the door hefting a Ridgway SMG, falling in behind Flash without a word.

The broken terrain to our right had lots of spaces to take cover, and the the three ponies took advantage of that. As soon as I approached the engine, though..

K: "Steamer! Shovel! What's going on up there!?" I asked, grabbing the-

*ZIP! of a near-miss shot*

K: "SHIT! COVER! COVER!" I fell back on my ass.

Babs: "SHOOTER, ROCK WALL, LEFT FRONT, FIFTY METERS!" She hosed the area down with her SMG, even though it was close to the edge of the weapon's effective range, making them duck down.

Flash: "INFANTRY IN THE OPEN, FRONT RIGHT!" He started shooting with his Gale assault rifle, taking precise three-four shot bursts.

Dusty: "K! IT'S AN AMBUSH!" She started shooting as well, to the right flank.

What the HELL happened here that we were being attacked RIGHT on the Quirtbeck border!? Cosmic and the lads came up, with Katrina, who immediately cast a defensive Sigil into the ground, to dull the enemy's fire, before firing her Buckner shotgun (the stalwart Chaffee's replacement) to the right flank.

Gaze: "Issa ambush, suh!" He handed me a Gale and a bandolier.

Cosmic: "I have La Selle on the line, sir." He handed me the mic.

K: C> "Cognac, this is Alpha, report status and position." I called in.

Col. La Selle: C> "Alpha, this is Cognac Three Six. We are five hundred meters to your north, and taking fire from an enemy formation, motor infantry, identified as a mixed force of Pony, Gizmonk, and Camel." I could hear gunfire over the radio. "Air assets identified as Epee One through Six are en route from Montreal, ETA six minutes. Over!"

K: C> "Roger that, Cognac. Do what you can, we're too far apart to get a coordinated front going. Take priority for the air assets!"

Col. La Selle: C> "Oui, Alpha!"

Norfy: "They're pinned down, too? Not good." He hefted his rifle, and moved to join the others on the right flank, dropping an Ice Shield to the front, enough to cover himself, Babs, and Katrina as he repositioned.

I popped up, and sighted in on the rock wall. That sniper was still shooting, and I aimed to shut them up. Iron sights aren't the best for long distance shooting, but some can work magic with them. Not me. I'm above average, but not a miracle worker. I managed to get the sniper - a Zebra - in my sights, and tugged off several shots towards his head area. One hit, and he fell from the rock wall.

Cosmic was joined by Twilight and Spike. Twilight set up her Abrams machine gun on its tripod, and immediately started pouring fire to the front right, suppressing the enemy there and denying them movement.

I patted Cosmic to go take position with her, and moved to the right flank, with Dusty, Norfy, and Flash. We raised up at the same moment as I arrived, and started firing down on the enemy, putting targets in sights, and pulling the trigger as fast as we could. I ducked down to reload, and the enemy return fire started chipping rock all over us.

Flash: "I'm glad I insisted on coming with.." He grunted.

K: "Be glad I took you - I didn't have an offical Royal Guard Liasion since Sunshine left the team." I patted his shoulder. "You're doing good." I looked at both of them. "Ready?"

Norfy: "One sec." He summoned up about a dozen ice daggers, and nodded.

We whipped up and did it again - firing on the enemy as we could get targets in our sights, with Norfy's ice daggers flying true, and almost decapitating their targets.

More infantry were coming across the border from the far right, over a ridge that more or less defined the border itself. They moved in practised teams, giving cover fire as best they could. They didn't have belt-fed weapons, just rifles. They looked like Nasser rifles, which bothered me.

K: "TWILIGHT! REPOSITION!" I ordered, pointing to a small rise with some knee-height granite rocks jutting up fromt he ground. "COVER THE EMM-GEE!"

We all reloaded, and then poured fire in all directions as Twilight magically lifted the ENTIRE machine gun with attached tripod, and brought it with her to the new position, with Spike and Cosmic grabbing the extra belts. She wasn't able to lift THAT much weight before.

Webley and Coconut Cream got out of the weapons car with a Browning heavy machine gun, with Gorcat carrying spare belts, and they made haste to our position.

K: "OVER THERE!" I pointed to a depression at the left flank (for us, the train tracks) that gave a commanding view of the left, front, and front right sides, as the depression was still higher in elevation than the front right side.

Webley: "Right!"

She, being a Pegasus, was having a bit of a time with the heavy weapon, but Coconut got the tripod down, and when Webley swung the weapon over her shoulder, she secured it in the slot on the tripod, and locked it in place.

Reminder, of course, that Paratroopers aren't meant to carry or use heavy machine guns - their Weapons units were armed with Abrams medium machine guns, and Funstons. Brownings were only mounted on Airborne Mechanized vehicles.

Gorcat: "This should be fun!" He dropped the spare belts down next to the gun, and whipped his own Merrill Commando machine gun up from behind him, and firing while advancing towards cover near us.

We covered them as well. Once the Browning started opening up on clusters of troops, the deafening thump of 11mm NEIGHTO started scaring the enemy. They froze.. then started trying to cover their retreat with additional fire.

Teddy opened up at that moment, and started picking off anyone putting their heads up from thicker cover. I heard his Timberwolf bark, and watched a Gizmonk head explode like an overripe melon.

Thick, heavy fire towards the enemy increased as the others got out of the train with more ammo, grenade launchers, and Blinda running out with two Funstons, and firing one at an enemy concentration behind a low rock wall, and the other at a squad just coming over the rise. She dropped both launchers, whipped up her Grant, and dove next to me.

Blinda: "Great time, K!" She beamed. "You always take a girl on the best dates." She passed out spare mags.

Dusty: "Damn straight, girl." She whipped up and popped off three shots, resulting in a scream. "Oo.. he's gelded."

Katrina: "It feels good, though." She popped off two shots. "I feel like I'm finally helping." She patted me on the shoulder, and cast a Fireball Rain spell to our right flank - area denial.

Lyra: "OI! K!" She yelled from on top of the train. "THEY'RE BREAKIN' AN' RUNNIN'!"

K: "CUT FIRE VOLUME! EMM-GEES ONLY!" I slid down a bit, and felt myself up - my arm was cut open from a rock fragment, nothing serious. "Well, fuck."

Cosmic: "K!" He motioned to me.

I crawled over to Twilight's MG nest, and grabbed the Mic from him.

K: C> "This is Alpha! Go!"

Col. La Selle: C> "Cognac Three-Six reporting, the enemy broke and ran as soon as air cover showed. Orders?"

K: C> "What's your status?" I called back, asking for casualties.

Col. La Selle: C> "Two wounded, no dead. Over."

K: C> "Leave a Medic and a Security, pursue the enemy. Run them to ground and try to take prisoners." I called back.

Col. La Selle: C> "Oui, Alpha."

K: "Norfy, Cosmic, Gaze, Dusty, Babs, Gorcat, on me!" I pointed, as Dusty pulled my arm down so she could get a bandage over my wound. "Shovel! Steamer! You guys okay up in there!?" I called to the Engine.

Coal Shoveller: "We're okay, General!" He called back.

As a matter of honor, train crew were never armed, and were intended to be treated properly by whomever takes over said train. In return, train crew were to comply with the new train owner's instructions. Since trains were complex machines, train operators were supposed to be treated as neutral parties. I wasn't entirely sure all of our enemies would do so, but at the same time, I didn't want my train engineers shooting back while trying to work a train.

We got up, and once we got some more ammo, we got ready to move.

K: "Webley, Coco, Blinda, Teddy, Lyra, Bon-Bon, follow us after ten minutes, sweep to the north and try to link up with the Legion. Arm up good. Twilight, you take command here, make sure the train isn't damaged and get ready to move out." I ordered.

Twilight: "You got it." She nodded.

I pulled Babs close to me, and put a finger in her face.

K: "That was very good, but you stay right next to me for this, and follow our orders to the letter, got it?" I reminded her.

Babs: "Yes, ser!" She smirked, but nodded, reloading her SMG.

She was one of the last ones to be using one, and it was more that it was available and she wasn't QUITE ready for a full Gale Assault Rifle. She could USE one, but she'd trained with the Bradley-Ridgway-Chaffee generation of weapons.

Her first taste of fire, and she did well.

I wished everypony could be as good.

Part 2: Running to Ground

TIME: 07:56 ERST
DATE: War Day 855/9 Octavius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Quirtbeck Border

I hefted myself up the broken terrain, immediately noting the Ponies' natural advantage here, but using my hands to pull myself along when needed. We got up to the rise in the terrain that more or less marked the border, and I got a look over the side.

Down on the bottom of the rise were twelve.. call them trucks, but they more reminded me of very early steam engines with large passenger cabins on them. The engines were side-mounted, and were clearly some kind of steam boiler, with a reciprocating mechanism similar to an early steam train engine driving the wheels, which were oversized road wheels.

Babs: "Odd lookin' trucks, ser." She snorted.

K: "Indeed. That's not Tirek." I scanned the area, and noted there were a few running back for the trucks, and the trucks had security around them. "Gaze, you've got a Launcher. Put an egg on that lead truck. Gorcat, hose down the rear one. Everyone else, keep their heads down. I want to deny escape and capture them, got it?"

Everyone nodded affirmative.

Gaze lined up his launcher, and fired a grenade into the front carriage truck, and it exploded immediately. Gorcat popped up, and hosed down the rear one, causing a small steam explosion, killing three. The rest of us started sniping anything moving, but intentionally shooting a bit wide. I waved my hand after a moment.

K: "YOU DOWN THERE! SURRENDER! YOU'RE THROUGH!" I yelled down towards them.

After a few moments, I saw weapons being thrown away and hands (or hooves) being raised and the surrendering troops standing up.

K: "Cover me." I motioned, and got up as the backup team arrived.

Babs came with.. following my orders, actually. I advanced on the enemy soldiers, and kept my Grant aimed at them.

K: "Who's in charge, here?" I asked, demandingly.

Zebra: "I am.. I guess." Typical Jersey Shore accent. "What'chu want, human?"

K: "Come over here. I want to talk." I nodded.

Zebra: "..t'ch! Fine!" She moved up alongside the others, and came forwards, sitting down in front of me. "What'dy'a want?"

K: "Who sent you? What is your objective?" I asked, simply.

Zebra: "Who sent us? We're mercenaries." She shrugged, narrowing her eyes at Babs. "You sendin' lil' kids after us, now?! P'sh. Youz're harder up'n we thought!" With a small chuckle.

Babs: "I could carve d'at hide from yer bones, 'fore you'c'n blink, ya striped bitch." She delivered that in a determined deadpan.

K: "Babs." I corrected her. "She's a cadet. Getting blooded. So, when she commands her own team, she'll know how to pop heads on people like you." A shrug. "You didn't answer my question."

Zebra: "Yeah?" Sass. "T'ch'really?" More sass. "Maybe I don't feels like it?!" She leaned in.

Babs looked to me, and I held her back. The others came up and started picking up the enemy weapons, and escorting the prisoners off, back across the rise, to the train.

K: "Mmm." I shrugged, and gestured to her. "I mean, I could just torture the information out of you. You're mercenaries.. I don't HAVE to treat you fairly."

Zebra: "Y'think I care?" She snorted. "I looks at t'ings like 'dis. I got got, right? You win, I go back home, I'mma be treated like shit. You lose, I get executed straight off, I'm lucky. You torture me? So's what. It hurts, maybe I die, but I'll come back wit' scars, provin' I ain't no snitch."

K: "Interesting." I nodded slightly. "So, you feel as though you have nothing to lose?"

Zebra: "'Zactly." She sat proud, and looked me right in the eye.

K: "Alright." I shrugged. "Babs, bring her."

Babs got behind her, and we escorted the Zebra over to the others. Sacquet's team - led by La Selle - arrived at about the same time, with their own prisoners.

K: "Where's Phillipe?" I asked her.

La Selle: "Being a General." She smiled warmly. "Currently, he is ensuring the other Legion regiments in the Legion Brigade are trained. So, I am here instead."

Dusty: "Come a long way from a supply lieutenant, Juli." She poked her shoulder.

La Selle: "Oui. And fianced." She bowed. "Sanks to General K."

Capt. Gorton: "General." He nodded to me, then Gorcat. "Nephew."

Gorcat: "Uncle." A nod back. "I've had Eggs. You're a Great Uncle, now."

Capt. Gorton: "Mm." A curt nod.

Sgt. Maj. La Boche: "Mon Marechal!" He puffed out his chest, with a beaming grin.

Sgt. Gasconade: "Seems we meet with friends in Quirtbeck once again, oui?" He nodded to us.

Cpl. Maj. Zorola: "Gen'ral." She nodded to me, and moved over to the Zebra prisoner. "Hey, sis."

Zebra: "What'chu doin' hea'h?!" She seemed surprised.

Zorola: "Fightin' wit' da Legion." She crossed her AA.1 machine gun over her shoulders, and leaned into it, on her hind legs. "Looks like you ended up Merc'ing." She looked at me. "Dis' is my sistah, Corazi."

K: "Corazi, nice to meet you." I nodded to her.

Corazi: "PISS THA' FUCK OFF, YA FUCKIN' BASTID HU-" She got the AA.1 smashed across her muzzle for that.

K: "Family affair! I ain't touching this." I just.. stepped back.

Zorola: "You watch'yer tongue. K's one'a da good ones, see? Real good. Weren't fer him, I'd still be up in'dese woods, hea'h, choppin' trees 'n gettin' eaten by Smooze." She set her AA.1 down and lifted her sister up in her hooves. "What'cha doin' here?! Who's'se else's wit'cha?! WHO'SE BITCH ARE YA?!"

Corazi: "FUCK YA!" She spat blood in Zorola's face. "You dumb whore! What'cha sidin' wit'dem fer?! We git paid twice what'cher gettin!!"

Zorola: "'Cuz, unlike you, sis.." She dropped her on the ground. "I c'n actually look myself in 'da mirror every mornin' an' not see a piece'a shit starin' back at me." She narrowed her eyes at her. "Or have you forgotten!? Kwa kila uovu unaofanya, nafsi yako inapunguzwa kwa kipimo." She spoke to her in a language I.. actually didn't recognize.

It was Swahili, actually, as I found out later. She was reminding her sister that by aiding Tirek, she was draining the 'goodness' form her soul with every evil act.

Corazi: "Oh, fuck all'a'dat nonsense!" She snorted. "Dad believed - look't what it got 'im?! A fuckin' dirt house 'n a dirt plot wit' scrabbly weeds!"

Zorola: "Yeah? Got him an honest day's work, an' put food in YER mout', didn't it?!" She yelled back.

This was kinda.. worse than Pinkie's family, in a way.. it reminded me of Zecora and her cousin.

Corazi: "Yeh.. only after you put somethin' else in yers!" She gave her a cruel smirk.

Zorola whipped her right hoof across her sister's face hard enough, we could hear SOMETHING crack.. I was pretty sure it was Corazi's snout.

Corazi: "Fff.. uck.. you.." She winced.

Zorola: "I'm'a tell everyone back home you jumped all ova' an' sucked his big, thick monkey cock like a fuckin' freak, an' tried to Mate Poach." She gripped her in one hoof, the other reared back. "See how's they thinks'a youze, then!"

Corazi: "You BITCH! HOW COULD YOU!? You wouldn't DARE!" She glared at Zorola.

Zorola: "I woulds." She dropped her like a sack of shit on the ground. "K deserves a bettah class'a P-O-W 'dan youze skanky ass. Yer gahbige!! GAHHHRBIGE!!"

Corazi: "YA DUMB BITCH!" She started crying.

Zorola: "What kinda gaahbige gonna puke from yer whore mouth, now!?" She reared back, and sassed at her.

Corazi: "Ahhh.. FUCK! YOU BRAND ME LIKE THA-" She cried out.

Zorola: "Ain't no Stallion gonna come'a'chin TWENTY METERS OF YA!" She pointed at her.

Corazi: "Fack you! FACK!" She dropped into a heap and sobbed.

K: "Is mate poaching that big of a deal in Zebra society? I asked.. the rest of the crowd.

Twilight: "Actually, it is. It's on the same level as murder, since you're stealing the 'life' of two people - the two mates' lives are forever tainted by the act, the victim is seen as having lost part of their soul, the poached mate is seen as weak to sins of the flesh, and the poacher is seen as someone who puts their own selfish desires above everyone else - family, herd, Zebrakind.." She shrugged.

Zorola: "Yer choice!" She kicked her, but not nearly as hard as she could have.

Corazi: "WHAT choice?!" She spat back.

Zorola: "Come clean, Celestia-Damnit!" She crossed her arms.

Corazi: "I.." She looked at her sister, then to me.. then to Colonel La Selle.. then she curled up into a ball. "..f-f-fuck.."

K: "Bring her to my command car." I ordered, solemnly.

Cosmic, Flash, and Dr. Allcome dragged her away. I had my head down, and waited until she was way out of earshot before looking at Zorola, in the eyes.

K: "You were going to completely destroy her, weren't you?" I had my arms crossed as I stared at her.

Zorola: "Yeh." She bent down to pick up her AA.1, and nodded to me. "Legion's my family, now. Not her." She shrugged a little. "Da fuck do I care, she never gets a mate?" She smirked a little, and paced over to me. "Besides." She bowed to me.. and Dusty, who, I realized, was right next to me. "Accusin' her of Mate Poachin' you? You're pretty much da highest Alpha Male in North Equus.. bet'cha didn't know 'dat!"

K: "I.. didn't.. but, I had some idea." I shrugged.

Zorola: "I accuses her of tryin' ta' mate poach ya? May as well accuse her of tryin'a murder her own family. Ya DO NOT try ta poach a Princess' mate." She smirked deeply, and patted me on the shoulder. "Thanks fer playin' along."

K: "Any time." I gestured with open palms. "Alright, let's see what she has to say. Secure the prisoners over here. Norfy, Gaze, re-sort the ammo, and make sure everyone's got full loads. It's.. a good thing we brought extra." I chuckle-snorted.

Blinda: "No kidding." She poked me in the chest as she walked by. "Next time, we bring a Company of Marine Raiders."

Lyra: "Aye.. or Rangers." She smirked at Blinda.

Webley: "Or Airborne." She puffed up her chest.

K: "Or maybe just a mixed formation of the best soldiers in Equestria. Real Equestrian Heroes! Give 'em code names so Tirek can't figure out who they are. We can call them.. ohh.. G.I. Pony?" I peeked a cheeky grin. "Webs, we'll change your name to Duke!"

Webley thumped my arm, and gave me an annoyed/angry/frustrated look.

Webley: "REALLY, K!?" She WAS grinning, though.

Now.. to interrogate the prisoner.

K: "Make sure she gets some water." I said, entering the command car.

Cody: "Oh, she's been watered. She also has a fractured snout. In three places." He shrugged, disapprovingly, but understandingly.

K: "Talk." I said to her.

Corazi: "First, what'chu gonna do ta' me?" She was tied to a chair.

K: "Tell me what I want to know, I send you and your prisoner friends to Carousel Island for the rest of the war." I shrugged. "After the war, you go home."

Corazi: "..fair." She snorted a bit, though the right side of her face was swollen. "We got hired by one'a dem Arabesque nations. Infiltrate Equestria, lock down 'da bordah here, 'nother team's goin' up north for somethin' - but I don't know what."

K: "When did you arrive?" I rest my hands on my hips.

Corazi: "Yestahday." She shrugged. "Them trucks ain't so fast, but they save the hooves, ya dig?"

K: "I dig it." I nodded slowly. "So, then. Just rifles?"

Corazi: "Yeh, an' sub-machine guns." She shrugged. "Why?"

K: "Just asking. Did they expect you to stop the train with just small arms fire?" I tilted my head.

Corazi: "Ahh.. 'dey didn't say nothin' about no train." She looked down. "..fackinhell.. we was just a-a speedbump!!" She sneered. "Fuckin' bahstids.." She looked up at me. "I think I knows who's callin' th'shots."

K: "Yeah?" I shrugged. "Who?"

Corazi: "I think it's the Sultan of Oghuz." She nodded, looking down at the ground.

K: "And that revelation-"

Corazi: "He feckin' hates non-camels. Period. Us dyin' up here? He wouldn't give a fuck." She spat those words out.

K: "I see. So, what do you want to do?" I shrugged, more or less asking if she wants us to throw her in prison for the rest of the war, or pop her here and now so she doesn't have to bear the shame of being a snitch.

Corazi: "I want in." She said after a very long pause.

I gave it a thoughtful look.

Cosmic: "She can't.. K, you can't be serious!" He tugged my sleeve.

K: "Doc, can you fix her fractures up?" I looked at him.

Cody: "They'll heal on their own.. they're not too severe, but they will cause her pain for several weeks." He shrugged, as Dusty came in.

K: "Dusty, get her some gear." I nodded to Corazi. "Flash, untie her."

Flash: "Are you serious, sir?" He looked at me, but complied.

Once she was untied, and got on her four hooves, I moved in and gently grabbed her jaw.

K: "You fuck me over, I will have Lord Sombra suck out your soul." I stated firmly.

Corazi: "I'mma Merc.. an' I'm doin' this fer free." She stated, firmly, back.

Dusty: "Eh.. if she turns on us, I'll just beat her to death, if her sister doesn't do it first." She smirked.

K: "Get her squared away." I nodded. "Welcome to the NEIGHTO Army, Corazi."

Corazi: "Thanks.." She sighed, and followed Dusty.

After she left, and we moved the furniture back where it belonged, Cody spoke up.

Cody: "I am glad to see that diplomacy does still work sometimes." He sighed slightly. "I can imagine the two sisters being very angry at each other, and I've come to learn that sometimes, violence is a necessary response to anger like that, but I am glad it doesn't have to end with someone's demise. Or worse." He shrugged a bit.

K: "Yeah." I nodded. "Coz, make sure Vigiliance, Firecracker, Spitfire, and Blaze police up the enemy weapons."

Soarin was more or less permanently grounded until he could overcome both his wing injury, and his own grief. Blaze had taken his place as second-in-command of the Wonderbolts team, which, as I had mentioned some time back, were more or less the Air Force's problem solvers, and elite pilots.

Soarin was.. I didn't know. He might be out of the war. The wing injury was something that needed physical therapy, but he had to WANT to do it. He could still fly an aircraft, but his despondent state had him grounded for psychological reasons, on Belinda's insistence.

Blaze had been at First Ponyville, and since then, had racked up something of a record - being originally third in command of the unit, she had gone to each major Air Force base as they were being constructed, to personally report on their progress. Along the way, she'd refined and written a lot of Air Force doctrine, but hadn't had any combat since her first battle. She and Spitfire were my replacements for Fluttershy and Dash.

We cleaned up the battle area, and on-boarded the Prench Legion. Besides La Selle, Gorton, Gasconade, La Boche, and Zorola, we had Sgt. Le Touf, Zedarcin (who'd been wounded), Ramastes (also wounded), Georges Andre (who became the team Medic), Gelkam, and Nonali Hesput. They added one other - a Griffon named Gelmark, Gelkam's cousin.

I had with me Norfy, Cosmic, Gaze, Dusty, Doc Allcome, Sweetheart, Teddy, Lyra, Bon-Bon, Kiwi, Radio Active, Vigilance, Firecracker Burst, Spitfire, Blaze, Katrina, Twilight, Spike, Webley, Coco, Gorcat, Flash, Blinda, and Babs.

That gave me over half a company of elite special operators. And we were due to meet Havoc's Rangers later on today, too. We would be a potent ground force on that alone, but my train came equipped with goodies, now. Mortars, Funstons, several Brownings in HMG mounts, armored spall plating, the works. It was a command platform on rails. I also had aboard one of Bright Eyes' inventions - three "float packs." Neutral bouyancy balloons with the ability to hold up to 300lbs - enough for a human or two ponies.

The eight POW's would be secured in the Jail Car. Yes, I had one. I did say my personal train was fully equipped, now.



TIME: 11:22 Quirtbeck Eastern Standard Time
LOCATION: Quirtbeck Countryside

The train tooted twice to signal we'd found our allies, and started slowing down. I was already on deck, with some things I was going to bring out of the train, so we could have lunch outside. Corazi was next to me, now wearing a rankless Equestrian Army tunic and Class-B cargo pants (solid Olive Drab). Dusty was right next to her, making sure she understood that she was being watched.

As the train came to a stop, I got out, and was greeted by Havoc's team.

Havoc: "Didja miss me, buddy?" He was practically prancing.

Bella: "It's good to see you, K." She paced up and gave me a hug, nodding to Dusty. "I see you've been sent out with a chaperone."

K: "I get in trouble." I shrugged. "This is Corazi - she's a former Merc, she's changed to our team."

Havoc stepped up to her, all serious, and gave her a sniffle.

Corazi: "Ah-ha-ha.. Careful, Canine, as I am not for feeding. Instead, I have offered myself for leading." She switched to a rhyme tone, and an inflection like Zecora's.. was it a stress response for her?

Havoc: "She smells okay, K." He stepped back over. "Lunch?"

Cosmic: "Sure is." He nodded, bringing out the rest of the vittles. "Just to be on the safe side, K made sure we had almost two months' rations on the train."

K: "HEY! You never know!" I pointed as everyone got off the train.

Havoc: "Where's Sacquet?" He looked at Julienne.

La Selle: "Being a General." She shrugged. "Overseeing zee training and equippage of la Legion."

K: "Speaking of which, I want a circle of fire ready for this area - we were attacked once, I don't want to be caught in an ambush while eating." I pointed, and grabbed a shovel from one of the storage bins on the side of the train.

Corazi grabbed one as well.. and so did Dusty.

I noted Dusty was playing things close.. and as sexist as this may sound, I had a feeling her genuine female intuition was at play, here. Dusty was part of the Paddock, as it were.. probably #3 in my little "I didn't want this, but I have it" Harem. I think.. she saw something in Corazi that I was oblivious to, at this point.

Part 4: Post of Regrets

TIME: 12:44 QEST
DATE: War Day 857/11 Octavius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: La Salle County, Region Nord, Republique du Quirtbeck


We reached the railhead. A new fort had been constructed here, instead of 70km north in the wilderness. Us.. uh.. demolishing the fort with explosives probably had something to do with their decision to move it in the first place.

La Selle and Dusty got off the train with me, and we marched to the Fort's Command HQ. Seated at the desk.. was an old (NOT) friend.

Captain-Major Deux-Ponts: "AH!" He was startled, seeing us all.

K: "Ahhh.. Mister Deux-Ponts." I addressed him without rank - insult.

Deux-Ponts: "M-Marechal K." He snapped to attention. "Colonel La Selle!" And looked at Dusty. "Ehh.. Gendarmes Watch Sergeant.."

Dusty: "Dusty Dunes, Captain-Major." She cocked a brow, and slid a foreleg around me as if to say 'also, the General's woman, show respect.'

K: "Mm.. a much more fitting rank and position, Deux-Ponts." I refrained from saluting back.. just a bit longer.. then snapped him a casual one.

La Selle: "Oui." She SNEERED at him, and brusquely saluted back. "We come on orders of La Princesse Escargot." She handed him a folder. "Effectively, your command is mine."

Deux-Ponts: "Ah.. oui.." He glanced at the orders, and put them on the desk. "What.. ah.. how may we assist you?"

K: "A spot of lunch for us, for starters. One Company's worth. No wine." I cocked a brow. "From the officer's mess."

Deux-Ponts: "Oui, Marechal." He motioned quickly, and motioned for his sassistant.. former General de Brigade, now Lieutenant, Petalin.

Petalin: "Marechal.." He cleared his throat. "..I see miss Rarity is not with you.."

Teddy: "No, Lieutenant, I am." He was in the doorway. "I'm a better shot, too." He GLARED at him.

Petalin: "Ahh." He would have gone pale, if he wasn't already white.

K: "I told you I'd line you up against a wall, Deux-Ponts. I shot off your epaulettes instead of your heads." I leaned in. "I suppose you've heard what happend in Cloudsdale and Ponyville?"

Deux-Ponts: "O-Oui!" He stiffened up. "We may have.. ehh.. you hate me, and for good reason.. I can accept zis. But, zat tragedy should overshadow any personal issue, oui-non?" His tone went from fear.. to genuine regret.

I patted him on the shoulder, and nodded.

K: "Juli?" I looked at her.

La Selle: "I can forgive as well, mon ami." She nodded slightly. "You seem to have changed in zee last year. I note a lack of a belly.. have, perhaps, you learned oncemore what field command means?"

Petalin: "....oui, Madame." He lowered his head as well.

K: "Glad we're on the same page. Now, then. There's a cave about forty or so kilometers north of here. The corduroy road we constructed last year? Have you been maintaining it?" I pointed to the map.

Deux-Ponts: "Oui!" He puffed up, this time, proud of himself. "Petalin and myself were Engineers before we became Cavalry officers, und later Generals.." He shrugged at that, but continued. "We have improved it, it now is fitted stone. Ze former fort was partly reconstructed, and now is zee tradingspost with Canida."

K: "I knew we were close to the Canidan border somehow." I shrugged. "Trappers and gold panners, I'm guessing?"

Petalin: "Oui, Marechal." He nodded.

K: "Alright. After lunch, we'll head out. I have most of everything I need in my train." I shrugged, open palmed.

Spitfire came in at this point.

Somewhat surprisingly, both Deux-Ponts and Petalin stood and bowed respectfully to her.

Deux-Ponts: "Major Spitfire.." He said in reserved tones. "..you were ..are ..one of the leaders of Equestria's Pegasi community. I wish to express my deepest sympathies for your loss."

Spitfire: "..ah." She nodded to them both. "T-Thank you." She was a bit put off by this.

For Spitfire, being seen as a cheerful influencer and leader of the Wonderbolts was one thing. A fair weather social leader. Now that Cloudsdale was destroyed, she increasingly found herself the focus of attention. Having been so famous, it was only natural.

She was taking it well enough. What really bothered me - and something I hadn't addressed directly - was, who was going to take over the Air Force, now? I hadn't mentioned it at this point (since it hadn't been an issue), but Air Chief Marshal Aero Dart was one of the fatalities in Cloudsdale. There was a growing sentiment that Spitfire should be given the job.

Spitfire: "General, the equipment has been unpacked." She nodded to me.

Petalin: "Let me escort you all to zee Officer's Mess, oui?" He escorted my team out.

I looked at Deux-Ponts.

K: "You've grown to know humility." I nodded. "Dead men can't learn." I shrugged.

Deux-Ponts: "Iz zat why you spared my life?" He was serious.

K: "One of the reasons." I looked down at him. "When we get to the point of invading Tirek's homelands, Prance is going to need officers. Good officers. You'll get your chance again - on the field of battle." A nod, and I left.

The Officer's Mess was very nice for a frontier post. I noted that the staff here were Quebecois Militia, simply with Prench commanders. They seemed in decent spirits, in as far as I couldn't see any discontent. I dismissed the serving staff once the food was brought out - we were just here for lunch, no need to roll out the full red carpet.

Senior Sgt. O'Fang: "Ooo.. some nice vittles we gots here." He grinned widely.

K: "Prench food is amazing, O'Fang." I nodded.

Havoc: "Smells amazing." He grinned as we dished ourselves up.

Cosmic: "I made sure the prisoners were fed, K." He nodded as he grabbed his own plate.

Norfy: "I must try this pheasant." He eyed it, and looked to me. "I presume you've had this before, K?"

K: "Not until I got here, actually! I've had Cornish Game Hen, though." I shrugged slightly, and grabbed a slice of.. whatever pig-like creature that meat used to be.

Gaze: "Ehh. Ah needs th' protein, these days." He nabbed some as well.

Lyra: "No kiddin' there, Tiger." She trilled a bit, as Gaze went beet red - PROTEIN INDEED!

Everyone had a giggle at that.

K: "Let's try to enjoy lunch, eh?" I said, grabbing any old seat - Dusty made a show of sitting at my right side.

Corazi sat across from me.

I didn't get it, but this drew stares from Zorola and Zedarcin. Spitfire sat to my left, boxing me in. SHE did it out of close friendship and loyalty.

Spitfire: "..they do serve good food, here." She munched a salad.

La Selle: "Oui. In Prance, as we say, ze army fights on its stomach." She gave a small nod.

Zorola sat next to her sister, and was giving her the eye. I didn't get it - Zebra customs, I supposed. Dusty was guarding the paddock gates, as it were.. and I was kinda glad for it. Her reaction to Corazi was enough to give me the idea that I needed to be careful.

Kiwi: "I'm glad you let us come with, K." She sat on the other side of Corazi. "It's nice to get out.." She smiled a little. "..even if it's a combat mission, as long as we're with friends, everything'll be okay."

Blinda: "That reminds me, Kiwi." She pulled a small case from her tunic pocket, and slid it across the table to her - she'd sat next to Dusty.

Kiwi opened it, and inside were Warrant Officer (Marine Gunner) stars.

K: "Blinda asked me to make you her Staff Warrant Officer. Congratulations, you're part of the command staff for the 1st Marine Division." I nodded to her.

Kiwi: "OH! I accept, ma'am." She giggled, and beamed as Cosmic put them on her.

Blinda: "You came back from something no Pegasus should ever endure, and you've willingly put yourself in greater danger. I can't overlook that." She shook her head.

K: "Everyone's kinda dealing with people moving up and along the chain of command. I mean, at the start of the war, there wasn't really any divisional staff or anything other than the girls.. then again, we didn't have divisions, we had units that just understood the basic idea of working together." I shrugged, eating some of the pork-like stuff.

La Selle: "Oui. Phillipe wanted to be here, but could not." She shrugged. "I suppose, I shall be next, oui?" She looked to Gorton.

Gorton: "Ohhh, no! I don't want this outfit! I'm not even Prench!" He gently waved his claws in defense.

La Selle: "Nonsense. You care. And you are good. That is what matters, Gorton. You are a friend, and a skilled leader." She pat his claw in her hoof.

It was interesting to see. A Griffon reassured by a Pony that everything was going to be okay.

It was good to have such good friends.


TIME: 13:27 QEST


I was in my quarters, preparing everything I'd think I'd need for.. oh.. the tenth time or so. Dusty was with me.. and she was being defensive.

K: "Dusty, you're acting like Corazi wants my dick." I pet her mane, a little. "To be honest, the jealousy is kinda turning me on." I smirked.

Dusty: "Gendarmes to the last, K." She thumped my thigh with the side of her head.. a move more lusty than affectionate, but somewhere in between.

K: "You didn't answer me. That's just a slogan." I nodded, slipping an extra brace of five Degar magazines into my backpack.

Dusty: "I don't know Zebra mating traditions, but she's sure acting like a mare that wants dick." She shrugged.

Corazi came in at that point.. and set her saddlebag down.

Corazi: "That's because I do." She was plain about it.

K: "Ohhhh..! FOR-" I turned around, and expected to see a predatory lusty mare.

I saw a submissive, almost cowering one, with her flanks almost presened.

K: "Ehh." *Sigh* I pinched my fingers to my nose bridge.

Dusty: "Seriously, sister, he's off the market." She shrugged. "Besides, wasn't the original threat to make you OUT to be a Mate Poacher?!" She didn't leave my side.

Corazi: "There's a diff between Mate Poachin' an' expectin' yer new Alpha to take his turn." She squirmed a little.

Zorola came to the rescue at this point, entering, and setting her AA.1 on the seat by my bed.

Zorola: "Fughettaboutit. He ain't gonna." She paced over to her sister, then looked at me. "She's been tryn'a tell'ya she's willin' fer the last couple days. Sittin' across from ya at lunch? Pft." She nodded. "Be like a Pony rubbin' her flanks on yer face." She nodded to Dusty. "No smoke, sistah."

Dusty: "None." She nodded back.

K: "Seriously?!" I threw my hands up, and let them come down. "Are all the Herd-oriented species on the planet like this with Alpha Ma-" All three of them were looking at me like I was stupid. "-aahh've course you are!" I pointed at Corazi. "No. Bad Zebra. No monkey dick."

Corazi curled into an almost defensive posture, and hugged her tail.

Corazi: "I git it.. I ain't good 'nuff yet." She looked away from me.

K: "My wife, Applejack. Princess Luna. Dusty. Princess Celestia. Rarity. Fluttershy. I get those on the regular. Toola Roola? Open doors. Katrina!" I gestured at her. "That's not including Sunset Shimmer." I wagged a finger. "Did HER as a human!" A nod. "And I could easily get a dragon, too, her name's Opalfire, and she totally digs the idea of being in a threeway with me and Luna." I gestured with both open hands. "I.. have.. access to the absolute most primo pussy on the planet! It's not that you're not good enough, my PLATE is FULL!" I slid over to her, and pet her semi-mohawk mane. "I actually think you're attractive, and sassy, and I like that.. but.." I shook my head. "..I have so many I've been shagging or have shagged, or would willingly come back for more.." I patted the uninjured side of her face. "..I can't. And more than that, I'd be taking advantage of an expected cultural thing that, to me, is barely below the Rape needle. I won't do that." I slowly shook my head.

She hugged me, but it wasn't a lewd hug at all. She also started crying. I just.. lost all strength, and let her cry on my shoulder. Both Zorola and Dusty helped comfort her. I didn't know what emotional wounds she was letting out, and letting heal, but I let her do it.

After all, she was my friend, now. If I could help her, I would. She would know the magic of friendship, that didn't involve being taken advantage of.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Mystery Trail

TIME: 17:22 QEST
DATE: War Day 859/13 Octavius 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: La Salle County, Region Nord, Republique du Quirtbeck


We made faster time to the cave than we had before - we weren't keeping pace with a horse-drawn artillery train. When we arrived, I already knew there'd be trouble. Over a hundred meters away, and Teddy and some of the Canidan Rangers spotted lookouts, each taken down in total silence.

We were now moving in squad clusters, broken up, following Robert Rogers' Rules for Ranging - don't line up so one bullet can pass through two soldiers. My squad was Dusty, Webley, Coco, Twilight, Spike, and Teddy. We were on point, too.

K: "Okay.. we're close. Everyone.." I motioned for them all to scatter into the bushes.

We were going to carefully ring the place. Something was up, here, and we needed to know what - Corazi's team hadn't been told squat, other than to stop us. Once we were a bit closer, we could see the cave was guarded well. Two out front with assault rifles, two above the cave's mouth with sub-guns, one with a very SVK-like scoped rifle on a rock outcropping.

I looked over to Havoc's team and gave him the nod.

The Canidan Rangers melted into the tall grass and bushes like butter into popcorn.

There was a low growl off to the left.

Gizmonk Guard: "What the hell was that?!" He shifted his aim over. "You see anything from up there?!" He looked to the Sniper...

...who was missing, having been dragged into the bushes already, his throat in Lt. Barker's strong jaws, crushed.

Gizmonk Guard #2: "The hell happened to him!? He was just there..!" He paced away from the entrance, and turned to face it..

..he was alone, now.

There was more growling. From all around him. Deep, hunting, hungry growls of angry wolves.

Then, there was me. Behind him. OSS Knife poked to his monkey testicles, arm across his chest.

K: "Breathe wrong, and become she." Was all I whispered into his ear. "Drop the gun, relax your body completely."

He did as I asked, and I pulled him back into the bushes with me. Dusty got a blindfold over him, and I tied his wrists and ankles. Coco gagged him.

He could, however, hear the other four being dragged nearby.. and the wolves FEEDING on them.. crunching bones, tearing flesh, one of them gently gasping for air.. a tiny whine as his guts were pulled out.. his most tender bits CRONCHED and torn off..

My prisoner proceeded to lose control of his waste functions.

K: "My name is General K." I sat very close to him, my voice like a somber melody. "I'm going to ask you questions. You're going to be truthful and complete with your answers. Nod if you agree to this."

He did.

I gently stroked the back of his head and united the gag, slipping it out of his mouth, and rolling him over. We'd stripped him of everything but his clothes. Which were now soaked and filled with his waste.

Gizmonk #2: "P-P-Please.." He whinged.. silently.. pleadingly.

K: "Name." I started with that.

Gretchim: "G-G-Gretchim.. I go by Chi." He was quivering in absolute terror.

Corazi moved up at this point and sat obediently next to me, keeping her head low in reverence to my Alpha Status.

K: "Good Girl." I stroked her mane like an obedient pet, and she nuzzled submissively into it. "Objective?"

Gretchim: "G-Guard.. the entrance.. there's a team inside. S-Sultan's personal guards, and some Magi I've never seen b-b-before." He had tears coming from his eyes.

K: "Number." I said in a flat tone, gently caressing my knuckle over the injured part of Corazi's face, showing it off like a trophy.

Gretchim: "A-About.. thirty.. or so. Uh.. An extraction team'll be here in.. about an hour or so. T-Trucks.. couple dozen troops.." He flicked his eyes at Corazi. "I-I thought.. you were.. on the other team..?"

Corazi: "..I been 'claimed' ... by th' Human." She refused to look him in the eyes.. her face showed submission and shame.

K: "Silence." I was gentle with that.

Corazi: "Yes.. massah.." She cowed a bit from my hand.

Gretchim: "G-G-God.." He sobbed a little.

K: "You want in The Treasury?" I leaned in to him a little bit. "Or do you want in the gutter?" I teased him with his religion. "How did you all get here?"

Gretchim: "T-T-Tirek.. sss.. ome kinda.. portal.." He was full on crying softly, now. "You humans are sick!"

K: "Be glad this is all I plan to do." I nodded slowly to him. "One of your kinfolk negotiated the survival of your species. I have Herdiet Atomic Weapons, and something far greater than them.. I had planned to genocide your race, but I was convinced otherwise." I looked up at Dusty. "Gag him, drag him back to the road, and leave him tied up good. Use chains. These monkeys are very dexterious."

Dusty did as ordered.. and after she was well out of earshot, Corazi rolled over and started laughing her striped ass off. Everyone did.

K: "Okay, Corazi, that was amazing acting!" I gave her a half-hug.

Corazi: "Ehhh... I got da chops!" She giggled, and gently tapped her hooves.

Coco: "Heck, even I was convinced K had had his way with you, and turned you into his slave." She wiggled her eyebrows.

K: "Yeah, yeah, I get it - there's more than a few mares, and even a couple stallions that would probably enjoy that." I pat her helmet. "Settle down." I nodded to the cave. "We'll wait for them to exit. Let them do the work for us."

Havoc: "We're sure they're going to take it and not destroy it?" He nodded to me.

K: "An extraction team of appreciable size means they want it for themselves and need a guard. If they just wanted it destroyed, why send VIPs?" I pointed to Twilight and Vigilance. "Get the machine guns set up."

Gorcat: "I'll take the left with the Prench." He nodded, and moved over by them.

We had the entrance covered. Havoc and his team would take the road and intercept the enemy reinforcement convoy if they got here first.

I was behind a rock with Dusty and Corazi, who I trusted with a Ridgway. Babs was right next to us, and staring lasers at the entrance.

One of the enemy from inside the cave - a Camel - came out, and pulled a manufactured cigarette from a small case, and lit it. Then, looked around and realized no one was there. Upset, the camel moved around a bit, and stopped a bit shy of the bush that La Selle was behind.

He looked down and saw her F1 rifle aimed at his face.

But, it didn't matter, as La Boche got behind him and stabbed him in the side of the neck, punching out, making a mess, and dragging him into the bushes.

The Camel, I noted, was in uniform. Interesting.

I checked him quickly.. he seemed to be some kind of officer, and seemed to be Army, if I was to guess.

I could hear the enemy party starting to come towards the cave entrance. They were in good spirits, I could hear them chattering in their language, and it seemed to be in positive tones.

Ten of them emerged from the cave mouth, with several more behind them. Most were dressed in semi-formal uniforms, and had pistols on their belts. One of them had a lot of brass on his shoulders..

K: "I WANT THE GENERAL! OPEN FIRE!!"

One very brief burst of automatic gunfire, and the rest of them were dead, with not a single one able to clear leather. The General cowered at the sound of gunfire, but when he found himself alone, he desperately tried to get his pistol out, not looking at us. When he looked up, myself, Gorton, and Gorcat were in his face.

I just twisted the handgun out of his grasp, and stuck it in my belt.

He drew his sword.

I grabbed his wrist, twisted it, pressed my thumb into the wrist nerve, made him drop it, picked it up in my other hand, and crossed my arms, letting him go.

He blinked.. and had no idea how to respond at first.. then just held his forelegs out and bowed his head.

K: "Do you speak Equestrian?" I asked.

He looked at me funny.

Gorton: "Parles-tu Prançais?" He asked without accent.

He nodded slowly to Gorton.

K: "At least we can communicate." I nodded. "Bring him."

I motioned for everyone else to be on guard, and we brought the enemy commander back to the road area, where Chi was still tied up. He looked at Chi, and shook his head, angry at him.

Gorton: "Ne lui en voulez pas. Il est un idiot." He shrugged.

K: "Name, rank, serial number." I nodded to Gorton.

Gorton: "Quel est votre nom et votre grade militaire?" He nodded to him.

General: "Fasad. Général Fasad." His accent was strong.. strongly Arabian.

Gorton: "Combien y en a-t-il d’autres dans la grotte?" Asked Gorton, regarding the remaining enemy troops in the cave.

Fasad: "Douze soldats, trois archéologues." He shrugged.

Gorton: "He says a dozen troops, three eggheads - archaeologists." He gestured towards the cave.

K: "Good enough." I stood up. "Let's go surprise them."

And get the Weather Rock, hopefully without much more inconvenience.
