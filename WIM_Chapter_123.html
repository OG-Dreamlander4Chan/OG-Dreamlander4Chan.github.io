Part 1: Ponyville Neighbors

TIME: 09:41 ERDT
DATE: War Day 951/15 Solarus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: #22 Baskerville Place, Ponyville, Erie, Equestria

I was at Broken's new house. As a temporary measure, since Canterlot was a short train ride away, I had quarters prepared for everyone.

Out front, I was greeted by Magellan.

K: "Well, hello, there, Magellan!" I held out my hand, and he flew over and sat on it.

Magellan: *CHIRP!* He struck a pose.

K: "Want some seeds? Oh, I know. How about.." I dug in my coat, and came up with a small bacon bit.

Magpies are omnivores. He took the treat, and scarfed it down.

K: "Broken? You in there, buddy?" I said, pacing to the door.

Magellan: *Pir-CHEEP!*

Broken: "OH! Oh, K!" He nodded. "Aye, that's where ya flew off to." He stuck out a wing, and Magellan flew over to it.

K: "Thought I'd come see how you're settling in." I nodded.

Broken: "Quite well!" He beamed a grin. "His Royal Highness seems t'have slipped a coupl'a books into my collection." He nodded to the book case that was built into the wall.

K: "Mmm. Blueblood's good like that." I nodded "Have you heard the story of Chowsin Ridge?"

Broken: "Nae.." He blinked. "'Spect you'll tell me, tho."

K: "Mmmhmm." I nodded. "It was a very bloody fight. Most of 15th company was lost in the battle. Their commander is now senior officer of the Army. It was when we discovered someone had been stealing my designs, and reworking them. The Khyangese had tanks, too. Well, halfway through the battle, Blueblood comes charging in wearing a full length cloak. He'd been missing since the start of the war. I left him in a puddle of his own piss in the castle. Anyway, Blueblood comes charging in there with a Sagebrush, and starts dominating the battlefield. He saved Rainbow Dash's life, destroyed the 2nd tank, saved me at one point, and.. really, if it wasn't for him, I'd be dead, and the war would've been over." I shook my head.

I sat and explained the Battle of Paradise Estates to him. Abotu midway through, Golden paced in, and just sat and listened. Dusk arrived (on his own, for once) about three quarters of the way through.

K: "..and in the end, we technically won that battle, as we had troops still alive. The Khyangese did not. But, on paper, it was a 100 to 100 double-KO on casualties." I shrugged.

Dusk: "I lost some friends there. One of them was a former Royal Guard, like me. Sergeant Grape Shinelight." He nodded to me.

K: "Oh, yeah.." I nodded. "..he was wounded early off and executed by the Khyangese when they overran the medical area."

Dusk: "You really DO remember all of us, huh?" He said with a bit of admiration.

K: "Every one." I lowered my head a bit. "I know I can't save them all, but I work my hardest to save the ones I can. It.. drags on you, after a bit."

Dusk: "That's actually why I'm here." He looked at Golden and Broken. "Well, youngbloods? How're you dealing?"

Golden: "..be lyin' if I said I weren't scared back there." He shook his head.

Broken: "Terrified. But.. my training took over, and.. I just did." He shrugged. "Looking back, I'm.." He glanced off to the side. "..I promised the Kirin that I'd keep their fire of courage in my belly."

Dusk: "I know better than anyone else what battle can do." He touched his scar. "Maybe. I think Forest Spirit is pretty close behind, but he's had less time to deal with it." He looked at me. "You mentioned when we were on the Cloudsdale that Dr. Turner was on staff for us for this sort of thing." He nodded. "Everypony should be.. encouraged.. to go see her. Especially after the big fights. Some of us can deal with it, some of us can't."

K: "Yeah." I nodded, grimacing a bit. "I'm not a paragon of virtue when it comes to a clean bill of mental health myself."

Forest Spirit: "Speaking of." He paced in with Redheart, both of them in only a shirt. "Dusk, I've been hearing how you handled that battle with K down. I agree with him, and so does Ironhide. You're Senior, now." He pulled a box from his shirt pocket and handed it to me.

K: "Dusk Seeker, you committed yourself singly to victory in the Kirin village, against impossible odds, and kept the formation together. For that and other exemplary displays of command and soldiery, I promote you to Senior Altern." I pinned the new silver stars on his collar - he was now equal to an Army Major, but had precedence over all Majors in the regular army.

Dusk: "Ah. Eh. Thank you, sir." He nodded. "K." And shrugged. "Just.. ah.. doing my job?"

Redheart: "My husband was the SAME WAY until K made him Commandant." She gave Dusk a one-leg hug. "Humble to the end." And smiled.

Broken: "....COMMANDANT!" He suddenly said, and bowed to him. "Your Lordship!"

Forest Spirit: "...OH, BUCK! Here we go. Here. We. Go. Get up, Cornet. Get up." He gestured to him with his foreleg.

Redheart: *Giggle!* "What's all this, hun?"

Forest Spirit: "He.. he recognizes me as the Prince of Ironland." And frowned.

All others: "WHAT?!"

Forest Spirit: *GROANS!* "Remember when I said my family was royalty? Well.. my great grandfather was Phaedrig the 11th." He grimaced. "The Last Prince of Ironland."

K: "Oh, my GOD.. no WONDER Rodney wanted a piece!" I spat out.

Golden: "Rodney, K?" He tilted his head.

K: "The Viscount Rodney. Formerly. He was the original commander of Blue Squadron, but he tried to take a chunk out of me, and both Forest Spirit and Blinda.. decked him for it." I cleard my throat a bit. "He probably recognized you, too."

Forest Spirit: "I'm certain he did." He frowned. "I think the other Ambleonian Royals and senior officers ALL know." And shook his head. "I think the only reason they don't object to me.. is you, K."

K: "I raised you through the ranks, you mean?" I cocked a brow.

Forest Spirit: "No, no.. you're controlling me. I'm on YOUR leash. They think." He smirked a bit, and scooted close up to Redheart.

K: "You're not and you know it." I nodded. "You're basically second in command of the Equestrian Military, after me."

Forest Spirit: "Something I've had to do several times." He shrugged, dismissively. "You trained me good for it."

K: "I did. Now.. doesn't that actually make your father the presumptive Crown Prince?" I nodded to him.

Forest Spirit: "Yes, and both my brother River and I would be Prince Dauphin. Since he never designated a specific heir, you'd go by who had superior substantive rank. And that's me. Plus, the grant of 20 acres of land outside of Ponyville from the Princess for my billet as Marine Commandant? Yeah, I'm literally Landed Gentry." He shrugged.

K: "Making you Dauphin-Presumptive." I nodded.

Forest Spirit: "Exactly." He shrugged.

Broken: "But.. you.." He squinted at me, then looked at Forest Spirit.

Forest Spirit: "I don't want the throne." He was very direct. "I'm Equestrian. I'm Texan. I'm only Prince because of my bloodline, not by what I feel I am." He nodded firmly, and pawed the ground. "I appreciate the respect, Broken, but don't address me as anything but Forest. That's who I am. Not a Prince."

Broken: "Fascinating." He blinked.

Magellan: *Chirp-a-chirpaning!* He mimic'd.

Dusk: "I had a feeling that was what it was." He nodded a bit. "I do know the Royal Houses. It's part of our Guard Training, so we know who to pay proper respects to."

Golden: "Fine wi' me." He nodded.

Forest Spirit: "That reminds me - the wifey and I brought House Warming gifts." He said, handing over a small package to both Broken and Golden.

Inside were two carved wooden plaques - Golden's was shaped like a flower, and Broken's was a small sunrise with birds. "THIS STABLE HOME." Was burned into each, along with a Celtic knot that was "tied" around a horseshoe.

I surmised it was something cultural that I wouldn't quite get.

Broken: "These are LOVELY, Forest!" He beamed, and Magellan helped him hang it, both taking wing slightly and affixing it to an existing nail on a cross beam over the main room.

Golden: "Aye, mate! Can't wait to hang mine!" He beamed.

K: "Well, then.. why don't you let the Boss take you all out to lunch in Canterlot today? There's a great cafe that I've been meaning to eat at again." I shrugged. "Plus, I promised AJ."

Golden: "Sure!" He tapped Broken. "How 'bout it?"

Broken: "Sure thing, K!" He nodded with a grin.

Dusk: "Sounds great." He smirked. "I'll go get Rarity and we'll meet you at the Train Station. We can make the 10:15." He nodded.

With that, we broke up the group to go get other people.

I didn't realize this would turn into a party. All the other girls showed up, as did Wallflower, Rapid, Blizz and Olivine. Cosmic, Gaze, Norfy, Lyra, Kiwi, and Bon-Bon joined us as well.

We stuffed ourselves into the train and took the 45-minute ride to Canterlot. While service had mostly been restored, there was still a cut-off for trains coming from the East. Next week, Ponyville would take its place as a train hub between Canterlot, Baleston, and Manehattan.

What surprised me was, when we arrived at the Cafe, there were a lot of senior guards there, along with Cadence, Sunshine Smiles, Gorcat, Greta, and their entourages.

K: "Ohhh.. what's all THIS, then?!" I smiled at them all.

Luna: "I am having a late dinner, then.. bed.. my General." She slipped out from the crowd - I should note, she's wearing a light gown, in white. It contrasted nicely with her colors.

Applejack: "Boy howdy!" She smiled. "Wantin' ta borrow 'im fer a lil' strategy session?" She wolfishly grinned.

Luna: "Oh.. perhaps." She flicked her tail at me.

Several of the guards, Gorcat, and Sunshine gave little hoots of bro-ly approval.

Sunshine: "That's our K." He nodded, looking to Steela and the other new girls. "Nice to meet you - Sunshine." He stuck out his hoof.

Steela: "Is pleasure. Steela Oresdottir. K's bodyguard." She blushed a bit.

Applejack: "He has." She shrugged. "My orders." And smirked.

Cadence: "Well, you're just in time." She nodded, beckoning us all closer. "We named her Aurora Amore Cadenza-Smiles."

A BABY FOAL! OH MY GAWD! I went to pieces immediately.

K: "Hey, there!" I was on my knees, almost under her, nuzzling my human nose to her tiny face.

Applejack: "Aw!! She's precious!" She beamed.

Cadence: "She's a week old." She nodded to Twilight. "Come here! I want you all to be her uncles and aunts."

She 'bit' my nose - and suckled on it. Or tried to, until she realized it was just a nose. She then yawned in my face.

K: "Yeah, hi. I'm Uncle K." I was tearing up.

I slid back to let the others in on the action, and patted Sunshine on the shoulder.

Sunshine: "Long way from Gloom Mountain, huh?" He nodded.

K: "Sure are." I smiled. "Great job."

Gorcat: "That's nothing!" He puffed himself up. "Greta?"

Greta: "This mother-fluffer hit me with a whole clutch!" She needled him in the side, but pat her belly. "Really, K, thank you." She nodded, and blushed.

Broken: "There's so many..!" He blinked, and Magellan copied him.

K: "Yeah, I've.. made some good friends." I shrugged. "Gorcat, here, was at my side constantly until he became King of the Griffons. Sunshine was a Lunar Guard until Shining Armor was killed, and he became Prince-Consort to Cadence." I sighed, wistfully. "This war, like any war, has done good and bad in many lives."

Broken: "I suppose it has." He tilted his head, and Magellan did likewise.

K: "Hey, the best we can do is make sure the misfortune of the war is minimized, and we come out of this with as few hurt friends as we can." I patted his shoulder, seeing Forest Spirit heft the royal baby. "You, Golden, Dusk, Forest Spirit, Redheart - you'll be the ones making darn sure. I'll be there to help."

Broken: "I suppose so, K." He nodded, and smiled a bit. "One.. question. How.. how bad are things in your world, that you're so worried about ours?"

K: "A good one." I nodded. "Come on, gets get seated and order food. I'll explain." I gestured to the cafe, which was setting out more tables and chairs to accomodate us.

So, now.. Cadence had a baby. And I was thinking about the realities of what we were going to face.

Broken was on the money, though - why did this matter as much as it did?

[End of Part 1]

Part 2: Tribulations

TIME: 11:49 ERDT
DATE: War Day 951/15 Solarus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Canterlot City, Canterlot Capital District, Erie, Equestria

I'd sat down with Broken, Dusk, Rarity, AJ and Luna. At the next table was Ironhide, Lute Sunray, Sunshine, and Cadence.

K: "To answer your question, Broken, my world is a lot like this one, except humans. Problem is, you can take the scale of "kindness" and "niceness" and largely invert it - there are lots of good humans, but there's a lot of violence and brutality. There's a lot of war. We humans evolved on war. You evolved on peace. While you see war as a terrible blight, we see peace as a wonderous joy. It's something we don't experience as often as we'd like. There's a lot of 'dark mirror' type stuff going on. It's not 100% - and I'd like to think that humans are still more positive than negative on the whole - but we have dark sides that would depress and cause some to lose all hope or any semblence of mercy." I shrugged. "That's why this place is so precious to me-"

Fluttershy: "It's the opposite - instead of darkness so scary you're afraid you'll never come out of it, we have brightness so sunny, you can't imagine ever feeling bad ever again!" She said, with a bright, smiling grin.

K: "She's.. that's pretty accurate." I shrugged. "I hope you get it."

Broken: "In a way, yes." He tapped his pencil to his lip, havign been making some notes. "Do you think anyone out there can see this?"

K: "I hope someone can - and I hope they get a message OF hope when they do. Not that ponies can be stirred to violence, but that they ARE willing to do ANYthing they must, to protect this wonderful world and those within it, no matter how impossible-seeming the odds might be." I gestured with one hand as our drinks arrived - coffee, for me. "That despite that bright and friendly nature, you absolutely will not be taken advantage of, hurt, or enslaved. That you'll stand up. And you have the strength of both character, and body, to make that stick. It might sound silly.."

Dusk: "Not at all." He nodded. "I was thinking something similar when we started training with firearms. That, finally, we had some advantage that would make sure EVERY pony could finally make a stand, if they had to. Something that made us all stronger, more capable." He nodded to me.

K: "Tell me about it." I nodded to him, sipping my coffee.

I bade Dusk Seeker to tell me everything about how he got into this, and how he was trained. His interaction with Steelhoof, Ironhide, and the other senior Guard officers.

---Flashback Cut---

21 Septimus, 1001 C.S.
Royal Guard Training Grounds, Canterlot Heights

Captain of the Guard Steelhoof: "I've asked you all here today because.. the human.. K.. he's.. shown me things." He paced over to the training table, and showed off the Sherman rifles and Lee pistols. "These are firearms. They kill."

Ensign of the Guard Ironhide: "We know he was working on some armaments project for Her Highness.." He nodded to them.

Altern Dusk Seeker: "Are these, it?" He looked at the table. "They look less useful than spears."

Chief Altern Lute Sunray: "So, why us?" She shrugged.

Steelhoof: "You six are the best we have." He nodded. "You will go back to your formations and train them."

Senior Altern Reticent Whisper: "I see. So, we're going to teach everyone how to use these things?" She nodded to the weapons.

Steelhoof: "More than that. We have tactics to teach as well. We're going to make the Royal Guards, Equestria's elites. We're the ones that are supposed to be protecting the ponies of the kingdom - and by Celestia's mane, we're going to do it." He nodded to Dusk. "Out of all of us, you have the most field experience. Come here."

Dusk: "Alright." He paced over to the table. "Show me these.. firearms."

Steelhoof picked up the Sherman in front of him.

Steelhoof: "This is the Sherman Rifle. It is accurate out to about 200 meters. It fires an 8g projectile at 570 meters-per-second." He took a magazine off the table. "And if you doubt its effectiveness..." The magazine was loaded into the rifle, the bolt pulled back, and allowed to slam home. He then removed the safety. "Observe."

Steelhoof fired all ten rounds - ten different targets. A watermelon, a cantaloupe, a burst bag of red chalk, a balloon filled with red liquid, a pine board about 20mm thick, a slab of metal about 5mm thick, a standard Guard's breastplate, a 120mm thick multi-layer stack of leather, and finally.. a pig's corpse.

The devastation to each target was measurable. According to Dusk, everyone recoiled, seeing the round pass neatly through the breastplate, especially. That part really stuck with them. That the armor they'd prided themselves on for over a century, was reduced to decorative tinfoil, literally overnight.

Dusk: "...I take it back." He nodded. "Show me how to use the human's invention, sir.." And looked at the rifle carefully. "..this is incredible."

Steelhoof: "Just imagine if you'd had one of these at the Dragon incident." He nodded, smiling.

Dusk: "..yeah." He ran a hooftip over his lip.

Lute Sunray: "Aiye.. with these.. ANY pony would.. could.." She shook her head.

Steelhoof: "Exactly. Any pony at all.. can now defend themselves effectively." He nodded.

Chief Altern Nightlace: "And defend against.. what, exactly?" He shrugged, gesturing with his hoof. "We have the Elements. What could be so bad?"

Steelhoof: "You know, it's.. rather funny you should say that, given your unit, Nightlace. What if we'd not had the Elements when Nightmare Moon returned?" He looked over each of the officers, who all paused, and looked thoughtful.

All but Dusk.

Dusk: "Honestly, sir, we would have been destroyed. Or enslaved. Or whatever her goals were, before being banished, and Princess Luna freed from her thrall." He shook his head. "Really, everyone. Don't be dense. SOMEthing is out there. We don't have to know what it is, to know we have to be ready."

Yes, that was the official story going around at the time - that Nightmare Moon had POSSESSED Luna, and only because Celestia didn't have the power, spell, or ability to separate them, did she banish her to the moon.

And it was laid squarely at the feet (hooves) of Twilight and the Girls - the Elements of Harmony - that they banished Nightmare Moon.

Lute Sunray: "Dusk's right." She nodded. "Alright, sir. Show us."

--Flashback Cut--

Dusk: "It was the same days of intense training that you put HIM through. But, more. He had added things." He shrugged.

K: "That's why dedicating the training grounds to him, is so important to me. That and.. giving his life for Luna." I nodded.

Luna: "Indeed. He impressed me with his great courage." She smiled, wistfully.

Dusk: "I'm sorry I wasn't there when it happened." He shook his head.

K: "Nothing to be sorry for." I patted his shoulder. "It was Steelhoof's call to send certain detachments out to the outer rings of the city to guard against whatever. And after that, you had to protect the Princesses. You did the job you were trained for, as a Guard - evacuate the civilians and the Princesses to safety."

Dusk: "Yeah. And I failed Shining Armor, too." He frowned.

K: "Again, not your fault. We did determine that the Guard were being gently influenced by Chrysalis' magic. And after the Guard was expanded, you were forced into a desk, over at the Old Fort before we constructed Fort Defense." I shook my head. "There's literally nothing more you could have done, until the East Indies came up."

Flash: "I had that problem, too." He shrugged. "It wasn't until after she was killed that my mind was finally clear."

Cadence: "Don't blame yourself, Dusk." She sighed. "I know, silly thing to say."

Sunshine: "No kidding." He nodded. "I was in 4th Platoon with him when he came back. Dusk assigned my squad to Operation: Royal Oak. Only because Ironhide didn't allow him.." He lowered his head. "My Goodness.. Dusk?" He looked up. "You could've been the one at K's side this whole time!"

Dusk: "Orders are orders." He shrugged. "Ironhide didn't want to lose any more officers. We lost several at First Canterlot. He even told me.." He looked at Ironhide.

Ironhide: "I told him that I better not catch him trying to sneak out there. That his platoon hadn't seen combat, yet, and he himself hadn't seen any action since the Dragon Migration." He paused and shook his had. "I didn't want to risk the stallion I thought would be head of Luna's Guard some day soon. Then, when the expansion came, I knew he was the only guard we had that had both the knowledge and the experience to train others. I needed him elsewhere."

K: "And now, he's here." I nodded. "I need him." I looked at Dusk. "Not just the life experience, but the craftiness. What happened with you at 2nd Canterlot?"

Dusk: "HEH!" He smiled just a bit. "Well.."

Lute Sunray: "..hey, Dusk." She paced up to his position, as she prepared to come on duty.

Dusk: "Lute." He nodded to her. "You look concerned.

Lute Sunray: "Aero Dart's got all the flyers going back to Cloudsdale. He says it's an exercise." She shrugged her wings.

Dusk: "..." He blinked and lowered his head. "..of course it is. It's war. We need to expect the unexpected." And he shrugged.

Lute Sunray: "Oh, I guess so, huh." She blinked, and walked over to the desk. "This is your report?"

Dusk: "It is. I don't mind filling in for Mist, you know. 4th Platoon's my unit." He smiled just a little.

Lute Sunray: "Nothing unusual?" She looked up at him.

Dusk: "Not a thing." He nodded. "Well, if you're my Relief, I'm going to head out early."

Lute Sunray: "Sure thing." She smiled brightly. "See you later."

Dusk: "Sure." He nodded.

--Flashback Cut--

Dusk: "I was lying. I knew something was up as soon as she told me Aero Dart had a training mission set up like that. He.. Celestia Rest his Soul.. he wasn't that kind of an officer." He shrugged at me.

Dusk wasn't heading for his post. He knew something was up. He wasn't happy about not being in the loop about this, but he knew.. there was a reason. Instead, he was at 4th and Maine, by one of the other Guard Posts - for 7th Platoon of the regular Royal Guard. Not the palace.

Dusk: "Steeling!" He marched in.

Altern Steeling Fan: "Dusk!? What are YOU doing here? Shouldn't you be at the palace about now?" He paced over with Lance Corporal of the Guard Gilded Shield.

Dusk: "Something's up. Something's BEEN up since this morning! I want everyone fully armed - rifles and field packs. NOW!" He ordered.

Steeling: "Dusk - we're the same rank, you-"

Dusk: "I have seniority as Planning and Training Staff Officer. Now DO it!" He pointed. "And give me a Sherman!"

Gilded: "He means it, sir." He handed over one of the Shermans from the rifle rack, along with a bandolier of magazines.

Steeling: "This is crazy." He paced over to Dusk. "Why do you think you have the authority-"

Then, they all heard the buzzing.. from the center of town. The whole platoon moved out of the Guard House to take a look. There, in the skies.. black figures.

Dusk: "CHANGELINGS!" He shouted.

Steeling: "Yes.." He smirked, stepping back.

Dusk: "St-Steeling?!" He turned, just as Steeling changed back into a Changeling. "FOR LUN-"

Three shots rang out at the same instant - Steeling's Morgan, Dusk's Sherman, and Gilded's Lee, as Gilded shoved Dusk to the ground.

Master Guard Iron Helm: "Altern's dead, sir! Or.. whatever he was!" He came over. "MEDIC! CROSS, GET OVER HERE!"

Dusk: "For the love of the Moon!" He slid Gilded off of him. "GET ARMED! THEY'RE COMING! COME ON!" He ordered, as the Medic came over.

Master Guard Redly Cross: "I'm here! I'm here!" He bent down and checked Gilded. "..oh, fillyflanks."

Dusk: "He's not." He frowned.

Redly: "Sorry, sir." He shrugged.

Adjutant Silver Plate: "Dusk! What.. what do we do!?" She shrugged.

Dusk: "I'm in command here." He stood fully. "Full gear. Come on, we have to defend the town. Squads 1 and 2 work on killing those things. Squads 3 and 4, cover any civilians trying to evacuate. Squad 5, you're in reserve." He nodded. "We're Royal Guards - time to act like it."

--Flashback Cut--

Dusk: "I will admit, reorganizing the Royal Guard that way hadn't made sense until that moment." He shrugged. "Each Guard Platoon being half a normal company instead of a mere 12 ponies. Then four Platoons to a Company." And a nod.

K: "I did that when I reorganized the standard Royal Guard into a full Regiment. Since the Guard are responsible for the entire city and the palace, they have a more defensive nature. Not an offensive one. Offensive forces need to be smaller, so they're more flexible. Twelve Guard Platoons to a Regiment, split into three double-sized Companies. That matched up with the six total Guard Posts in the city and palace, assuming two shifts." I gestured.

--Flashback Cut--

Dusk had all of 4th Street between Maine and Neighbraska evacuated, and all the civilians heading to the edge of the city. He was leading the way, as 1st and 2nd squad fired into the sky.

Major Duncan Deep: "HOLD!"

Rifles.. lots of rifles aimed at them, as they reached the edge of the city, and found the Militia from several places outside, waiting for them. Or.. not THEM.. but.. theeeemmm.

Dusk: "Altern Dusk Seeker - Planning and Training Staff Officer!" He held up his Sherman over his head.

Duncan Deep: "Major Duncan Deep, Baleston Militia. Advance and give the counter-sign! Green-One-Three!"

Dusk lowered his head but a moment, then nodded.

Dusk: "Counter-Sign is White Lilly." He stood at attention.

Duncan Deep: "Confirmed! Come ahead!" He nodded.

Dusk: "Adjutant - get the civlians some water and find them some cover!" He directed, moving over to Duncan. "How bad is it, sir?"

Duncan Deep: "Bad enough. I've 6 ponies wounded so far. Five more with magical injury. I-"

The ground rumbled at that point, and a green haze could be seen coming up from the palace. Almost at the same instant, every single Changeling dropped from the sky, dead.

Dusk: "I do think we've won, Major." He nodded, smirking just a tiny bit.

Duncan Deep: "I think so, Altern." He patted him on the back. "Nice work evacuating the civilians from the line of fire - Ironhide shall hear of this."

Dusk: "It's my job, sir. Our job. As Royal Guards." He stood proudly, as his formation aided the civilians.

--Flashback Cut--

Dusk: "..and that's pretty much it. I was ready to go back in, but.. the battle ended. It wasn't until later that.. I found out.. Shining was.." He frowned.

Twilight: "..don't be mad at yourself, Dusk. You did what you could. And more. You sniffed out something was wrong, and probably saved quite a few lives. My brother would have been proud of you." She slid over, and hugged him. "You're loyal, brave, and caring, Dusk. I'm proud to have you as a friend."

Dusk: "Twilight.." He sighed, and hugged back. "Still, it was on that day that I vowed to find a way back into the war. On the front line. Not cowering in the rear." He shrugged at me. "Took me long enough, but I did."

K: "And we're proud to have you." I nodded back to him.

So, that's how Dusk ended up a minor hero at 2nd Canterlot. Quite the story, and it explained why he had the motivation to get BACK into the action - he knew he could contribute.

I was honored to have such a stalwart friend.

I was in bed with Applejack and Luna. We were.. uh.. 'finished.'

I was smiling, with my arms crossed behind my head, and Applejack sleeping against my right pectoal. Luna was awake and reading to herself.

Luna: "Dozing, My General?" She whispered, leaning over.

K: "Mmm. Fully relaxed, kinda dozing, very comfy." I smiled.

Applejack was dead asleep and lightly snoring.

Luna: "I'm.. so glad we get some time together." She nuzzled my cheek. "Go for a walk?"

K: "Any time." I slid out from under AJ, and got some clothes on.

Luna: "This.. war has taught me many things." She said, as we departed the room. "How to connect with my subjects, what they need, the things that have changed.." She smiled. "..what it means to love again. Not just you, but.." She tilted her head to the side. "..them as well. To truly love and care for them, like a mother might."

K: "You always did care - now you know how to care more closely. Not from a removed ivory tower. Not just worried from the top down, but from the ground up." I nodded to her, and saw Dusk heading into the Guard's Kitchen. "Oh, look who's up." I nodded to him. "Come on."

Luna: "Of course!" She giggled a bit.

We stepped into the kitchen and found him pouring some hot chocolate, with Misty Stars in there.

Misty: "..and then the vampires attacked." She sighed. "OH! Sir!" She nodded to me.

K: "Misty. Dusk." I nodded, as Luna came in behind me.

Misty: "Your Majesty." She bowed.

Dusk: "Princess." He bowed as well.

Luna: "Two of my most loyal, bravest Lunar Guards." She bid them to rise, as she levitated a cup. "Spare a cup of hot chocolate?" And smiled, personably.

Dusk: "Of course!" He stiffened up a bit, as he poured with his own horn telekinesis.

I NOTICED the stiffening.. interesting..

Misty: "It's a pleasure to share a cup with our Moon Princess." She bowed her head just a bit.

K: "Mm." I nodded, and took the coffee pot and a cup, and poured for myself. "After that story, Dusk, you know.. I really recognize how valuable you've been so far. I didn't even know. And you know what?" I pointed my cup at him.

Dusk: "A-ah, yes?" He was a bit dazed, but he looked over at me.

K: "It's good. It's good that you are - it means I don't have to micromanage as much as I'd once thought I did. You're proof positive that this military can stand on its own four hooves." I nodded to him.

Misty: "We try, sir." She nodded.

Dusk: "Thank you, K." He smiled a bit.

I should note that Luna is not only wearing a very pretty flowing white gown/dress thing, but also her royal hoofcaps and breastplate, and crown. The dress looked like spilling moonlight, especially with her astral mane. And yet, she carried herself far less stiffly than she once had. She carried herself more.. like one of them.

And Dusk was.. staring.

K: *Sharp inhale* "So, anyway, Dusk, I'll leave you to get some rest. Luna? Shall we tour the garden?" I smirked at her, casually.

Luna: "Of course, My General." She drank the rest of her cup, set it down, and.. "Thank you, Dusk and Misty." ..nodded to them both as we departed.

I could see, clearly, that Dusk didn't just have a dedication to Luna. He had.. something more. And that gave me.. ideas.

I was going to be a bad general, but probably a best friend. If.. Luna was up for it.

We sat down in the garden at one of the benches.

Luna: "Such a beautiful night." She smiled, and nuzzled me.

K: "..you know how we've been talking about having kids of our own?" I said, pulling her into a hug.

Luna: *Sigh* "..yes." This was.. a sad-love sigh.

K: "I think I've found the stallion for it." I nodded.

Luna: "You'd said you didn't want to have Forest Spirit for everything.." She blinked. "..then, who?"

K: "Dusk." I nodded firmly. "I get around him, I get a LOT of the same feelings I did with Gorcat and Sunshine. Like.. we complete each other in the battlefield sense. We have an understanding of each other's thought processes. And it didn't take long for us to get this way." I looked at her. "Admit it - he's as close to a natural born soldier of every caliber, as Starlight is."

Luna: "From.. what I know, and what I've seen.. yes." She nodded. "I believe I understand, My General." She smiled a bit. "I should like to know him more, myself."

K: "Now I just need to ask HIM." I shrugged. "I'm pretty sure Rarity will be okay with it. Since, this time, she's Number One."

Luna: "Ohh?" She purred at me, almost pushing me down on the bench.. and I let her go all the way with that. "Do you.. enjoy.. your Princess of the Moon being.." She bit her lip. "..submissive a little? Second? Teased?"

K: "Maybe." I smirked back up at her. "Only because I know you have a bit of a newfound fetish for it."

She blushed.

We fucked.

TIME: 08:27 ERDT

Dusk: "YOU WANT ME TO WHAT?!" He dropped his coffee cup on the floor.

Rarity: *Giggle!* "Oh, my! Desiring my stallion, now, K?" She smiled at me. "First it was just m-"

K: "Yes." I cut her off, and nodded to him. "You're the first stallion I thought of, that I thought would be a match. Both in personality, and.." I shrugged. "..trust."

Dusk: "You... you.. I.. uh.. THE PRINCESS.. auh.. uhm.. FOALS!? ME?!" He stammered out.

Rarity: "..oh, that REMINDS me, Darling." She moved her snoot right to his face. "We must be wed within the month, or I'm going to start showing."

Dusk: "Ahhhhhh.. WH-WHAT?!" He looked like a stunned goat.

K: "You're going to be a dad and a husband." I nodded.

Rarity: "Now, now, darling. I expect a nice ring and the full proposal ceremony." She shoo'd him. "K, darling? As my former lover and trusted friend.. HELP HIM!" She bugged her eyes at me.

K: "Come on, Senior." I grabbed him by the tail - he was literally too stunned to walk - and dragged him out, dumbfounded. "You should have known better than to engage 'battle' like that, so often, without protection..."

To make things entirely worse, Applejack found us. She was with Toola Roola, too.

K: "Hey, guess what? Rarity's getting married!" I smiled, and moved Dusk out ahead of me.

Dusk: "AH-ah.. Misus K---." He bowed his head, again, being ever so formal. "I seem to have.." He shrugged.

Toola Roola: "Mm." She smiled, then beamed. "I GET TO PAINT YOUR WEDDING PICTURE, DON'T I!?" She pawed at him.

Dusk: "Well.. well sure!" He nodded, stiffening up, but getting his bearings under him.

Applejack: "Mm.. An' Rarity'd normally be the one'd be plannin' this shindig." She rubbed her right fetlock on her chin. "Looks like it'll be me'n'you, Toola." She nodded. "Honeybun, c'n y'all handle the coltfolk?"

K: "Under control, my love." I gave her a thumb's up. "Come on, Dusk." I patted his shoulders. "First, engagement ring."

Dusk: "..I'm going to admit it, right now, K." He sighed. "I have no idea. This is all moving so fast."

K: "You love her, right?" I asked, as we walked.

Dusk: "I.." He BLUSHED! "..with my whole heart."

K: "Then you'll be fine." I smiled.

Dusk: "I-I just don't.. know.. anything.. about foals.." He stammered a bit.

K: "You'll figure it out." I nodded. "Look, man, it's like anything else in life - it's a learning experience. Rarity has experience, helping raise Sweetie. Listen to her, open your heart, open your mind, and relax." I gave him another pat on the shoulder. "Besides, that whole thing with your dad? You gonna repeat that mistake, or are you going to encourage them to follow their heart?"

Dusk: "Yeah.." He nodded slowly, then faster. "Yeah!" He stood upright, as he walked. "I'm.. if anything else.. I can look back at what went wrong with me and Dad.. and not make the same mistakes."

K: "There you go, Senior." I nodded, almost militarily. "To an extent, approach this as an 18-year campaign. Learn everything, be open to new tactics, and.." I looked over at him. "..smile."

He did. Probably for the first time in a very, very long time.. he did. Fully, proudly, without any shame.

Little did I know, however, that this event would literally change the future.

Butterfly wings.

Forest Spirit: "FORMATION..!" He called, raising his Marine Saber.

Ironhide: "ROYAL GUARD!"

Shining Copper: "SOLAR GUARD!"

Wispy Shadows: "LUNAR GUARD!"

Philippe Saquet: "C-A-G!"

Blinda: "ROYAL MARINES!"

Silver Spark: "ROYAL ARMY!"

Spitfire: "ROYAL AIR FORCE!"

Sargasso Sea: "ROYAL NAVY!"

Chemical Lens: "ROYAL GENDARMES!"

Forest Spirit: "..ATTEN-HUH!"

The mass of soldiers stapped to attention. The Royal Guard Band struck up The Wedding March. And the pagentry began.

Not only had we made Rarity and Dusk take a little extra time, they both agreed that it would only be fitting to be wed early in the morning on Nightmare Night. Luna's special day.

Who.. who was pregnant, now, by the way, after MUCH convincing on Dusk's part. He agreed, finally. I already told him he'd be their Godfather, and responsible for raising them if I did die or was sent back. He fully agreed there, just as Forest Spirit had.

Dusk was in his formal uniform - a highly embellished version of his basic uniform with large, open lapels and silver piping, befitting his new rank. Rarity was in a wedding gown she'd designed for herself LONG ago.. but never thought she'd wear.

We marched right on in.

Dusk: "..this is my dad's place. The... uh.. jeweler is across the street." He shrugged, as I about dragged him in.

K: "Major life changes means you need to finish fixing that bridge, Dusk." I said in a soft tone.

Dusk: "I suppose.. I suppose I do." He shrugged. "Father?!"

Brindle: "Ah. Dusk." He came out from the office. "How can I help you lads?" His tone wans't loving, but it wasn't anger, either.

Dusk: "Ah." He fidgeted.

One of the BRAVEST ponies I've ever met, and HE FIDGETED like a schoolcolt.

K: "Go on." I nudged him.

Dusk: "I-I need to get married.. Dad." He blushed a bit.

Brindle: "Huh." His face was neutral. "About time I got some Luna-damned grandfoals." He then gave a small smirk.

Dusk: "I.." He looked down and away.

Brindle: "You don't know what to do next, do you." That wasn't a question.

Dusk: "Not really." He shrugged.

Brindle: "You want an engagement ring, but you haven't the faintest idea what to get." Again, not asking.

Dusk: "Exactly." He shrug-fidgeted again.

Brindle: "Come here, son." He said, more softly.

We followed Mr. Spindle to the back area, which was his private residence. Up the stairs. I noted there were a lot of pictures of Dusk, his mother, and his father in here. She seemed like a very pretty mare. A bit refined, too.

We entered his bedroom, and Brindle went over to a small chest on the long-abandoned vanity. He opened it, and pulled out a ring box.

Brindle: "This is for when you DO tie the knot. These were me and your mother's." He passed it over to him.

Dusk: "D-Dad!" He was shook.

Brindle: "Look, Dusk.. we.. we had our problems. I want you to know that.. I really do love you. You're my son. We just.. didn't get along so well without your mom." He shrugged. "I want to put that behind us." He looked at a photo of her, near the mirror on the vanity. "She would have wanted that."

Dusk: "I.. I suppose so." He nodded, then smiled a bit. "I'd like that, too, Dad." He cleared his throat a bit, regaining his bearing. "Kids gotta know their grandpa."

Brindle: "That's the spirit." He nodded, and smiled as well. "SO! Who you picked as your best stallion?" He smirked.

Dusk: "It's a toss-up between.." He looked down and away. "..no, no it shouldn't be." He turned to me. "I was going to say Darkening Stars or Spirit Moons. I've served with them. Before." He shook his head. "No. YOU.. you made this possible, K." He nodded to me. "Would you.. heh.. be my best human?" And smiled.

K: "It would be my supreme honor." I bowed a bit. "We're friends, now, Dusk."

Dusk: "Best friends. You literally gave me.." He shook his head. "..you helped fix my family, and you set me up to have one of my own, and.." He glanced away. "..eh, Dad? How would you feel beign grand-uncle to Luna and K's foals, too?"

Brindle: "Wh-WHAT?!" His jaw hit the floor.

---Present Day---


I stood at the Altar with Father Waddle. Despite this being at the Royal Chapel, Bishop Purelight would not be officiating. I was standing in my formal uniform with the Groomscolts - Broken Dawn, Golden Wattle, Blazing Star, Walden Shield, Ironhide, Sunshine Smiles, and Dr. Allcome. Next to me as.. Best Dragon.. was Spike.

On the other side was the Bridal Party. Maid of Honor Luna, with Co-Maid of Honor Applejack, Rose Pompadour, Toola Roola, Fluttershy, Misty Stars, Lute Sunray, Raven Inkswell, and Rainbow Dash.

Getting the picture, yet?

In the lead was Dusk and Rarity as the band started to reach the middle of the song. Behind them.. was Twilight Sparkle.. and Flash Sentry.

LOCATION: Rarity's Botique, Ponyville, Erie, Equestria


The ring I helped him pick out was a custom job. The sword part of his Cutie Mark stuck into a Diamond like Rarity's Cutie Mark. He picked a Tail Ring for this. As I now understood it, both forearm bands, and tail rings were acceptable for an engagement. A circlet or a forearm band was acceptable for marriage. As they were Unicorns, HORN bands were also acceptable for marriage. And that's what his father and mother had worn.

K: "Rarity, you in?" I stepped inside, to find Twilight curled up on the couch, with Spike patting her mane.

Dusk: "Uh-oh." He blinked. "Spike, what's wrong?"

Spike: "Ahhhh..." He shrugged. "...Twilight found out Rarity was pregnant."

Twilight: "..I'm not sure what to do." She stared blankly at the floor.

I moved and sat next to her.

K: "What do you mean? Twi, you look like you've been crying." I pat her mane.

Twilight: *Horsey sigh* "I talked to Flash about it, and.." She nodded to the side. "He said it was irresponsible to get married during the war like this." She looked up at Dusk. "I.. I wanted him to ask me, too!" She started crying again, just the tears, though.

Dusk: "Are you.. uh.." He gestured.

Rarity: "She is not." Rarity stepped in, with therapeudic ice cream and cake.

K: "Don't matter. I know how they feel about each other." I shrugged. "Come on, Dusk. We gotta talk some sense into one of your subordinates." I patted him on the shoulder.

Rarity gave us both a look, knowing we'd be back.

We later found Flash at Rose's many-times rebuilt cafe (this time, she constructed it like a literal bunker, with cast concrere-and-rebar reinforced walls, painted decoratively, with a roof capable of withstanding a 500lbs armor piercing bomb). He was sitting, staring at a cup of tea. Looking very down.

K: "Flash." I sat next to him.

Dusk: "Flash." He greeted him by name as well, and sat across from him.

Flash Sentry: "Sirs." He nodded to us.

Dusk: "None of that." He snorted a bit. "Stallion to stallion.. er.. and human." He smirked a bit.

Flash: "Alright." He raised his head and looked at Dusk. "Why."

Dusk: "I got her pregnant. It's not right to not marry her. War or no war." He shrugged. "Besides, I love her with all my heart." He blushed a bit.

Flash: "I haven't." He frowned a little. "We.. haven't.. you know? We've kissed, though." He smiled a bit.

K: "Do you love her?" I leaned in a bit as Rose brought us coffee.

Rose: "Boy, does he." She smiled. "K, he's so love sick for her, when I brought him a salad the other day when they were on a date, he ate the flowers on the table instead. AND SHE DIDN'T NOTICE!" She giggled, and nodded. "They're as bad as you and AJ. Or him and Rarity." She nodded to Dusk.

Flash: "Ergh." He frowned and looked down.

K: "I know w-"

Dusk: "-hat's going through your mind. It went through mine. I'm sure.." He nodded to me.

K: "Yeah." I shrugged.

Dusk: "I had a lot of other hang-ups." He scowled. "Self-doubt, not.. knowing if I was ready, but the big one.. what if I die?"

Flash: "I don't want to hurt her like that!" He nodded firmly, almost tearing up.

K: "Then, don't." I shrugged, with a tiny grin. "Yeah, it's a war, but let that promise power you towards refining your skill until you're faster, stronger, and better able to protect her, and stayt alive." I nodded to him.

Dusk: "We're both looking at the same thing, Flash." He leaned over and patted his foreleg. "I got foals to worry about, too." He shrugged. "Look.. Twi loves you back, colt. She wants this."

K: "She does." I nodded. "And you make a perfect pair. Twilight Sentry? I think that sounds pretty awesome." I smirked.

Dusk: "Plus, it'll give you a reason to win and come back - to share the victory with her." He nodded slowly.

Flash: "Oh." He blinked. "Thanks, guys." He smiled. "I guess you're right."

---Present Day---


The couples made it to the Altar and took position. I stood straight up, smiling. Flash AND Dusk. Rarity AND Twilight. It was too perfect.

Father Waddle: "Ladies and Gentlecolts.. today, we come here, in the Presence of our Goddesses to celebrate the union of Holy Matrimony." He held his hooves out before them. "Dusk Seeker and Rarity Belle. Flash Sentry and Twilight Sparkle. Do you all come here in the presence of Goddess Celestia and Goddess Luna, of your own free will? Without coercion, with love in your hearts?"

Brides & Grooms: "WE DO!"

Father  Waddle: "Are you prepared, as you follow the path of matrimony, to honor, love and cherish each other for all of your days?"

Grooms & Brides: "We do!"

Father  Waddle: "Are you prepared to raise your foals, in the love and harmony of Celestia's word?"

Grooms & Brides: "We do!"

Father  Waddle: "Then, before we shall continue, let any who object to these unions, speak now, or forever hold thy peace..!"

Dusk: "So, Flash and I are going in on this 50/50. Partly because the wives are best friends. Sir." He nodded to Ironhide. "We both wanted you to be a Groomscolt."

Ironhide: "Makes sense." He shrugged. "K."

K: "Ironhide. You've been the Boss since we lost Steelhoof and Shining Armor." I gestured to him. "You've always been there. We.. really couldn't have gotten here without you."

Ironhide: "I guess so, huh!" He smiled. "Flash."

Flash: "I feel the same way, sir." He shrugged.

Ironhide: "Who else're you asking?" He glanced around.

Dusk: "Sunshine, Broken, Golden.." He shrugged.

Flash: "..Dr. Allcome, Walden, and Blazing." He shrugged as well.

K: "I'm going to be Dusk's Best Human, and.. Flash wants Spike to be Best Dragon for him." I said, reaching over, and refilling everyone's tea.

Ironhide: "And I'm the.. middle choice. The one that brings both sides together." He nodded, with a smile. "I like it."

K: "Pretty much." I nodded. "That and if anything strange happens.." I smirked. "I know you'll take a bullet for either of them."

Ironhide: "In an instant." He nodded, looking at them both. "All seriousness, I see the next two Commanders of the Guard right here."

Dusk: "SIR!" He was taken aback.

Flash: "ME!?" He blinked.

Ironhide: "Easily. You're about ten years apart as it is. I'm probably going to retire after the war's over." He shrugged. "I'm 51 now, come on. This is a young colt's game."

Dusk: "And you want me to replace you?" He cocked a brow.

Ironhide: "Yeah." He nodded. "Probably in about ten years. Meaning you'll do a stint as Captain of the Lunar Guard, and Flash as Captain of the Solar Guard." He looked at me. "You did authorize both posts to be raised to OF-09."

K: "I did." I nodded.

Dusk: "And I'll probably retire when I become a grandfather myself.. meaning.. I'll pick Flash, most likely." He nodded to himself, sipping the tea. "Makes sense."

Flash: "I'll.. do my best, sir, you know that." He nodded firmly.

Ironhide: "Good. We can start by promoting you to Senior. Since you're Twilight's bodyguard." He shrugged a bit. "K?"

K: "Mm." I nodded, and pulled out the box holding his new silver star.

Guns. LOTS AND LOTS OF GUNS. Guns from everywhere. From under dresses and from within handbags. Rifles loaded and chambered. Sword of Rainbow's Light in my hand, I moved ahead of Dusk and Flash, PUSHING them behind me, as Ironhide took position next to me, catching a Grant rifle from another Guard.

Over on the side, Luna's Guard just abous pushed her to the ground. Celestia's Guard formed an immediate defensive ring around her, holding her back, but also taking position - with Unicorns in front - to take hits for her.

The entire wedding party, and almost every celebrant, had a weapon out and ready for her.

K: "HOW IN THE GREAT BLUE FUCK!" I demanded, aiming the sword at her.

Trixie: "You know what, human? I'm not entirely sure." She stood there, though, in a rather nice formal gown.

K: "This is-" I stopped, and looked over at Dr. Whooves.

Dr. Whooves: "-THE SPELL." He moved over to me, looked at me, then her. "It-It's the only thing that could have! You said she died right on that Sigil?"

Katrina: "The Sigil!" She pointed at Trixie. "YOU DREW A SIGIL OF SOUL WARDING INSIDE THE SEAL BREAKER!"

Trixie: "Ohhh.." She blinked. "Sounds like something I'd do." She shrugged.

I moved ahead of everyone, and motioned for them all to safety their weapons and magic.

K: "Trixie, what's the last thing you remember?" I said, kneeling down about.. 20 feet from her.

Trixie: "I.." She looked down. "..remember meeting Tirek. He offered me power beyond comprehension. He offered me a chance to get back at.." She looked at Twilight. "..you." And shrugged.

Twilight: "F-For the Ursa." She blinked, and lowered her Abrams.

K: "Kat. Is it possible that Starlight Glimmer's time spell activated the Sigil that Trixie drew?" I looked back to her.

Katrina: "Yes. Actually, if my math is right, that's the only thing that could have - some kind of Temporal Effect spell of Magnitude 6 or greater." She shrugged. "Glimmer's was a pair of 12's."

K: "In English. Er.. for the ones in the cheap seats." I shrugged.

Katrina: "Trixie.. did you.." She looked down, then up. "..did you perform a Soul Warding Ceremony after you met with Tirek?"

Trixie: "I.." She said breathlessly. "I did! I.. I thought it was a trick! I thought he was going to kill me!"

K: "How long have you been back here?" I asked, plainly.

Trixie: "I.. I was at that town around the Sigil a while ago. I took a train back to Canida.. and.. I learned about the war." She sighed. "And I learned what I'd done."

K: "Do you regret it?" I tilted my head.

Trixie: "Oh, my Celestia!" She threw her face into her hooves and started sobbing. "HE REALLY GOT TO ME, didn't he?!"

It struck me that the true depths of her depravity were NOT public knowledge.. but enough of them were.

Celestia: "..let me through." She moved her guards aside and paced up to where I was. "Trixie. Soul Warding is forbidden, you know. It's very dangerous. So is Temporal Effect Magic."

Trixie: "..yeah." She looked down, bowing to Celestia. "I.. know I sided with Tirek.. and I messed up BAD.. I.. I led an invasion, controlled Neighpon for a time.. helped hold Princess Cadence hostage.. and almost unsealed the Avegir." She was still crying. "Please. I'm a worthless stage magician.. I.. I don't deserve anything but the dungeon for what I ended up doing...!" She threw herself at Celestia's hooves. "PLEASE! PLEASE, PRINCESS! I'm SORRY! I don't.. I wasn't.. I can't REMEMBER any of it BUT I KNOW I DID IT!"

K: "..I forgive you." I stood up and reholstered my M-19.

EVERYONE GASPED IN SHOCK.

Twilight: "I.." She paced over to the sobbing Trixie. "I'm willing to forgive you, too." She showed her the scar on her neck. "You did this. But not this you. You deserve a second chance." And held out her hoof.

Everyone gasped again!

Dusk: "...ME TOO!" He marched over, almost ahead of me, and helped Trixie up to her hooves. "I was.. I.. I got badly hurt at the Dragon Migration Incident and I thought I was done as a Guard. The one thing I was born to do. K gave me a second chance to prove myself. I want to extend that same second chance." He looked at EVERYONE in the crowd. "TWILIGHT WENT ON ABOUT THE TRIXIE EFFECT! THAT PUSHING SOMEPONY AWAY WOULD JUST LEAD TO THEM BECOMING EVIL! WE.. WE.. ALL.. HAVE A SECOND CHANCE TO MAKE THIS RIGHT! AND WE NEED TO! RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW! WE NEED TO WELCOME HER BACK TO THE HERD, OR WE'RE ALL A BUNCH OF HYPOCRITES! AND IF WE'RE ALL A BUNCH OF HYPOCRITES ABOUT LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP, THEN WHAT THE TARTARUS ARE WE FIGHTING AND DYING FOR?!" He.. paused.. realizing what speech he just made, but stood straight up, next to me, and nodded.

Trixie: "You'd.. forgive a worthless stage mare like me?!" She sniffled.

Celestia: "Yes, My Little Pony. Now, come join the wedding party." She ushured her up the aisle with her wing. "There's cake afterwards."

K: "And Rose made Lasagna." I nodded.

Trixie: "I-I.. love Lasagna.." She sniffled, mewling, as we brought her back into the herd.

So, that's how Dusk, Rarity, Flash, and Twilight were wed. How some VERY SMART "mere showmare" managed to literally save a backup copy of herself from before her bad decision, how someone that would have been her best friend managed to activate that, bring her back, and save her life.

And how we, as a SPECIES..

..overcame the Trixie Effect.

We didn't realize how much this just changed the future.

Or.. as I always say.. Friendship is Magic.
