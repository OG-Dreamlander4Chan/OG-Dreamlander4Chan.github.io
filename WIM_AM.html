	<TD width=1200><div style="width:1500px;overflow:auto"><pre>Kingdom of Ambleion
(Officially, the United Kingdom of Greater Ambleon, Wales, Cornwall, Manx, Scotland and Ironland)

Much like its Earth counterpart, Ambleion is a Kingdom made up of several constituent parts. Unlike Germenaigh, these parts are not autonomous entities within the greater Kingdom, but all part of the greater realm. They do, however, each have their own noble houses, their own military units, and so forth.

Governmentally, Ambleion has a Parliamentary-Assited Absolute Monarchy. That is, the Crown Princess (Margaret II, currently) has absolute authority within the Realm over all matters. However, much of her power is delegated to Parliament, to ease governmental matters and take pressure off of the Royal government, while allowing a voice to the subjects and royals.

Again, much like its Earth counterpart, this Legislature is bicameral, with the House of Lords and House of Commons. The House of Lords, however, has strict entrance requirements - only someone directly granted, or the inheritor of, a noble title has a right to a seat at the House of Lords. They may designate a Plenipotentiary to sit in their place. The representatives of the House of Commons are selected by the County Magistrates of each County in the Kingdom.

Ambleion's history is similar to its Earth counterpart, with much of it shaded by the realities of the world. The origin of the current Ambleonian nation has its roots in a Heptarchy of smaller kingdoms as far back as 102 C.S. They were finally unified under Aethelbald the Wise in 408 C.S., as a gradual incorporation of the Mercyian Kingdom of the lands around it, though it takes its name from the East Amblers.

The adoption of the term "Ambleon" came from the East Amblian Kingdoms. In 207 C.S., the Crown Prince of Mercia, Pendant, became the sole leader of a Personal Union between Mercia and East Amblia, with the death of his mother. Seeking a way to unify the two Kingdoms, it was agreed that the throne be referred to as "The Throne of Ambleon," in exchange for the East Amblers adopting Mercyan rule.

Over time, the "Throne of Ambleon" absorbed the Seaxlands - Wessesx, Essex, Sussex. The Kingdom of Cornovii remained independent, but in alliance with the Ambleon Throne. Likewise, Wales agreed to become a part of the Kingdom as long as they retained nominal independence - both of these entities having their names added to the title of the nation.

Many of these absorbtions took place with pure negotiation - offers of better trade, industry, and friendship. The conquest of the Regnilands - a breakaway of the Sussex Kingdom - was, however, violent, by the world's standards. Rotbert and his brother Strongwill were forced to fight Numbna the Pretender, who had crowned himself King of the Regni, at the Battle of Hastings, in 566 C.S.

After the Battle of Hastings, all of "lower Ambleon" was in the hands of the Throne of Ambleon. This left only the lands of the Scots, and the Isle of Manx, with Manx voluntarily becoming part of Ambleon in exchange for retaining local home rule in 570 C.S., and the War of the Scots from 573 to 577 cementing Ambleonian rule.

In 927 C.S., the Kingdom of Ironland was conquered by Ambleon. It was a fairly peacable conquest, in that the Ambleonians showed up and declared Ironland part of their realm. There was violence, but the Ambleonian Army was quite thorough in repressing this at every opportunity - both with violence and with bribery. The last Crown Prince of Ironland, Phaedrig XI, went into exile in Equestria, who then warned Ambleion that further conquest of this kind would not be tolerated. This ended the "Ambition to Ambleon," largely, and resulted in a backslide of Ambleonian military readiness, and the loss of their colonies.

To this day, there is resentment of Ambleonian Rule in Ironland to some degree, but in the general sense of things, this is more of an attitude and less of a violent movement. There is a political party in Ironland, "Éire ar Dtús," that advocates for Ironish independence. With the Great War against Tirek, these feelings are on the back burner.
