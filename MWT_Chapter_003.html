Part 1: Pit March

TIME: 16:12 NERST

LOCATION: North of Great Mareington, Maresechusetts, New Equestria


It was getting towards late afternoon. I was tired. I sat down on a rock, and motioned to everyone to stop.

Zipp: (To Hitch) "And he was the great hero?" She muttered.

Sunny: "I can hear you." She flicked an eye at Zipp.

K: "Zipp, I'm 44 years old. I spent the last ten years taking care of my dying wife. I didn't fight or train or anything in that time. Moreover, I wasn't in-shape until I got here. When I went back, I lost all my gains." I shrugged. "I'm past my prime in human years, and it shows. It's going to take me months to get back in any kind of shape."

Zipp: "Oh." She shrugged. "Sorry."

Izzy: "He just needs time." She bounced a bit. "We can stop early tonight!" She paced over into the woods, and came back a short time later, with all kinds of different things. "Mister Rock needs something." She smiled.

Hitch: "Anyway.. yeah." He pointed to a small cabin that was abandoned, but in decent shape. "That's a good spot to stop."

K: "Yeeep." I groaned as I got up, and downed the rest of my canteen. "Come on." I gestured.

Zipp: "Sorry.. K... just.. I'm used to high speed, low drag, yanno?" She tilted her head, pacing up next to me. "And what little I -do- know about you, you were supposed to be the best."

K: "That was the past." I nodded. "I need to get back in shape and start a new future." I gestured.

Sunny: "You can do it, Grandpa." She nodded.

Izzy: "Your sparkle will shine - just wait." She nodded, as she got the door open.

A few forest critters cleared out as we entered.

I noticed Hitch follow them with his eyes, carefully. And shrugged, as Zipp stepped in and whipped out her cell phone.

Zipp: "Sixteen-thirty hours, 12th of Septimus." She started. "Bivouacking early. Cabin in the woods, north of Mareington." She looked around.

K: "What's all your training, Zipp?" I asked, casually.

Zipp: "Oh, I did a rotation with the AFSOC team." She shrugged. "And I've got my training and interest in investigations." She gestured.

K: "You seemed awfully interested in me appearing in Bridlewood." I said, sitting down.

Zipp: *T'chah* "Yeah. It's like.." She held her hooves up, looking at the paws of her mitts. "..no one cares about anything any more. They just go along to get along."

K: "You feel the magic of friendship might be.. losing something?" I leaned in a bit.

Zipp: "Yeah... maybe..." She looked sullen, all of a sudden.

K: "And, let me guess, your senior officers see you as a wild mustang that won't calm down, and just.. go along to get along?" I smirked, leaning in behind her head.

Zipp: "Yeah! Exactly! They never give me any credit!" She swept her hoof wide. "And when I have concerns? They never authorize me to do anything about it." She nodded. "Then, I do it, and they just act like it was all their idea or whatever." She snorted.

K: "Well, I'm the exact opposite. You seem to have good instincts. I trust you." I pat her on the shoulder. "If you need to investigate something, though, I only ask you tell me everything, without reservations or fears. I listen, and I listen good to the ponies that have skill and talent. That's why.." I stepped away to help build the fire. "..I want you in CAG."

Zipp: "WHAT?!" She looked at me, stunned. "REALLY?!"

K: "Yup." I nodded, helping build the fire.

Zipp: "Oh, zip-eriffic!" She smiled, broadly.

Sunny: "Friends?" She held out her hoof.

Zipp: "Friends!" She shook, but Izzy dove in and hugged them both.

So, Sunny, Izzy, Zipp, and Hitch. My team was growing. We settled in for the evening, and drew shifts. Sunny made sure I was taking salt tablets, to keep my electrolytes up, and made sure I had an electrolyte powder drink extra. Dinner was ration oats, a large tin of beans we found in one of the cupboards that was nearing but not at its expiry date, and some hardtack soaked into the beans.

The others actually fell asleep on me, leaving me with Zipp.

Zipp: "Is it bad that I want to see you chew out my CO?" She smirked.

K: "Nah, not at all." I shrugged. "Who are they?"

Zipp: "Major Parsley." She nodded.

K: "Oh, you dropped this." I pulled out her ID card, and handed it to her.

Zipp: "Huh!" She smirked. "Funny that I'm the one looking for clues all the time, and I left one behind like that." She shrugged her wings.

K: "I hope I can find out what direction I need to go on. Strategically speaking." I nodded.

Zipp: "I think you can." She smiled a bit. "At least I know, you'll never blow me off."

K: "Never." I grinned.

We heard something moving outside. Something big. Something kinda scary sounding. It was Hitch's watch, and he just poked all of us to get us up. We all, quietly, got to our weapons. I opened one of the cabin windows, closed with shutters, and I was greeted by the sight of something that looked almost..

K: "GIZMONK!" I aimed at it, my eyes identifying a weapon in its hands, thumb flicked the Manticore to hyperburst, and I fired. The recoil almost pushed me over, I wasn't ready for it.

Hitch: "WHAT'S THAT?!" He opened the window by him, and two of them dove through, trying to grab at him.

Sunny: "GET OFF HIM!" She charged forwards, and mule kicked, sending one into a wall, and the other back out the window.

Zipp got up next to me, and pulled her sidearm, quickly mounting the suppressor, and starting to fire shots at anything moving. Izzy moved to the windows facing the back, and started shooting her Manticore first on single shot, then seeing as that was less than effective, switched to full auto - hers was set around 600 rounds a minute, and that was quite controllable.

One Hitch got back up, he fired a Flare grenade out of the window at an upwards angle. The area was illuminated, and I could see these "Gizmonks" now - whatever they were, they were solidly black, with glowing yellow eyes, but wearing clothes and carrying rifles. They fired back intermittently, and we returned fire smartly, now that we could see them.

When they went down, they stayed down.

It was over quickly, with several of them breaking and running for the treeline. Before I could stop her, Zipp got a running start, and threw herself out of the window, catching some air for a moment, and firing down at them rapidly, expending a full magazine before landing, and killing the last four before they could make good their escape.

Attacked in the middle of the night by a Platoon-sized force. By something. Some one. I had no idea what or who, but I knew my enemy when I saw them.

That made my return even more dangerous. For everyone.

The attack had been sudden, but I got to see that my new team had it together. They could fight, and they could kill, without having to be coached into it. I had a feeling, that like ponies were, they would do whatever was needed to protect their friends. Even if it meant taking lives.

Also, it looked that, despite the lack of magic, Zipp could fly? I knew for a fact that Pegasi flight was magical. And if Magic was sealed, this made no sense.

Once it was over, and Zipp came back in, Sunny was astounded.

Sunny: "YOU CAN FLY!" She pointed at her.

Zipp: "Aaaaaaaaahhhh.... not.. quite?" She tilted her head.

Hitch: "Then what do you call what you just did?" He gestured his foreleg at her.

Zipp: "F-Falling with.. style?" She rubbed her right fetlock on her right upper foreleg.

K: "You can glide." I nodded. "I'm guessing that's the closest any Pegasi has to actual flight?"

Zipp: "Y-Yeah.." She sighed and lowered her head. "Please don't tell.."

Sunny: "No, no, I get it, you're fine!" She hugged her. "Still, that's so awesome!"

Izzy: "I guess it's like me being able to see everyone's sparkle!" She chimed in, and slid between the other two mares. "Like, I can tell all kinds of things by looking at your Sparkle. You gotta let it shiiiiine!" She waved her foreleg in front of her, slowly.

K: "..we have a problem." I said, having finished examining the corpse. "These things are real." I turned, looking at them.

Hitch: "Well, I mean, it looks real enough to me." He shrugged.

Zipp: "Nooo, Hitch. K means these are living creatures." She moved over and examined the corpse herself. "And they bleed red blood."

K: "Whatever it is that's causing this blackness? I don't know." I shrugged. "But.. something is controlling these creatures." I gestured at the dead body. "This is a Gizmonk. Yes, it's slightly mutated from what I recall, but.. it's still a Gizmonk. A lot of them worked for Tirek a thousand years ago." I sighed.

Izzy: "You don't think Tirek's back, do you?" She tilted her head.

K: "No. This is something else." I dragged the corpse over into the light better. "But, whatever it is, it knows I'm here, now. And I have a feeling, these were sent to stop me. Stop us. From doing whatever it is we need to do." I shrugged. "Alright, let's police the bodies."

I went over and picked up the rifle it had been carrying. It was strange, it looked like a Bradley. It took me a bit to remember how to take it apart, but I did. And what I found, shocked me even more.

Hitch: "What's up, K?" He leaned over. "Uh - SUNNY!"

Sunny: "What's up, Hitch?" She leaned in. "Oh.. no."

There on the bolt was a proof stamp from the Appleloosa Arsenal. In Texas. I held it up, and showed it off.

K: "Someone stole my factory." I frowned. "And they're using it."

Izzy: "Yeah." She poked the bolt with her hoof. "No chance this was copied or anything." She shrugged.

I explained that the Appleloosa Arsenal was the first major weapons factory that we had. And what we went through to get it.

Zipp: "Zero-zero-seven hours, 13th. Attacked by platoon sized formation of enemies - K calls them Gizmonks. They were armed with one thousand year old assault rifles, apparently made at Appleloosa Arsenal in the lost land of Texas." She said, into her cell phone.

K: "Good. Take notes. We might need them later." I nodded to her.

Hitch: "I'll go police up the bodies." He nodded.

Izzy: "I'll help!" She bounced after him.

Sunny: "What does this mean?" She shrugged.

K: "I think.. like I said.. someone knows I'm here and they're trying to stop us." I shrugged.

Zipp: "It's bad." She looked at me. "Can I give you a briefing?"

K: "Give me everything." I nodded.

Zipp: "I've been following strange incidents for the last several months. Odd stuff. Stolen goods, missing ponies, sightings of creatures no one has seen before." She shrugged. "Most of it is in my office. I didn't know.. didn't think.. you might come back, or.. even if you were real, but.." She dismissively waved. "..I'm starting to think this is all related." She nodded. "After you meet the Prime Minister, I'll show you everything." She looked at Sunny. "I don't know the old legends, so, this is all new to me. I'm trying to come at this from an investigative perspective."

Sunny: "I know all about the old legends. I can teach you - and so can K. He IS most of those legends." She nodded vigorously.

K: "Well, we'll see what we can do." I shrugged. "Once we get to Pitfield, we'll see if we can get a riverboat to the north."

Zipp: "I took one from the Greenbrooke border to Pitfield, and I caught a ride with a Gendarmes unit to the Erie border." She looked at me. "That's how I caught up with you."

K: "Understood." I nodded. "I mean, we spent a few days in Bridlewood. Where were you when you found out about me?"

Zipp: "Pitfield. I overheard.. well.. spied.. on a radio report saying someone strange arrived in Bridlewood." She shrugged her wings. "So, I headed towards it and kinda met you part way."

K: "Makes sense. How long would a riverboat trip take to the Greenbrooke border?" I nodded to her as Hitch and Izzy came back in.

Zipp: "Less than a day." She smiled.

K: "Good." I nodded.

I wanted to meet the Prime Minister as soon as possible. This was getting serious, and security had to be on alert throughout whatever there was of the kingdom. If they attacked me here, they might attack elsewhere.

Part 3: At the Pit

TIME: 17:17 NERST

LOCATION: Pitfield, Maresechusetts, New Equestria


Pitfield was a proper town. Once we entered, we were taken by "golf cart" to the Gendarmes Station. Sheriff Capped Lens was there to greet us. She looked exactly like a female Wide Lens. And she knew immediately who I was.

Cap: "GENERAL K!" She dove into my arms. "Oh, hi, Hitch." She said dismissively.

K: "GACK!" I was almost being strangled, she was quite strong.

Cap: "Call me Cap." She kissed my cheek. "OH my STARS and HOOVES, I'm so glad the legends were true." She pulled on me and showed me a magnifying glass, encased in a glass case. "This was grandma's." She pointed to it with her hoof. "It's been passed down in my family for generations - that you'd come. You'd save us."

Zipp: "Sheriff." She nodded.

Cap: "Captain!" She smiled. "I got those incident reports you asked for."

Zipp: "Ziptastic." She smirked.

K: "So, you're descended from Chemical and Wide, right?" I asked.

Cap: "Sure am." She nodded. "There's a hoofful of us around." She shrugged. "If you go to Cupcake Falls, you can meet someone who descended from the Cakes."

K: "Well, at least there's some that'll know who I am." I shrugged.

Cap: "Yeah." She smiled, wistfully. "But, it also means trouble." She leaned over to the radio. C> "This is Golf-Alpha-One-One to all patrols. Yellow alert. Shift C report to your posts." And shrugged.

Hitch: "So, Cap.. incident reports?" He shrugged.

Cap: "Yeah, yeah, Captain Storm wanted to know if any strange and unsolvable crimes have been happening. So, I took a look, and sure enough, we've got 16 incidents that are very, very unusual." She shrugged wide with one hoof. "My hoofness, you must all be worn out." She handed Zipp the files. "Go to The Pit Hotel and they'll put you up for the night. You need anything else, K?" She went right to familiarity.

K: "Yeah, we need a ride to the Greenbroke Border." I nodded. "And you are right about trouble - we were attacked by 18 Gizmonks last night." I sighed.

Cap: "..yeah, I'll alert the town militia, too.." She frowned. "Hitch, if anything, you need to get Sprout's mom to send us more supplies. We could use another 10,000 rounds of 6mm, for example."

Hitch: "I mean, I can ask when I get back." He shrugged.

Cap: "I appreciate it." She looked at me. "Supplies are.. a bit of a mess." She frowned again, and shook her head.

K: "Zipp." I nodded to her.

Zipp: "Note for K. Get the logistic situation taken care of." She chirped her cell phone.

K: "I'll stop by in the morning for a formal report on your situation, Cap." I nodded firmly to her. "I can already say - Chem and Wide would be VERY proud of you." I smiled widely, even though I was tired.

Cap: "..thanks." She smiled, and teared up a bit. "You have no idea what that means."

K: "I do, though." I smiled, and hugged her again, before departing.

We made our way to the hotel, while Sunny kept pace with me.

Sunny: "I guess a lot of ponies are going to be looking up to you like that." She shrugged.

K: "I guess they will. The ones that know their heritage." I shrugged. "After a thousand years, not all of them will, or might even care." I gestured, as we entered a VERY nice looking hotel.

Handsome Suite: "Ah, greetings, General K and party." He came from behind the desk. "Sheriff Cap just called - we're to give you our best accommodations." He nodded. "Have you been to Pitfield before, General?"

K: "I drove through here chasing Unicorn Supremacists a thousand years ago." I shrugged. "Anyone from the Surge or Dasher families around?"

Handsome Suite: "Mmm.. not that I know of, not here anyway." He shook his head. "Sorry, General."

K: "Just K, please. And we'd like to get to our rooms as soon as possible." I leaned over and grabbed Izzy by the tail, parentally, as she was looking ready to disassemble one of their centerpieces.

Handsome Suite: "Of course!" He nodded, and led us to one of the nicer suites in the hotel. "I'll have food sent up - anything special? I know you'll want some meat, K - we have Auroch Steak."

K: "Sold." I nodded. "And coffee, if you have it."

Handsome Suite: "Of course." He nodded. "Sheriff? Ladies?" He looked at the others.

Hitch: "A cheese sandwich and carrots." He nodded.

Sunny: "Tomato soup if you have it. Or chicken." She smiled.

Izzy: "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..." She tapped her hoof on her chin. "..do you have Crystal Greens salad?"

Handsome Suite: "We do. Sparkly Greens, if you're alri-"

Izzy: "PLEASE!" She cheered.

Zipp: "I'll have a cheese sandwich and soup. Coffee, too." She shrugged her wings.

Handsome Suite: "Of course." He nodded. "I expect you'll want to see your sister, too, since she's in town - the Prime Minister's daughters visiting is always a treat. I'll let her know you've arrived." He pivoted and exited.

Zipp: "EH-! W-" She stammered, and we all looked at her.

K: "The Prime Minister's daughter..?" I cocked a brow.

Sunny: "And that means.. you're PIPP'S SISTER!" She lit up.

Hitch: "Oh, wow." He smiled.

Izzy: "I LOVE HER COOKING EPISODES!" She cheered.

Zipp: "A-aw.. come on, guys..!" She looked embarrassed.

K: "It's fine." I shrugged, and patted her shoulder. "An audience with your mother might go smoother if you're there." I shrugged.

Zipp: "Yeah, maybe." She shrugged. "Maybe YOU can talk some sense into her, K. She wants me to replace her when I get older." She frowned.

K: "So.. do you want to?" I tilted my head at her.

Zipp: "Maybe..?" She shrugged. "I mean, one member of my family has been the Prime Minister for the last 260 years."

K: "You're just not sure." I nodded.

Zipp: "I want to find my own way, first." She sighed, and paced over to one of the bed, and flopped on it. "Mom doesn't get that. She went right along with what Grandma wanted. Me? I want to do things. Investigate, be a detective, be an officer, do my duty, and.. help ponies." She snorted a sigh. "I don't think Pipp wants to be anything but a PonyTube star, and she's GOOD at it.."

K: "HAH! I'm so glad you have Internet here." I shrugged. "Sunny showed me one of her videos, but I wasn't sure how they were distributed."

Zipp: "Yeah.." She sighed again. "Goddess Galactica, just shoot me."

K: "Problems with your sister?" I asked.

Zipp: "No-no, nothing like that - I love Pipp, with all my heart. We.. growing up together.. it was..." She smiled, rolling over, and staring at the ceiling. "..but, you know, these days, I want to do my investigations, and I don't want her to get hurt. Since she's ALSO Haven's daughter, she has protection." She lolled her head. "I'd lose it if something happened to her. It's why I've tried to keep her at hoof's length, lately. Goddess, I hope she isn't mad-"

Pipp: "Y-You mean it?!" She strode right in. "Zipp!?"

Zipp shot up to her hooves instantly, realizing she'd been there the whole time.

Zipp: "PIPP!" She blinked. "Ah, I-Er.." She lowered her head. "..yeah, sorry I haven't been around much, lately.."

Pipp: "It's just.." She slid over to her and hugged her sister. "..I thought YOU were mad at ME or something."

Zipp: "Nah, never." She hugged back. "I couldn't ever be mad at you." She sighed, wistfully. "Just, you have your show, and.." She stepped back. "..I didn't want you to be in danger. And worse, a gun battle might interrupt your live streams." She giggled, and so did Pipp.

K: "Well, then, it's nice to meet you, Pipp." I said, announcing myself.

Pipp: "Wait.." She turned, looked, and JUST realized I was there. She went for her cell phone, but Zipp stopped her. "Ziiiiiiiiiiiiiipppp! THIS. IS. Ha-yoo-uuuge! I've GOT to-"

Zipp: "Let it go, for now." She stated. "General K needs to meet Mom and Princess Theia. THEN we can announce that he's back. If you do it too soon or wrong, ponies could get hurt or worse." She shrugged. "We.. we were attacked last night."

K: "We were." I nodded. "Also, you look like you hug good. May I?" I held my arms out, and after a moment's thought, she jumped into them and hugged me.

Pipp: "Okay.. TOTALLY a note for later, but the stories are true - you DO hug good!" She smiled.

Sunny: "I'm Sunny, and this is Hitch and Izzy. K's my grandpa." She smiled.

Hitch: "Heya!" He smiled, and waved a bit.

Izzy: "Hii-iiii!" She cheered.

How was I going to handle Pipp? I wasn't sure, yet. A media mogul, a face to the world. The idea that I could keep the world informed about what I was doing.. was fascinating. I could show Ponies that, together, we could do anything. I was at one hand elated, and at another, a little reserved. I'd have to keep a handle on her. Not that I wasn't used to it - Elsie Bon Voyage came to mind.

Still, we had a new friend. And Friendship is Magic.

Part 4: River Rats

LOCATION: Pitfield, Maresechusetts, New Equestria


We had access to a river boat, thanks to Sheriff Cap. The river boat was technically co-owned by the Gendarmes and the town itself. It transported people and goods from Zephyr Heights to points south, so it made regular trips down the Husatonic. Most trips were directly to Pitfield, and then once a week, down south further to Cobnecticut.

We got up early, so we could meet the river boat, and get on board before it needed to leave. Pipp held my arrival a secret, and did her morning podcast with her sister, though at my suggestion, she asked her "Pippsqueaks" to report any strange sightings. It then showed me that I could do this, too - appeal to the masses for help.

The river boat captain was very happy to have us aboard. The riverboat had a machine gun, but no other weapons. The machine gun was interesting - it bore a structural resemblance to the Abrams, but it was chambered for 6mm Caseless. It had a hopper on the side to fit standard Manticore magazines into. It made sense, you didn't want to put a belt link on caseless ammo. The hopper held 6 magazines, for 360 rounds on tap. The hopper could be refilled one at a time, if needed, or the whole hopper could be detached and the weapon reloaded by swapping full hoppers.

K: "Zipp." I pointed to the Machine Gun.

Zipp: "Note: Bigger machine gun." She looked at me, and tilted her head, like, did I get it right?"

I nodded to her in the affirmative, and smiled. She smiled, back, and we bro-hoof'd. We were meshing. Pipp was busy filming at the back of the boat, to keep her audience distracted.

Hitch: "I see you two are getting along good." He nodded, pacing up. "I could use a good detective in Maretime Bay!" He smiled at Zipp.

Zipp: "Oh? Got a problem finding your horseshoes?" She smirked at him, leaning in a bit, raising an eyebrow.

I didn't see it, but Sunny gave a half-glare to the interaction.

I leaned on the machine gun mount as the river boat pulled away from shore. I didn't have my sea legs.

K: "Ahh.. where's Izzy?" I looked around.

Sunny: "Huh?" She looked around. "Oh, no!" She trotted off. "I saw her get on the boat..!"

Zipp: "You know, I hear you're kinda popular." She said to Hitch.

Hitch: "Ehhh.. I've done some modeling." He struck a pose and smiled.

Zipp: "Uh-huh. I might've gotten one of your calendars in the mail." She snickered.

Hitch: "Oh, no! The Bank of Equestria one!" He drooped his head.

Zipp: "Ah, it's chill." She patted his back.

Interesting.. I wasn't entirely sure if they were flirting, or just feeling each other out, but I noted that Zipp was very much a tomboy. Reminded me of J--, honestly, a bit, but not in the same way.

Sunny returned with Izzy in short order, and Izzy was using her Titan's Mitts and walk boots so she could assemble something with her forelimbs while walking. She put together a fascinating decoration. I noted it had glitter in it. She put it on the superstructure near the main hatch to the inside.

Fascinating.

Pipp came back forwards after her update short.

K: "Just asking, Pipp, do you have any military training?" I nodded to her. "You know if you're going to hang with us, it could be dangerous."

Pipp: "Oh! No, no, not really. I did do this FAB show with the Security team, once, though." She smiled. "It was Ahh-MAYYY-ziing!" She sang that last part.

K: "I'm going to tell you right now, music has its own power." I nodded to her. "I'm going to teach you a song." I smiled.

Pipp: "YOU know MUSIC!?" She lit up, her wings extending outwards in excitement.

K: "I do. I know a very special song." I nodded, and hummed up the tune.

K (Singing): "When she was a little filly and the sun was going down..."

Sunny: *Bemused* "Oh, Grandpa isn't going to-"

K (Singing): "The darkness and the shadows, they would always make her frown!"

Hitch: "He is." He grinned, confidently.

K (Singing):

"She'd hide under her pillow

From what she thought she saw

But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way

To deal with fears at all..!"


Zipp: *Confidently* "Then what is?" She grinned at me.


K (Singing):

"She said: "Rosie, you gotta stand up tall

Learn to face your fears

You'll see that they can't hurt you

Just laugh to make them disappear."

K: "Ha! Ha! Ha!"

I pointed out over the water.

Everyone: "Yeah!" They cheered, confidently.


K (Singing):

"So, giggle at the ghostly!

Guffaw at the grossly!

Crack up at the creepy!

Whoop it up with the weepy!

Chortle at the kooky!

Snortle at the spooky!

And tell that big dumb scary face to take a hike and leave you alone and if he thinks he can scare you then he's got another thing coming and the very idea of such a thing just makes you wanna... *Chuckling laughter*

Laaaaaaauuugh!"

Pipp: "OH, MY HOOFNESS! THAT WAS SO AHH-MAAAAAAAAAAAZING!" She sang that last word. "I recorded it! Oh, my HOOFNESS!" She hugged me. "I didn't have ANY idea that YOU could SING!" She smiled.

K: "Eh, well, I have a few talents." I shrugged. "Don't release that until later, though." I nodded.

Pipp: "Hoof to Heart." She nodded, making her vow.

The trip was uneventful. I didn't know for sure, but I had a feeling, the song had something to do with it. Even if standard magic was gone, OTHER magics still existed in some way. Sigil magic, music magic, and friendship magic. It was so very weak, but it was still there. Just a bit.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: At the Heights

TIME: 15:21 NERST
DATE: Redemption Day 9/15 Septimus, 2054 C.S.
LOCATION: Zephyr Heights, Greenbrooke, New Equestria


The offices of the national government were partly located here, as Zipp explained to me, and as most of the city was populated by Pegasi, this is where Haven preferred to stay. Her personal offices were here.

Zipp called her mom before we arrived, and told her she wanted to see her. It'd been a time since she'd seen her mom, so, Haven - I was warned - was going to be very excited to see her and Pipp together.

As we entered the government offices, I was struck by how much it resembled Canterlot. Like, they'd lost Canterlot, and copied a lot of its trappings here. It was... bittersweet at best. I didn't pay that much attention to all of what Zipp was saying as she led us through the building. It functioned as a substitute Royal Palace, Parliament, and where Theia and Haven primarily lived. We finally got to the throne room, where Theia usually held court - and there was Haven.

Zipp: "..and this is my mother, General." She nodded.

Her mother saw me and immediately looked shocked that I even existed.

Haven: "General K!?" She bowed immediately. "My hoofness! I.. I didn't know you'd been resurrected!" She shook her head. "I-I am Prime Minister Haven of New Equestria, serving at the pleasure of Princess Theia.."

K: "..and the Ponies of the Kingdom, now rise. I'm no God, I wasn't resurrected, I'm just here. I'm just a human." I bid her to look at me. "And I'm honored that you have. I've met your daughter." I shrugged. "I have a lot that needs catching up on, but first, I need to see my daughter, Theia." I looked over at the tapestry on the wall.. it depicted me and Dusk, shortly before the final battle with Tirek.

Haven: "It will be my pleasure, General." She bowed a bit to me. "She holds an Itinerant Court, so she can be among the subjects. Let me check the schedule to see where she'd be today, and we can call her." She pulled out her cell phone and proceeded to look it up. "I can't believe you're really here." She shrugged.

Sunny: "It means a lot of changes." She nodded.

Pipp: "HEY! I can DOCUMENT them!" She suddenly realized.

K: "Actually, I want you to be my War Reporter, Pipp." I looked over at her, having finally made the decision. "But, modern styled." I pointed at her. "No turning that camera on unless I say so, though."

Pipp: "OH! Oh, okay." She blinked a few times at me.

Haven: "She would be in the village of Rockfall this afternoon. It's not terribly far, but.." She shrugged.

K: "It's not like she can teleport back." I shrugged. "No rail line out there?"

Haven: "No.. ah.. I don't know how much you know of this future.." She trailed off.

K: "I get it. It's fine." I shrugged.

Haven: "We.." She paused a bit, and nodded to Sunny. "There were a lot of us who'd given up hope that you'd ever return. I admit that I was one of them." She shrugged her shoulders and wings. "I thought that you were truly dead."

K: "No, no.. just.. sent back to my own time and world." I gestured. "It was Discord that originally brought me here, you know."

Haven: "Then.. how are you here, now?" She furrowed her brow. "The amount of magic that would take.."

K: "I have no idea. Last time I was here, I was pretty sure, the whole time, if I did die, it would just send me back to my world. This time? I haven't a clue. I could really-really be here, as in, this is it. No second chances. No going back to Earth. I conducted myself with an almost reckless abandon, after a while, last time, because I knew the ponies under me could win the war if I died and was sent back.. and knowing that I would be. I didn't have to fear death."

Haven: "..and now?" She asked with a note of hopelessness.

K: "I literally have nothing to live for. I'm an old man. I'm out of shape. I have no human family left in my old world. If this is the end for me, I have zero regrets if I die here. For distinctly different reasons - once I'm in better shape for my ass to cash the checks my mouth writes - I'm going to behave the same way. Especially.." I nodded to Hitch, Izzy, Sunny, Zipp, and Pipp. "..once I train a new CAG."

Haven: "So.." She smiled, warmly. "..we really are saved. This isn't a false coming. And.. you're going to be the General K your legends say you were."

K: "I'm just one lone human, Haven." I put a hand on her shoulder, reassuringly. "All I can do is give YOU ponies the tools to make things happen, and save yourselves. I did that last time. I'll do it this time. YOU ponies won that war. I just helped. I'm no scion, no Messiah. I'm just a friend. But be assured that, no matter what, I am absolutely willing to die here, to save all of you."

Haven: "WONDERFUL news." She smiled, as a white puff trotted up, and borked at me. "Oh, Cloudpuff! This is K!" She picked him up.

I accepted the offered fluff, and gave him a hug. He was soft, warm, and comfortable. He licked my face in acceptance. And barked, jumping from my arms, and trotting over to see Pipp and Zipp.

K: "You realize, Haven.. I need both your daughters." I shrugged.

Haven: "..." She paused, at the realization. "..they'll be in danger."

K: "Yes." I nodded. "I mean.. we're going to all be in danger to fix everything."

Haven: "..we've been so passive for so long, though.." She trailed off. "..and while things haven't been perfect, they've been pretty safe." She looked at her girls. "I.."

Zipp: "Mom." She nodded to her. "I mean it. I want to go with K." She looked at Pipp. "And I want my sister at my side."

Pipp: "Really!?" She jumped a bit.

Zipp: "Yeah.. I mean.. come on. We're sisters." She shrugged. "I need my co-conspirator. My partner in crime." She grinned a bit.

Pipp: "Then I wanna be right with you!" She slid a foreleg around her sister's neck. "It's gonna be absolutely FAB! Like, WE are going to SAVE the Wooooooorld!" She sang that last word.

K: "We will." I said, looking at Haven.

Haven: "It's.." She looked down, but up. "..something I feared for so long, but..." She sighed. "I can't exactly stop you. Any of you." She went over and hugged her daughters. "My girls! I love you so much. Now, no matter how much you need to go out there and save the world, I want to hear from you EVERY. DAY. Understand? And, Zephyrina-"

Zipp: "-Zipp, Mom-"

Haven: "-I want you to learn as much as possible from K." She nodded. "He did a lot, a thousand years ago. He STARTED this government - he's the reason I have the title I do, and our family has served the Kingdom the way we have for nearly 300 years."

Zipp: *Slightly annoyed, but affectionately* "Yes, Mom.." She smiled, but sighed.

Haven: "And if you need anything, CALL me." She stated firmly.

Zipp: "I will, Mom." She nodded. "I.. I love you, Mom." She hugged her again.

Haven: "I love both of you so much." She hugged them tightly.

K: "Haven." I nodded to her.

Haven: "Yes, General?" She said, sniffing, and turning to look at me.

K: "Just K." I shook my head. "We should be friends." I nodded. "And as friends, we use names, not titles."

Haven: "Of course, K." She smiled at me, and offered her hoof.

I hugged her, instead. A friendly hug, but a hug she didn't expect. She hugged back.

K: "Now, tell me.. I need to know, if you know, what happened to all the magic?" I nodded to her.

Sunny: "I can.. answer.. part of that." She shrugged. "Ma'am." She introduced herself. "Lieutenant Sunrise Magic Starscout. Maretime Bay Militia, Ordinance. K is my grandfather." She slid Izzy over, who was busy examining all the tapestries in the room. "This is Izzy Moonbow."

Izzy: "Hiya, ma'am!" She cheered. "I loooove this place! I've never been outside of Bridlewood before? You know? And this is so amazing, all the things that you have here, and all this wonderful art and-" She cut herself off. "-wooooow!" She pointed to Haven's head dress.

Hitch: "Ah, I'm Sheriff Hitch of Maretime Bay, Ma'am." He nodded to her.

Haven: "A pleasure to meet you all!" She smiled. "My daughters' friends.. I'm so happy you two have some real friends, now." She looked at her girls.

Sunny: "Anyway.. as the story goes, a thousand years ago, the kingdoms were attacked by something - we now know they were shadow creatures, based on what Major General Moon Flower said to us. And it happened very quickly, several days and no more than that. The Alicorns gathered and did.. something... we don't know what. They took all the magic in Equestria.. and sealed it." She shrugged. "Ever since then, Magic has been gone. Pegasi can't fly, and Unicorns can't cast spells.. friendships have slowly started to erode.. even the friendships between the races have started to get bad." She implored Haven. "Please, ma'am - tell me you've noticed?"

Haven: "I have." She nodded. "I know a bit more than that, as well." She took her head dress off, and handed it to me. "The magic was sealed into the Unity Crystal. And that crystal was divided between three of the kingdom's most trusted ponies that still remained. I'm not certain how, but this has been in our family for about three hundred years. Bridlewood would have another crystal, I'm sure, since mostly Unicorns live there. I'm.. not sure where the Earth Pony crystal would be."

Sunny: "There's an Earth Pony crystal?" She seemed surprised.

Haven: "Of course, my child!" She smiled. "All three races have a bit of their own magic."

K: "I noted that Earth Ponies back a thousand years ago were physically stronger and more capable on the ground than Pegasi and Unicorns, by and large." I nodded. "My brother-in-law, Big Mac, was a perfect example." I shrugged.

Sunny: "So.. if we want to restore the magic, we need to find the other two crystals." She tapped her hoof to her chin.

Haven: "It's more than that - you have to unite them at the right place." She shrugged.

Sunny: "I see." She nodded.

K: "And that will restore magic?" I tilted my head.

Sunny: "Yeah, it should." She shrugged.

K: "That's the first step to restoring this world." I nodded firmly. "I want to know why my two friends, Twilight Sparkle and Sunset Spruce, would decide to split magic like that. And I need to know what this threat is really called." I shook my head. "But, restoring magic is our first mission." I looked at my five friends. "Right, team?"

All: "RIGHT!"

Pipp: "SO right!" She smiled.

K: "That and I want to talk to Theia." I nodded. "I want to see my daughter."

Haven: "I'll call her - she could be back by as soon as tomorrow morning." She smiled. "K.. I'm.. I'm afraid for my girls, but.." She looked out the window. "..we need to fix this world, even I know that." She nodded, and sighed. "I know you can do this."

K: "We, Haven." I nodded. "We. You ponies did it last time, I just helped."

Haven: "We." She smiled warmly. "If I ever had a son, I would have wanted him to be as brave as you."

I had no idea what that would mean in the future, but I knew that we now had a mission. Restore the Unity Crystal, and return Magic to New Equestria. Give the Ponies back their ability to fight against the shadows.

With friends, we could do anything. Because Friendship is Magic.
