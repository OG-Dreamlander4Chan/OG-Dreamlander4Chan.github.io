Part 1: Shaking the Earth

TIME: 08:20 ERDT
DATE: War Day 546/5 Decemus, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Fillydelphia Naval Yards, Fillydelphia, Docksylvania

Dex Runner and I were.. actually on the beach, facing the harbor. Vy and Applejack were down towards the water line, with some of the kids. It was warm for early fall.

Because we're all soldiers, and this IS a war, our rifles were in a Stack not far from us. I was reclined, actually, and both Dex and I were wearing shorts. To be fair, that's all Dex was wearing. I had a tanktop on.

Dex: "Such a nice day, K-Dude." And sunglasses.

K: "Probably the last warm day of the year. I mean, we don't know how many chances we'll get to relax between now and the next big fight." I nodded. "Fleet'll be leaving tomorrow."

Dex: "Yup. Have fun, yeah?" He grinned a little.

K: "Uh-huh. No getting married until I get back." I smirked.

Dex: *COUGH!* "EH!?" He rolled over in his beach chair to look right at me.

K: "Come on. We've all known you two are an item for ages." I shrugged. "You make great music together. And I want you two to be happy." I nodded.

Dex: "Uhm.." He was blushing. "..actually, could you come to the club, tonight?" He gave me a glance. "I need a wingman."

K: "Any time, Dex." I gave him a very happy grin.

I got up and stretched a bit. Walking over to the cooler, I plucked out a drink, and shoo'd away a sand crab that was trying to get inside. Bottled apple cider, non-alcoholic. Actually, we didn't bring any alcohol on the trip - since Dex and Vy were both working tonight, they needed to be sober. I had a staff meeting later, never mind the fact that I don't drink.

I looked at HMS Moonlight, which would serve again as my flagship for the journey over to Neighpon. Which should take no more than ten days, now that we had an all-steam fleet. HMS Alarm was at the dock, nearby, just loading up with her final supplies.

The initial fleet would consist of the Battleship HMS Luna, the Moonlight, the Canterlot-class Armored Cruiser Docksylvania, the City-class Protected Scout Cruisers Fillydelphia and Detrot, the Bellerophon-class Frigates Unicorn and Crystal, and the Alpha-Class Corvettes Alarm, Alacrity, and Adroit. Besides Alarm, Unicorn, and Moonlight, these ships were either on their virgin or shakedown cruises. I didn't have a choice in the matter.

Following up in ten days, with troop transports, would be the Battleship HMS Celestia, Armored Cruiser Greenbroke (Equestria's equivalent to Vermont), Scout Cruiser Martingalier (Montpelier), Frigates Pegasus and Terra, and Corvettes Advance, Aware, Adept, and Adventure. All remaining vessels would be working up off Baleston and Fillydelphia.

Also, I didn't have Saletine to command the task force. He was Admiral, now, and senior officer of the navy.

Instead, I had Commodore Whitecap.

I could see Deep Blue and Sea Swirl on Alarm, issuing orders. Deep Blue waved to me, and I waved back.

K: "BOTH OF YOU, MAKE TIME TO COME TO THE CLUB TONIGHT!" I yelled at the top of my lungs.

She nodded and waved back.

Then, I saw the flicker...

K: "COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!"

She looked at me, looked back towards the horizon, down to her crew, yelled, and dove down inside the bridge.

The screech of incoming artillery reached my ears at the same moment as the concussive echo of cannon fire.

An instant later, three explosions rocked the dock next to Alarm. Huge ones. The ejecta wave tossed the ship clear of its moorings, and nearly capsized it.

I was hastily getting my boots on as Dex handed me my Bradley. Vy and Applejack were getting the kids away from the beach, and were almost back to us. The city alarm was just now ringing.

K: "Come on, Dex!" I took the rifle and pointed at HMS Alarm.

Dex: "Just a sec!" He stopped Vy in her tracks. "Hey, listen, this isn't how I wanted this to go, but before I go out there, I gotta hear it." He dug in his pocket a moment, and brought out a ring box, which he opened. "Vy. You be my co-EmCee, for, like, forever?"

Vinyl Scratch: "Damn straight I will." She took the ring from him, kissed him hard, and pushed him to me. "You bring him back alive!"

K: "I'll try." I got a kiss from Applejack at that same moment.

Applejack: "We'll get the civilians away fr'm th' shore! C'mon, Vy! We got work t'do!" She scooped up the kids, and took off with her.

K: "Not what you wanted." I shrugged. "Better'n nothin!"

Dex: "Fer sher! Come on!" He galloped ahead of me.

I could hear more artillery shells incoming from the ocean. I was running towards Alarm, who was working up steam. I ended up climbing on the broken dock, with Dex, and jumping on to Alarm's deck.

Once again, Tirek pre-empted me. There was a spy about. I'd find them, and I'd kill them.

Part 2: Naval Battle of Fillydelphia

TIME: 08:41 ERDT
DATE: War Day 546/5 Decemus, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Aboard HMS Alarm, Fillydelphia Harbor

K: "DEEP! STATUS REPORT!" I rushed to the bridge, with Dex behind me.

Deep Blue: "We're fine! Boilers are online and we're making steam - we don't have a tug." She shrugged. "ALL BACK FULL!" She nodded to the radio. "Welcome to your flagship." She gave me a cruel smirk - Tirek's forces would pay.

K: C> "This is General K, aboard HMS Alarm! All ships available, make steam, and get out of the harbor! Form up on Alarm and prepare to counter-attack!" I changed channels. "Fillydelphia Naval Air Station, come in!"

Fillydelphia NAS: C> "We read you, General! We're already responding! They came out of the east at high speed! The enemy consists of three battleships, three ocean-going monitors, three cruisers, and five destroyers. They cut engines and made sail the last ten or so miles - we didn't spot their smoke. All enemy ships are ironclads with sail masts. Over!"

K: C> "Roger that, Fillydelphia. Good report! Now, bomb those things! K, out." I switched back to the Naval channel. "All ships responding, report in!"

HMS Luna: C> "This is Luna, we're hit! Forward battery out of action! We're making steam, now, but we've taken several hits. Aft batteries are functional, we'll form up in ten minutes!"

HMS Detrot: C> "This is Detrot! We've taken serious damage! Captain has called for abandon ship!"

HMS Moonlight: C> "This is Commodore Whitecap on Moonlight. We haven't taken any hits, we're already at full steam, and ready to form up, General."

HMS Adroit: C> "HMS Adroit reporting. Full steam, and forming up now."

HMS Las Pegasus: C> "This is Las Pegasus, we're already firing on enemy vessels! Coming out of the dockway now! We're at your rear, General!"

HMS Neighvada: C> "This is Neghvada! We've taken two minor hits to the stern, but are making steam on six boilers! Our speed is at half, but we're responding. Forming up in five minutes."

HMS Shining Armor: C> "This is Shining Armor with Maresechusetts, Hosston, and Daedalus! We were coming down from Baleston Naval Yards - ETA ten minutes! Forward lookouts can see the enemy vessels, but we're out of range."

HMS Bellerophon: C> "YAR-HAR MATEYS! DID YE FERGET OL' ADMIRAL SALETINE?! I'm aboard Bellerophon! We're at yer rear, General! Say the word, me hearties!"

K: C> "Moonlight, Las Pegasus, Bellerophon, Adroit, form up on me. Adroit, Alarm, and Bellerophon will cut in for torpedo attack, Cutting-C formation. Moonlight, Las Pegasus, provide gunfire cover. We're going for the lead battleship." I nodded to Deep Blue. "Get us close, and prepare to launch torpedoes, full spread."

Deep Blue: "Aye-aye! Helm, come to heading 2-1-0. Engines all ahead flank. Torpedo Control, prepare to fire full spread, starboard bow."

K: C> "Shining Armor, your task force will attack the rear of the enemy formation. When you get near range, make a rake maneuver turn, and have Daedalus and Baleston cut in close, while you and Maresechusetts form a second line behind them. Cross their T at the rear. My task force will engage from their starboard side."

HMS Shining Armor: "Shining Armor acknowledges!"

Deep Blue: "TORPEDOES AWAY!" She called out, as we got within range of the lead enemy vessel. "HELM, HARD A'PORT! MAIN GUNS, FIRE!"

I watched the forward 95mm gun bark towards the lead battleship, and the battleship start to traverse its guns towards us. At the same time, our torpedoes were sliding right for it, and it wasn't making a turn.

Sea Swirl: "Torpedo impact in three.. two.. one!"

I saw five large detonations below the waterline on the enemy battleship, and gouts of flame shoot upwards. A moment later, the forward magazine detonated, and the enemy battleship's "A" turret was launched into the air, crashing down on the "B" turret and crushing it down to the barbette.

Behind us, Adroit made its torpedo run, and I could see the wakes of its torpedoes as we pulled away. Four more detonations, and the enemy battleship started listing heavily to the side. It was out of action. And moreover, it now interrupted the battle line, with the second battleship in line having to steer sea-side to avoid it, and the third battleship having to begin a turn to lead the rest of the heavy guns away from the skinking vessel.

K: C> "Saletine! GET THAT SECOND BATTLESHIP!" I called.

Saletine: C> "YAR! Bellerophon acknowledges!"

I watched Bellerophon adjust its turn, and now behind Adroit, come fully broadside to the second battleship, and fire all three of its torpedo launchers, while turning to keep to the starboard quarter of Adroit.

Luna was now clear of the harbor with Neighvada. With her damaged forward guns, she was having to turn sharply and present broadside to the enemy vessels, which made her a hell of a target. Her forward "A" and "B" turrets had smoking holes in them, but I could see ponies hosing them down to prevent fires. Her "C" and "D" forward 8-inch gun turrets seemed to be okay, in as much as "C" turret was firing on the second battleship along with her "X" and "Y" 12-inch gun turrets.

Neighvada was taking a protecting position to Luna's starboard bow, covering her lost turrets and damaged hull. Neighvada was firing on the first Monitor in the line, and was scoring some good hits from what I could see.

K: "This isn't exactly a proper fleet engagement.." I frowned. "..time to reload the torpedo launchers?"

Deep Blue: "Already done. Torpedoes armed and ready."

K: C> "Adroit, Bellerophon, follow me. We're going to skim some heavies. Alarm will drop her first set of fish on the lead Monitor, then Adroit on the second, and Bellerophon on the third. Alarm gets the lead cruiser, Adroit gets the second, and Bellerophon gets the third. When the destroyers come up on us, Bellerophon fires her third launcher at them in a wide spread, make them scatter. Alarm and Adroit should be out of torpedoes at that point. We'll cut in on the enemy destroyers - Adroit and Alarm on one target, Bellerophon keeps the others off our backs!"

Saletine: C> "AYE-AYE, MY GENERAL!" He roared into the mic.

K: "I think he's enjoying this." I smirked.

Deep Blue: "Glad someone is."

A near miss on Alarm sent us lurching, and shattered the glass on the port side of the bridge. A pony standing there on lookout fell to the ground with glass all over their face.

K: C> "Pharmacist's Mate to the bridge!" I called that on the ship's sound-powered phone. "Get ready."

Deep Blue: "Helm, start your turn." She directed.

K: C> "Alarm to Shining Armor. We're going to skim the heavies with torpedoes and then catch them between us. Send Daedalus ahead when the destroyers break from the rear of the formation. Daedalus teams up with Bellerophon, and occupies the enemy destroyers while Adroit and Alarm focus fire on one at a time. Your formation should start focusing on the Cruisers at the back of the enemy line when we do so. Luna, Moonlight, Las Pegasus, focus on the enemy Battleships. We've got one down, one damaged." I glanced back at the docks.

HMS Shining Armor: C> "Shining Armor acknowledges."

HMS Moonlight: C> "Moonlight, Aye-Aye, General."

K: C> "Alarm to HMS Celestia. Where ARE you?"

HMS Celestia: C> "We're just getting steam up now, General. ETA is five minutes."

K: C> "Alarm to Docksylvania - report status."

HMS Docksylvania: C> "General, our engines were dead cold when the attack happened! It'll be another twenty minutes until we can get some steam pressure up. Sorry, General."

K: C> "Alarm to any other Alpha-type Corvette. Report in."

There was a pause.. there shouldn't've been.

HMS Adventure: C> "This is Adventure, with Aware, Alacrity, and Advance.. uh.. well.. we had an argument about what to do. We're twelve nautical miles down the coast and making full speed. Fifteen minutes, General."

K: C> "We'll address that later. When your formation arrives, if there's anything left, focus torpedo attacks on the ships furthest south-west."

Deep Blue: "Had an argument..?" She furrowed her brow at me.

K: "I'm betting they argued first about who's in charge, then about whether to run or fight. We'll sort that out later. We're almost in position for our attack run." I pointed through the shell spray ahead.

Deep Blue: "TORPEDO LAUNCHER NUMBER ONE! PREPARE TO FIRE! HELM, BREAK OFF! LAUNCHER... FIRE!"

K: C> "Alarm, we're making our run! Adroit, get ready!"

Sea Swirl: "Torpedoes fired.. eight seconds to impact."

Deep Blue: "Helm, get u-"

*WHATAAAAAAAAMM!!!*

We were rocked by that hit, and I could feel the whole ship lurch. It wasn't one of the larger caliber shells, or I wouldn't've been alive to think in the first place. I scrambled to my feet. Smoke and the sound of bouncing metal ricochets filled my ears.

K: "Deep! Sea!" I staggered over to the captain's seat, and found her on the floor. "Sea!" She was out cold. "EVERYONE! GET UP!"

Dex: "DUDE!" A groan. "I got the helm, General!" He paused. "Dude, we're out of position! We're aimed at the enemy vessel! We're CLOSE..!"

I reached for the sound-powered phone.

K: "Execute our turn as planned!" C> "Pharmacist's Mate and Damage Control - to the bridge! We're hit!"

Damage Control Officer: C> "Hit on the starboad side, by the bridge! Damage to electrical, but we're still moving!"

K: C> "Understood - do what you can!" I looked around for Sea Swirl, and saw her staggering to her feet. "Time to impact!"

Sea Swirl looked at her stopwatch, and held it up to me. It was shattered, with a piece of shrapnel jammed in it.

I looked towards our target, and could see the after-effects of three geysers by the midsection, and all the smoke from the enemy's smokestack suddenly stop.

Water in the engine room.

K: C> "That monitor's gonna blow! BRACE FOR IMPACT!" We were too close..

When it did, it felt like a volcano erupted right next to us. All the boilers on the enemy Monitor detonated when the cold sea water hit them. Thermal expansion is a bitch. That lit off both ammunition magazines. Everything went up all at once.

Alarm lurched in the water, everyone was thrown to the deck, and I slammed in to the radio set.

K: C> "BELLEROPHON, IF YOU GET THIS, I'M PASSING MY FLAG! ALARM IS DISABLED!" I screamed into the mic, hoping it was still sending a signal.

Everything rocked and rolled as the Monitor's secondary magazines went up. I remember darkness, and my head hitting something.

Then, nothing.

Part 3: Invasionus Interruptus

TIME: 05:37
DATE: War Day 547/6 Decemus, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Fillydelphia Naval Hospital, Fillydelphia, Docksylvania

I sat straight up in bed. I was alone in a room. Again. I felt myself all over and realized I had bandages on my chest. Again. I looked at my arms, felt my head and the bandage there. And scampered out of bed.

Cold floor! COLD FLOOR!

I staggered around to the foot of the bed.. and there was a BIG pink "Get Well Soon" card on it.

I sighed in unbelieveable relief. For a few moments, I seriously thought everything had just been a dream, and I'd wake back up in the Herdiet Union.

So, I got to the door, and opened it. No one outside, but I could hear the sounds of the hospital in operation, and in Equestrian.

K: "HEY! I'M AWAKE IN HERE!" I coughed. "AND THIS FLOOR IS COLD! SOMEONE BRING YOUR GENERAL SOME SLIPPERS OR SOMETHING!?"

Twilight: "K! K!" She came running up the hall with Spike. "Oh, thank Celestia!" She hugged me, Spike hugged me, and up behind her came Dr. Well Wishes and Dr. Allcome.

Well Wishes: "Gah-hah! There! See? Didn't I tell you? Our resident War Monger is JUST fine!" He snorted a bit, and adjusted his tie.

Fluttershy: "You were the first one there to drag him off the ship.." She said, coming up behind him.

Well Wishes: "It's not like I was concerned about him!" He got stuffy with her.

Fluttershy: "You called him by his full name, and told him to hang on." She smirked a tiny bit.

Well Wishes: "It's not like I cared or anything!" He recoiled a tiny bit.

Fluttershy: "You told him not to die.. you said you couldn't bear to lose a fr-"

Well Wishes: "That's quite enough!" He was flustered and blushing.

K: "Doc." I patted his head. "Cody." I nodded to Allcome.

Dr. Allcome: "Your surgery was a success. And it's a good thing, too. Miss Deep Blue wanted to thank you for covering her with your body."

K: "I did?" I shrugged. "I don't much remember. Where's Saletine?"

Applejack: "HONEYBUN!" She zoomed in between everyone, hugged me, and DRAGGED me back to the bed. "Oh, thank CELESTIA!"

K: "OKAY! Okay.. ach.. ow.. okay, that hurts." I hugged her. "Where's Dex.. where's Sea Swirl.. someone give me a casualty report!" I was being smooched by Applejack.

Twilight: "Dex was hurt, but he's okay. Deep and Sea Swirl are both alive and in the hospital." She paused. "The.. uh.. the Bellerophon went down with all hands.. K.." She lowered her head.

K: "Wh.." I grabbed Applejack and held her away from me. "..Saletine?"

Twilight: "Rammed the third monitor after they took a major hit to the aft of the ship that blew up their torpedo launchers.. they were going down anyway.. he.." She sniffled.

Commodore Whitecap came in right about then, and bowed to me.

Whitecap: "General." She held out the sword that I'd given Saletine, over a year ago.

K: "Whitecap." I nodded. "Losses."

Whitecap: "Detrot, Bellerophon, Alarm, Adroit, all sunk. Luna is severely damaged - she took several more hits. Starboard center casemate completely blown out, two boilers ruptured. Neighvada took several hits meant for Luna, rear guns destroyed. Las Pegasus lost her bridge and senior officers. Baleston and Maresechusetts took a few hits when they came in for support. Shining Armor took one torpedo to the bow, but it failed to detonate. Celestia took no damage. The Alpha-class corvettes that came from the south were late, and didn't get there until the battle was over."

K: "Whitecap." I nodded and pushed the sword back into her hooves. "You must've done a fantastic job, or I wouldn't be here. I promote you to Senior Officer of the Navy, as full Admiral."

Whitecap: "..I don't know if I deserve this, General.." She lowered her head. "I feel more like I failed."

K: "Because you lost your mentor, and our friends." I shrugged. "They bushwhacked us. Given the situation, we didn't lose any Capital Ships, that's a damn miracle. Enemy casualties?" I asked, letting Applejack cuddle me.

Whitecap: "All three enemy battleships sunk. All three monitors, sunk. Two destroyers sunk, one cruiser sunk. The rest retreated. Given our situation, I didn't offer a lengthy pursuit." She shrugged.

K: "Good. Very good." I nodded. "Did Saletine have any family?"

Whitecap: "Actually.. no.. sir, he didn't." She shrugged, glumly. "He was all alone."

Applejack: "Not by a durn sight, he wasn't!" She lifted her head. "He was OUR family! OUR kin!" She thumped her hoof into the mattress, tears coming down either side of her snout.

K: "Jackie.." I pet her mane.

Twilight: "It's just NOT FAIR!" She finally broke. "We lost so many FRIENDS! And.. and Saletine! He.." She started tearing up, and just sat down.

That's when Luna came in.. it was getting awful late for her.

Luna: "My General." She came over and nuzzled me. "Indeed. He was not alone. He was one of the Moon's.." She looked out the window a moment. "..mates." A small smirk.

K: "Yeah. May as well give him that. He gave you a ship. All I gave you was a daughter, and that came later." I smiled a little, as Starlight Mint carefully dismounted Mommy and got into bed with me.

Mind, Florale was at my feet already.

Luna: "Look." She nodded out the window.

Sure enough, I could see a small star in the night, shining down on us. Knowing the processes of stellar birth and astronomy, I did find it a bit odd that I could see it. Granted, sun-up wasn't for another hour and a half, but, still..

K: "You made him a Star.." I trailed off.

Luna: "More that we've named it for him." She smiled a little.

K: "I hope it isn't populated with a species of hostile aliens by the time Ponynauts get there." I smirked.

Luna: "We'll find out some day." She shrugged. "It could be all alone, for all we know. No planets."

Dr. Allcome: "I do hate to interrupt this love fest, everyone, but K needs his rest." He cleared his throat. "Breakfast in about an hour, K, if you're awake for it."

K: "Thanks, Cody." I nodded.

So, my battle had been a dearly-won victory. I cost Tirek six Capital Ships, and three more besides. It cost me a cruiser, a frigate - my first - and two Corvettes, plus damages, and my Senior Officer.

Saletine would have called this a good trade.

I wasn't so sure. Trading friends for victory was something that never sat right with me. I suppose that's what kept me going - trying to make sure everyone came back.

Part 4: Alpha Fallout

TIME: 15:13
DATE: War Day 548/7 Decemus, Decemus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Fillydelphia Naval Yards HQ building, Fillydelphia, Docksylvania

Myself, Admiral Whitecap, and Commandant Forest Spirit, were seated.. and we stared at the ponies in front of us. I raised the gavel.

K: "This General Court Martial will come to order." I banged the gavel on the desk. "Commander White Jetspray, Commander Rainbow Seaflower, Commander Green Sea, and Lieutenant-Commander Ochre Wave, you are accused by this Court Martial of cowardice, dereliction of duty, conduct unbecoming of an officer of the Royal Navy, and disobeying the orders of a senior officer - that as a result of these charges, your fellow officers and sailors were killed in action. How do you each plead?"

Jetspray: "Not guilty!"

Seaflower: "Not guilty!" She almost spat that at me.

Green Sea: "Not guily, General." He looked down.

Ochre Wave paused, and looked at his fellow officers, then to me.

Ochre Wave: "I plead guilty as charged, General." He looked me right in the eye.

Seaflower: "OCHRE!" She about swung on him, but the Bailiff restrained her.

K: "ORDER!" I banged the gavel again. "Lieutenant-Commander Ochre Wave, you understand that by pleading guilty to these crimes, you waive any right to appeal your punishment?" I looked at him.

Ochre Wave: "I do, General." He nodded. "I am prepared to face any punishment this Court Martial sees fit to give me."

Jetspray hissed a little under her breath.

K: "Then this court will hear out, in your own words, why you believe you're guilty."

Ochre Wave: "Permission to speak freely, sirs?" He looked at Admiral Whitecap, myself, and Commodore Sargasso Sea.

Adm. Whitecap: "Granted."

Ochre Wave: "I accept all blame that is mine to have. When the attack began, I panicked. I was afraid. Not only for my own life, but for my ship - I had no confidence in our ability to fight. We had just begun our training exercise south of Fillydelphia when the attack began. My first instinct was to head further south to the next port, and.. hide. When General K called to form up and prepare for battle, I balked. I didn't allow our radiopony to respond to his call. I stated that it was Fillydelphia's problem, whatever it was." He looked down.

K: "I see. You confess to cowardice?"

Ochre Wave: "I do, sir."

K: "Continue." I nodded to him.

Ochre Wave: "The other ships.. Advance, Aware, and Adventure.. they didn't respond, either. As junior officer commanding, I was looking to them for leadership, though as Ship's Captain, I should have provided that to my own crew." He looked at the other officers.

They looked ready to murder him.

K: "You then confess to conduct unbecoming an officer of the Royal Navy?" I tilted my head.

Ochre Wave: "I do, sir." He nodded again.

K: "Continue your testimony." I nodded back.

Ochre Wave: "When you later specifically called for all Alpha-class Corvettes in range to respond, I.." He looked at Jetspray. "..waited to see who'd speak first. We had started arguing over the radio about both what to do, and who was in command. Commander Jetspray had been put in charge of the training mission, but Commander Seaflower stated that she'd been ranked Commander longer, and Commander Green Sea.." He shook his head. "..pointed out that his sister was commander of the flagship."

I looked at Sargasso Sea. She shook her head in shame.

K: "There was an argument about who should be in command, is that what you're saying?"

Ochre Wave: "Indeed, sir. At that point, I refused to head to the battle. Not alone, sir."

K: "You confess, then, to disobeying my direct orders?" I leaned my head in at him a bit.

Ochre Wave: "I do, General." He blinked a little.

K: "And that would be a dereliction of duty - do you confess to that as well?" I asked.

Ochre Wave: "I do, General." He looked up at me.

K: "Then, it is the finding of this Court Martial that you are indeed guilty of all charges. The fact that you would confess your guilt, and not ask for mercy, speaks to the strength of your moral character. You may have shown cowardice before, but you show nothing but the highest level of courage, today. However, your punishment must still proceed. You are hereby stripped of all rank and priviledge, reduced to the rank of SeaPony, and dishonorably discharged from the Royal Navy of Princess Celestia and Equestria." I nodded to him.

He removed his entire uniform, folded it, and laid it right in front of the bench, his hat carefully placed on top.

Ochre Wave: "General." He bowed his head. "I have much to atone for. I request permission to join the Royal Marines. As an enlisted pony. Sir."

I looked at Forest Spirit.

Forest Spirit: "Request granted. Report to Stable Island at the conclusion of this Court Martial, to begin boot camp." He raised himself up a bit. "Understand that with this conviction, you'll never rise above the rank of Lance Corporal."

Ochre Wave: "I deserve that and worse, Commandant." He saluted him.

K: "Marine Recruit Ochre Wave, you may have a seat in the Gallery while we conduct the rest of this Court Martial." I nodded.

Ochre Wave: "Aye-Aye, General." He smartly turned, and walked to the front row of the Gallery, behind the Prosecutor's table, and sat down.

The court case rocked Equestria. Four senior Navy officers up on charges. One confessing to everything, and thereby, assuring the conviction of his fellow officers. Nothing like this had happened during the course of the war. Nopony had ever balked at my orders like this. And given their close range to the battle, it would have been an entirely different outcome, had they rushed to assist immediately.

In short, these four officers directly bore the blame for the deaths of so many others. At least, that's how some had started to see it. It was imperitive that it be clear that such behavior not be tolerated, or other ponies might, at critical moments, also abrogate their responsibilities. Hundreds more might die.

After a four day trial, however, it was all over.

K: "Defendants, please rise." I ordered.

The three remaining officers stood up.

K: "It is the finding of this General Court Martial, that all three remaining defendants, Commanders White Jetspray, Rainbow Seaflower, and Green Sea, are guilty of all charges proffered against them. This Court Martial sentences the three defendants as follows: You are hereby stripped of all rank and priviledge, reduced to the rank of Prisoner, and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment at hard labor at Fort Leatherworth Military Correctional Facility, with no possibility of parole. Upon completion of your sentence, you will be dishonorably discharged from the Royal Navy of Princess Celestia and Equestria. May this black mark of shame follow you the rest of your days. Because of your inaction and bickering, hundreds died, including the Senior Officer of the Navy, Admiral Saletine. While this court understands fully that this nation was never meant to fight a war of this magnitude, the fact that none of the three of you would then accept your mistakes and offer restitution, atonement, or apology, speaks to your lack of moral character - a far greater social sin in our culture. This court is adjourned."

I banged the gavel.

There was much outrage from the defendants.

The Gallery erupted in a mixture of disbelief, and rejoicing that someone had been called to account.

I just sat there, watching them be dragged away by the Marine Security Guards, yelling at me, their words drown out by the crowd.

Celestia told me to go through with it. She said this would be messy. Messy wasn't the word - this was downright depressing. But, it was clear that their inaction and lies cost us dearly. Had they responded immediately, they could have arrived within minutes of the attack, formed up with Alarm, and helped us defeat those battleships.

Instead, they cowered, bickered, and showed everything BUT the power of Friendship.

There was no magic here, today.

But there was Justice.

I intercepted Dex as he was wheeling himself out of the hospital building, with Vy right behind him. Forest and Whitecap were both with me. We were still in our formal uniforms.

K: "Captain Dex Runner of the Paddock County Rangers. It is the finding of the General Court Martial that you acted with singular courage and bravery during the attack on Fillydelphia, taking on duties and responsibilites above and beyond the call. As such, the court has suggested, and I have accepted, the suggestion to appoint you to the rank of Major, and award you the Silver Horseshoe." I leaned in and pinned the medal to his shirt, and handed him his new rank pins in a small case.

Dex: "Dude.." He croaked a little, coughed, and shook his head. "..I didn't do it for medals or promotions, General-Dude. I did it because people needed help."

K: "I know. And three senior officers of superior rank to you, abandoned that ideal, and that led to a lot of pain." I shrugged, finding it hard to fight the tears. "They told me you were the one that pulled me off of the bridge, and you kept me afloat until help arrived. You saved my life, Dex." I leaned in and hugged him.

Dex: "..you'd've done the same for me, right?" He hugged back.

K: "You know it, buddy." I leaned back and gave him a beaming grin, tears still coming down my cheeks.

Vinyl Scratch: "Doc Well Wishes says he'll be fit for duty in a couple weeks." She shrugged, then came in and hugged me, too. "Here I thought you'd be the one bringing -him- back.."

Dex: "General-Dude.. be my best man?" He asked.

K: "Always. Any time." I nodded.

Whitecap: "The Royal Navy would also like to extend its thanks to the Paddock County Militia for temporarily affording us its finest officer." She nodded to him, her own face showing a lot of emotion. "You did save a lot of people when Alarm went down."

Dex: "Just doin' my job, Admiral." He smirked. "Call the Rangers any time."

I caught sight of Sargasso Sea, about then. She was heading into the hospital.

K: "Hey, guys, I'll catch you later, okay?" I gave Dex a bro-hoof, and got up, following her.

I intercepted her a few minutes later when she got outside of Deep Blue and Sea Swirl's room.

K: "Commodore.." I started.

Sargasso: "General." She said, numbly.

K: "I'm sorry about your brother." I shrugged.

Sargasso: "I suppose it's my fault, you know?" She looked at me, tears streaming down her own face - but these weren't tears of joy, these were tears of sorrow and shame. "I pushed him.. to.. join, you know? He's my younger brother. I thought.. if.. we got assigned together, or close, I could keep an eye on him. Make sure he came back from the war alive." She shook her head. "I have no idea what I'm going to tell mom." She wrung her hooves in front of herself. "I should have known better! What kind of Big Sister am I, that I.. I put him in a position to get Court Martialed and sent to prison for THIRTY YEARS?!"

K: "It's not your fault, Sargasso." I put my hand on her shoulder. "He made his own choices. At any time, he could have taken the lead and headed out to assist. And as Ochre testified, he probably would have followed. He failed to provide leadership. Just like Northern Star had." I said, reminding her of how she ended up Commodore. "You probably won't heed my advice if I say you can't blame yourself." I shrugged. "You're too headstrong." I smirked.

She snickered through the tears and snot.

K: "Take some time off. I can't have my Fleet Commander going to pieces over her trauma. It's going to take a while to get the fleet repaired - Tirek did succeed in destroying three of the troop transports." We'd arranged for six. "He also damaged several ships we need. We can do some substitution, but that would leave Equestria under-defended." I shrugged. "And me without the Marines needed to finish the fight in Neighpon. So, take some leave. Go talk to your folks. Come back when you're healed." I tapped her chest. "In here."

Sargasso: "Th-thank you.. Gener-"

K: "Just K. We're friends." I smiled at her.

Sargasso: "K." She nodded. "If you'll excuse me, I wanted to go see to my wounded.." She looked at the door.

K: "Of course." I nodded, gave her a quick hug, and departed.

Celestia and Luna had decided on a 'dawn' conference as we evaluated our options.

Warships Luna, Neighvada, and Las Pegasus were out of commission, all in serious need of repair. Repairs to the torpedo penetration on Shining Armor were almost complete. Baleston and Maresechusetts would be out for a bit longer. We lost four ships and three troop transports.

Luna: "So, what do you advise, My General?" She was getting sleepy, but she was with it.

K: "We wait. At the very least until we can source and retrofit three replacement transport ships." I shrugged.

Sacquet came in about that time, and rushed right up to me.

Sacquet: "Mon Marechal! Er.. pardon my boldness, your Highnesses!" He was excited. "Marechal.. Princess Escargot has approved my request.. she will be sending the Prench fleet and our own Fusiliers Marins." He bowed a little. "And has agreed to give you command of our troops."

K: "Sonova.. what, really!?" I was taken aback.

Sacquet: "On.. zee.. condition that I and my Legionnaires go with." He gave me THE CHEEKIEST grin I'd ever seen.

K: "Why you little Baguette munchin' Prenchpony..!" I couldn't be mad, but I wagged a finger at him.

And soon behind him, came Prince Blueblood, whom I hadn't seen in ages. He was in a Royal Ambleon Navy uniform, with a rank of Commander.

Blueblood: "That's not all, General." He marched up to the table, and bowed his head slightly. "Red Squadron and the Royal Ambleon Marines.. have already arrived." He smirked at Saquet.

Sacquet: "Sacre bleu!" He seemed.. offended? One-upped?

And right about THEN.. the third entrant into this jamboree arrived. A very stuffy, tough-built grey stallion, in a somewhat ornate, but very clearly Germane uniform. Bicorne hat, spread-lapel jakcet with the interior of the jacket white, and cut long over the hip, with trousers leading to calf-high boots. All in black, with gold trim and white facings. His moustache was very Otto von Bismarck. He had a monocle.

Adm. von Kaltbluter: "Herr General-Feldmarschall K." He stopped, clicked his back hooves together, and bowed. "Allow me to present meinself. I am Vizeadmiral Freiherr Koch von Kaltbluter. Hist royal highness, zee Prinz Hoffnungsteher, hast dispatched the Bundesmarine and a task force centered around the battleship Thuringa, along with the Marinekampftruppe.." He then bowed to the Princesses. "Vith your permission, your Royal Highnesses, vee place our ships und troops under command of NEIGHTO Supreme Allied Commander, General-Feldmarschall K."

K: "You.. you all do realize, this is only a warm-up, right? The eventual invasion of Tirek's homelands will be much larger.." I trailed off.

Sacquet, Blueblood, and Kaltbluter all looked at me like this was completely obvious.

Blueblood: "K.. if we're going to pull that off, we need experienced troops. We can't just have mostly green military forces get their first taste of battle, on the day of the largest military operation this planet has ever seen." He shrugged. "NEIGHTO is in this war, too. Don't feel as though Equestria has to do everything."

Sacquet: "Oui. And what few soldiers of ours that have served with you? We cannot be everywhere." He nodded.

Kaltbluter: "Ja. Our Bundesmarine has no experience besides basic trainings. Before zee war, our ships performed coastal patrol for rescues, and occasionally, fight griffon raiders, or perhaps a pirate. Navalized veppens larger zan ballistae were unknown to us before you showed us them." He shrugged. "While our navy is proud of its traditions as fine seaponies.. we do not, DID not, know how to fight."

K: "Well, I'll take it." I nodded. "Alright. Everyone come here, and put your cards on the table - tell me what you're bringing to the fight." I nodded to Admiral Kaltbluter. "You first, Baron von Kaltbluter. You're our newest friend."

He smiled at the recognition I had for the title "Freiherr" being translated to Baron. I didn't think anyone told him I could speak German. Rarity came in right about that time, in her Naval Attache outfit. Her hair was finally fully back to its full length and luster.. and I knew part of the reason she was here was me. But, I beckoned her over.

K: "Rarity, this is Vice Admiral, the Baron von Kaltbluter." I said, even making the title introduction proper. "Baron, this is miss Rarity, my Naval advisor.. and fashion designer extraordinare."

Rarity: "An honor, Admiral." She offered her hoof like a lady.

Kaltbluter: "M'Lady." He gently, curtly took her hoof, but did not kiss it fully - as is standard Germane manners. "An honor. Der Prinze Hoffnungsteher recently showed off one of your hunting jacket designs." He raised a brow respectfully.

Rarity: "War leaves me little time to design like I once did, but we shall see this war ended, Baron, that you may perhaps peruse my wares." She gave him a small smile.

Kaltbluter: "You do me honor, m'lady." He bowed his head slightly, then returned to the task at hand. "Vee bring zee Battleship Thuringia, Armored Cruisers Gotha and Erfurt, Scout Cruiser Hamover, and Zerstorers Heimdall and Hagen. Along vith them, vee haff one battalion of Marinekampftruppe in zee troop ships Prinzessen and Freifrau."

K: "A proper task force. I'll want to meet your ship captains, of course." I nodded.

Kaltbluter: "Jes, of course." His accent was rather thick, but understandable.

K: "Blueblood?" I nodded to him.

Blueblood: "Battleships HMAS Invincible and HMAS Inflexible. Armored Cruisers Marechester, Essex, Kent and Hamstershire. Protected Cruisers Sheffield and Southamton. Frigates Faulknor, Broke, Tipperary, and Howe. Corvettes Sparrow, Hawk, Robin, and Eagle. We also have a battalion of Royal Ambleion Marines embarked aboard Troop Ships Lyle, Anton, Crown Princess, and Spirit of Thames." He nodded to me.

I could see Rarity writing them all down on a large paper at the center of the table.

K: "Sacquet?" I tilted my head.

Sacquet: "Well.. besides myself and my Legionnaires!" He chuckled. "Battleship Normandie, Armored Cruisers Conde and Conti, Scout Cruisers Siene and Loire, Destroyers Durandal, Hallebarde, Fauconneau, and Espingole. Torpedo Boats Spahi and Hussard. Plus, a battalion of Fusiliers Marins, aboard three troop ships - Georgette, Andre, and Paula."

K: "Rarity, running total." I nodded to her.

Rarity: "Four battleships, eight Armored Cruisers, two Protected Cruisers, three Scout Cruisers, two Destroyers, eight Frigates, six Corvettes. Plus nine Troop Ships, and three total battalions of Marines."

Celestia: "What can we contribute, right now?" She was adamant.

K: "Battleships Celestia and Shining Armor. Armored Cruisers Docksylvania, Canterlot and Greenbroke - though if we wait a week, which I want to for other reasons, we can add Maresechusetts. Protected Scout Cruisers Hosston, Martingalier, and Fillydelphia. Frigates Unicorn, Pegasus, Terra, Crystal, and Daedalus. Corvettes Alacrity, Adventure, Advance, and Aware." I shrugged. "Remaining on-roster vessels are either damaged and under repair, fitting out, or not yet complete." I gestured. "The three remaining troop ships can carry about one battalion and two extra companies. But, there's a problem." I looked at the officers. "Your marines, they don't have organic artillery, either, do they?"

They all looked at me like they'd JUST realized this mistake.

K: "Don't blame yourselves. Marines were never meant to have organic heavy arms. That's why I needed the other three troop ships - I needed space to bring a full Artillery Battalion and two full Marine Battalions." I shrugged at them. "Anyone got any spare troop transports? We're kinda fresh out and they're not in season, yet."

There was some light chuckling in the room. Celestia chuckled, Luna snickered, Baron von Kultbluter snorted bemused, Blueblood and Rarity did polite titters.. the table groaned at the bad joke.

Then there was silence.
