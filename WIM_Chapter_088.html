Part 1: Stable Stabling Stability

LOCATION: Canterlot, Colorado, USA

Sunset: "..that was amazing, and I want more before we leave." She cuddled me.

Kay: "You taste like cherry lemonade." I commented, just laying flat.

Sunset: "Really?" She nuzzled me - I should point out, more like a horse than a human.

Kay: "All you girls have a flavor. I don't know why. Applejack tastes like apples.. heck, Dusty tastes like chocolate milk.. lunch room chocolate milk, not the expensive stuff." I smirked.

Sunset: "Yeah, I've.. had to drink that quite a lot. It's cheap, but.."

Kay: "..addictive." I chuckled a bit.

Sunset: "IT IS!" She squeezed me a little. "All these human experiences.. is it nice to have someone around that understands?"

Kay: "Yeah. It kinda is." I unfolded my arms from behind my head, and put one around her, pulling her in a little closer. "I.. hope we're not genetically compatible."

Sunset: "..oh, oops." She blinked. "I never.." She made a small noise.

Kay: "Didn't think of that, did you?" I looked at her a bit.

Sunset: "No. No, I.. I still see myself as a pony." She murr'd again.

Kay: "Well.. who knows? Have you been having periods every month, instead of a once-per-year estrus?" I shrugged a bit.

Sunset: "..monthly.." She suddenly had a look of 'I have made a terrible mistake.'

Kay: "I won't ask you to get an abortion, if it happens - it's against my religion, technically." I nodded off to the side a bit.

Sunset: "Oh. Are you one of those Christians?" She understood this bit.

Kay: "Catholic. But, not a serious one. I still put God before, say, Tiamat or Galactica Spark. Definitely before Galactica Spark." I snorted.

Sunset: "I see." She nuzzled my chest a bit. "Mmmm.. it's nice to feel this. To.. feel.. someone that.. cares about me."

Kay: "I do care." I nodded a bit. "I would die to protect you. And I will get revenge on Tirek for what he did to you."

Sunset: "And you'd never hurt me." She kissed my cheek.

Kay: "Keep in mind, this is just until we leave. After that.. you'll have to take up things with the other girls, to see if they'll let you in the Paddock on a permanent basis. It's.." I chuckled a bit. "..rather full, even by Alpha Male Stallion standards."

Sunset: "For serious. Who's who, in there?" She was curious.

Kay: "AJ is first, always. Luna is second-"

Sunset: "Princess Luna, second to AJ? Wow." She was a bit surprised.

Kay: "-Rarity and Dusty have relatively equal standing. Dusty is my side piece if AJ can't be with me, in a combat-oriented situation. And Rarity, in a diplomatic one. Both, of course, have permission if they want it. Katrina is.. ehh.. I'd say she's on the 'permitted' list, but we only ever did it once. She has no interest in females, and made it clear, if we ever did it again, it would be me and her and no one else." I nodded. "And Celestia and I have done it a couple times - only because I have a stamina that matches hers, and I'm the only one she'd accept in that kind of a position.. she sees me as a kind of Co-Parent to Ponykind with her, and Momma has needs every now and then. So, yeah, that's five. I've also done all the Elements, even Pinkie, as well as another pony that wasn't at the palace - Lyra Heartstrings, who's now Gaze's girl." I said, recounting my history. "I also did Rainbow Dash's wife, Gilda, who you met. THAT was interesting. She.. her Griffonic culture sort of expected me, as her Pride Leader, to have her.. even if she was with someone else. She also has - HAD - fantasies.. ehm.. she's quite lesbian, but she openly admitted to fantasizing about specifically me.. enforcing that Griffonic rule. She has a thing for non-Griffons." I didn't mention Admiral Emerald - that was quite private.

Sunset: "Wow.." She blinked. "..I had a boyfriend in High School, I mean.. first.. pony high school. We fooled around some, but.." She shook her head. "..always wanted to try another mare." She got a thoughtful look on her face.

Kay: "AJ is going to insist on it." I smirked. "That'll be fun."

Sunset: "Mmm. So, you DO enjoy my company." She traced a finger down my chest.

Kay: "Oh, I never claimed otherwise. I'm just saying, you have a price to pay, later." I looked down at her again.

Sunset: "Mm. Deal." Straightforward.

Kay: "And no matter what, I want you to promise me you'll keep your heart open - I'm sure there's someone out there, for you. I don't want you thinking that I'm holding you back, or anything." I stroked her back.

Sunset: "Oh, for sure." She moaned just a little. "But, I'm going to take full advantage of this, while I have it."

Kay: "Okay." I shrugged. "Now, I'm very sleepy.." I cuddled her. "..no talks, only sleeps, now."

I.. just didn't give a fuck, any longer - and, I was sure she wouldn't be the last one to wander within dicking range before the war was over, given that I had several others still interested.

For the moment, we went to sleep.. it was kinda nice to have someone here I could be intimate with. I had to admit, ever since I got with J--, I'd grown accustomed to and addicted to the sensation of having someone close to me.

Four years among the horsed kind, hadn't changed a thing.

Part 2: Contacting Contacted Contacts

TIME: 09:25 MST
DATE: Monday, 8 March 2004
LOCATION: Canterlot, Colorado, USA

We got out well before the 10AM check-out time. I was also wearing a new digital watch - I did not have the analogue watch given to me, ages ago, to replace the digital I'd come to Equestria with. THAT watch was a coverless pocket watch encased in a leather wrist strap, manual winding. Because they didn't have micro batteries.

Time to get a place. Now that it was Monday, most of the check had cleared. Apparently, whoever "I" was in this world, hadn't done any boo-boo crimes. We drove around the cheaper side of Canterlot.. and I spotted a rather nice small home for sale.

"For Sale, By Owner"

No internet address - this being the early 00's, I wasn't surprised. So, I called the number.

Kay: P> "Yeah, hi. I'm curious about the house on 1405 Red Canyon Road..?"

Familiar Voice: P> "Ahhh.. yeah, that was my grandma's house. She passed a couple years ago.." He cleared his throat. "It's in good shape, had the water heater replaced and everything.."

Kay: P> "How much? It's a two bed, one bath, 800 square feet, right?" I estimated.

Familiar Voice: P> "..how much? Uh. Well. How do you mean?"

Kay: P> "I want to see if I can just buy it outright." I nodded, even though Sunset was the only one in HER car with me.

Familiar Voice: P> "...outright?" He was confused.

Kay: P> "Yeah. Outright. I'm moving into town, and I don't want to rent."

Familiar Voice: P> "Where you at?"

Kay: P> "Right out front."

Familiar Voice: P> "Hang on a second."

He hung up, then I saw a tall gentleman come out of the house next door. My brow raised.. it was human Sunshine Smiles.

I got out of the car, and paced over, with my hand out. His was filthy with car grease, and he went to rub it off, but I grabbed it anyway, showing him I had no fear of an honest man's sweat and dirt.

Kay: "My name's K----." I shook hard, he shook hard.

Sunshine: "Sunny." He nodded. "Ahh.. where're you moving from?"

Kay: "Aurora. Trying to get away from the crazies in Denver." I shrugged.

This being in the middle of the cultural conversion of the State of Colorado and Denver in specific, from a more conservative, to a growingly radical-progressive body politic.

Sunshine: "You.." He looked at Sunset. "..oh, hey, Sunset, right?"

Sunset: "Yeah.. yeah." She smiled at him. "You were two years ahead of me - I thought you were going to The Academy?"

This being Colorado, she could only mean the United States Air Force Academy by Colorado Springs.

Sunshine: "Couldn't get a Congressional appointment.. Granny died before she could write the letter." He shrugged. "So, I enlisted. I'm on leave, right now. I'm going back over in about four more months."

Kay: "Ess-Pee?" For Security Police, or Security Forces, the Air Force equivalent of MP's.

Sunshine: "Yeah.. yeah." He nodded. "886th Expeditionary."

Kay: "My grandpa was Army Air Corps." I shrugged.

Sunshine: "Really?" He grew more at-ease.

Kay: "Yeahh.. he was kind of a hero - saved a couple guys from a burning plane shot down by our own guys." I gave a dismissive hand wave. "I wanted to follow in his footsteps in some way."

Which is entirely true. I left out the part that, to save the second man, he had to chop off the man's legs with a fire axe in order to get him out of the burning aircraft before it exploded.

Sunshine: "Sorry to hear that happened, but, cool!" He shrugged. "Ahh.. the house.." He paced over to it, a little. "..I don't know, man. I've been trying to sell it for years, ya know? Ever since she died. Not like I haven't had offers. Just.. it's hard."

Kay: "Well, I getcha. Still - you know anything else I could get?" I looked a bit, to Sunset.

Sunshine: "Oh! You know what.. can you do $35,000?" He looked right at me.

Kay: "Sure. Heck, I can cut a check right now for that." I nodded. "I sold my house in Aurora and sold some old coins my family had.. I can give you the whole amount." I gave him an 'up-nod' with my chin. "What'cha got?"

Sunshine: "Come on with me. It's a bit of a walk.. but.. I think you might like this." He gestured for us to follow.

After a good seven minute walk up a gravel drive, we arrived at a nicely cleared piece of land, with a prefab house on it. The vernacular term would be "double-wide trailer." It, however, looked brand new, and had a proper foundation to it.

Sunshine: "My sister.. I was going to give it to her.." He cleared his throat a little. "..she's in jail."

Kay: "I'm so sorry.." I said, patting his shoulder. "What'd she get in for?"

Sunshine: "Murder." He got a little choked up. "She.. ah.. she killed our old dance teacher for.. the things he did to us." He looked down.

Kay: "I had an uncle." I said, one-arm hugging him from the side, saying no more than needed said. "What'd they give her?"

Sunshine: "Twenty years." He snorted. "They wouldn't let in any evidence that he.. did things to kids."

Kay: "Miscarriage of justice, for sure." I frowned.

Sunshine: "The DA, Scorpan, was very.. very mad at her.. he told her he was going to bury her under the prison." He spat on the ground.

Well.. that was another major target I had to take care of.

Sunshine: "..fucker's running for Governor, now." He growled.

Kay: "Oh, really? He got a chance?" I tilted my head.

Sunshine: "Might. Our current Governor's.. kinda falling out of favor with the new crowd. You know - Denver people." He crossed his arms.

It seems I would not be able to escape politics, after all.

Kay: "Let me guess. Scorpan's promising lower prosecution and relaxed arrests on broken window crimes?" I tilted my head. "Maybe, legalizing some Mary Jane?"

Sunshine: "Among other things." His face screwed tight.

Kay: "Doesn't sound like someone I'm eager to support.. Broken Window Crimes and the punishment for them are a cultural, judicial and criminal bulwark. They remind would-be lesser criminals that there are punishments for violating the social contract. And, generally, this reminder keeps them from challenging the next level of crimes." A dry, analytical view of the situation.

Sunshine: "Something like that." He gave a dismissive hand wave. "Anyway.."

Kay: "Let's go to my bank, and get you that check, then register everything at City Hall. I'll buy lunch, even." I smirked at him.

Sunshine: "That sounds great!" He perked up - hey, free lunch!


TIME: 13:22 MST
LOCATION: Burger Barn, Canterlot, CO

We feasted on the blood of Mooburger Mondays - all regular hamburgers were half price, making them a buck each. I found out Sunshine was an E-4 Senior Airman (E-4 Mafia, you are thusly represented), and had already done one tour overseas.

His leave was technically a hardship leave, given that his sister did those things while he was deployed, went to trial, and he got back more or less in time to see her convicted and sentenced. His mother was deceased, too - he was, essentially, all alone.

Like me, he hawkishly eyed the cheaper deals - E-4's don't make a mint, and he was long used to taking advantage of every sale and cupon he could. We'd both experienced poverty. And, to be honest, for completely different reasons, I found myself bonding with the same person once again. By the end of the meal, we were Bro's.

Kay: "Hey, thanks for the company." I shrugged.

Sunshine: "No problem.. it's been a while since I connected with anyone outside of the Air Force." He smirked.

Kay: "Yeah, hey, we gotta get going.. ah, I didn't see the inside, but I can't imagine it's furnished?" I tilted my head.

Sunshine: "Some basic stuff. Got a couch-hideaway in there, microwave, came with a stove and a range, washer-dryer.. all electric." He nodded.

Kay: "Well.. I don't need MUCH else. Bedclothes, washer-dryer stuffs, food.." I shrugged a bit. "I got my dob kit, but.. yeah, you know. Trip to Wal-Mart time."

Sunshine: "Alright. Well, hey, tell ya what.. come on by tomorrow morning, we'll go shoot some." He smirked.

Kay: "Sounds awesome."

Sunset: "Sounds fun!" She gave him a broad grin.

We, indeed, did another trip to Wal-Mart. The essentials for home living. We stocked up, and got Sunset, her own cell phone. These cell phones were about five years behind the one I came to Equestria with - mine WAS an older model. So, they lacked storage space.

I bought a second laptop and a portable hard drive with 500GB of storage. I was going to scour the internet, and take anything back with me that I possibly could. Information. Technology. How to make things.

This being the very end of the dark ages of the Internet, things weren't centralized, yet. Not like they were in 2012. I had to manually search up things, scour message boards, the works. HTML files, being small in this era, I just saved wholesale.

Most of the rest of the day, I spent with her at a coffee shop, taking advantage of the fact that they actually offered WiFi if you bought their over-priced bean water. This, after looting her apartment for anything we might need - and her clothes and things.

Interestingly, I did search for "My Little Pony," and got nothing. Another search for cartoons from the 1980's yeilded odd results. While some stalwart 1980's staples seemed to exist, anything intellectually connected to the MLP franchise, did not. Instead, their parent corporation, Hasbro, had invented the "Littlest Pet Shop" line of toys many years earlier, and this seemed to culturally replace anything even distantly related to "My Little Pony."

Fascinating.

I also noted that some other brands had survived better, here, like Visionaries getting a full 65-episode Syndication Package instead of 13 episodes, The Real Ghostbusters not being challenged by the original "Ghost Busters" franchise owner, Filmation, and The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers getting two whole seasons, and a blockbuster film that rivalled the budget and reach of G.I. Joe the Movie (and came out a week before), but, despite providing an ending to the series, the film didn't do as well.. because the G.I. Joe film grossed something like twice what it had in my world.

I relished all of this. Sunset? Was doing research on Tirek and Scorpan as best as the Late-Early Internet would allow.

I had called the local ISP and we would have DSL hooked up tomorrow.

Once we had our fill of information, we did head home, though. And, once there, I did something I hadn't done much of in the last four years - I cooked.

Sunset: "That.. smells great." She smiled and came over, from doing her laundry.

Kay: "My wife's recipie. Hamburger Stew." I shrugged.

Sunset: "You really miss her, don't you?" She slid up next to me.

Kay: "...I already checked. She either doesn't exist, here, or she's an entirely different person. I'm edging towards 'does not exist here' since this world is a reflection of yours, not mine." I had, too.. I had to know.

Sunset: "Did you look for anyone else that might help us?" She was talking, the alts of other ponies.

Kay: "As best I could." I shrugged. "I found Forest Spirit.. he's Major Forest Spirit, USMC, decorated with a Silver Star recently, for action in Kandahar Province."

Sunset: "Darnit." She frowned.

Kay: "Most of the more esoteric members of the militaries I know, aren't anywhere close to us. I found Norfy, he's a professor at the University of Michigan. Cosmic owns a bakery in Baltimore. Gaze.. I can't find him. He's probably in Scotland, somewhere." I shrugged. "And, more far-flung people.."

I leaned over to the Laptop where I had webpages saved. I brought up a page on World War I German admirals.. Kaltzbluter was there - 1866 to 1938 - long dead. Brigadier Fosberry, 1871 to 1917, died in the Battle of Arras. Prince Blueblood, here merely the Duke of Cornwall, born 1727 died 1751. It was all over the place.

Kay: "..were either born and died a long time ago, or didn't become noteworthy enough to warrant an entry into any history book or site that I can find." I shrugged, stirring the pot some.

Sunset: "So.. we.. can't expect any help." She shrugged.

Kay: "Nope." I shook my head.

The stew was ready, and I dished it out. We sat at the dining room table (a card table, actually) and ate.

Sunset: "This is common." She said, more asking for confirmation.

Kay: "Used to be. Dies out in a few years, really, as 'the future' advances, and people simply lack the time." I shrugged.

Sunset: "I like this." She smiled at me.

Kay: "We do this every chance we get, back home." I looked down at my cup of milk.. then back up to Sunset. "Yeah. Home."

Sunset: "Equestria IS your home, now, isn't it?" She smirked a little.

Kay: "I guess it is." I smiled.. but it was a sad smile - I was fairly certain I'd never see my Earth again.

We finished up, and discussed various things with the rest of our evening. Somewhere in there, we ended up cuddling on the huge couch.. and falling asleep together.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Pinkerrific Pinkie Pie

TIME: TIME: 08:28 MST
DATE: Tuesday, 9 March 2004
LOCATION: Canterlot, Colorado, USA

We were up early to go shooting with Sunshine.. no, Sunny. He was Sunny. He was different than Prince Consort Sunshine Smiles. He was Senior Airman Sunny Smiles.

Handling an AR-15 for the first time in my life, I drilled laser holes into the target, enjoying the light feel compared to the Bradley's 7mm near battle rifle-grade round.

Of course, we needed a round like that, to take Porcine.

Still, my ability to move, engage, snap to the next target, advance, two-step, tuck, roll, and shoot tight groups.. that was all combat experience.

Sunny was shocked at how well I handled the weapon..

I finished the magazine, then followed up with a blazing fast transition to the M-19, and put six rounds on six targets, and nailing the Stressfire Reload like a champ.

Sunny: "Whoa.. are you a competition shooter, or something?" He chuckled.

Kay: "Or something." I shrugged, and put the AR-15 back on his bench, hefting his Ruger AC-556.

It was dressed up A-Team Style. Chromed with a folding stock. I popped the stock out, racked it up, snapped it into position, and put all 20 rounds in the "A" kill bracket on his standard targets.

On ten tagets, one at a time, then back across, for two shots each.

My reload was flawless.

I put it back down, and retrieved my discarded Safariland speed loader (that was originally Colonel Williams'), and refilled it.

I didn't realize just HOW amazed Sunshine was with my ability to engage things like this, at the speed I did, with the precision I did, and the method I'd used.

Sunny: "..okay, I know I shouldn't ask this." He looked at Sunset, then to me.

Kay: "Airman, what's your clearance?" I used the right words.

Sunny: "..not high enough, if you're asking me." He chuckled. "Holy shit."

Kay: "I can't go into it." I looked at him. "But, there's a reason I'm hanging around a high school student - it has to do with Tirek, Scorpan, and a possible conspiracy. You're in the Ess-Effs. Worked with ATF before? Or FBI?" I knew both did interface with USAF SF's from time to time.

Sunny: "Yeah.. FBI, once. Right after I got assigned to the 886th, before we went over. Some stolen weapons.. we never recovered them." He shrugged. "ATF was there, too."

Kay: "Well. This hasn't anything to do with the military." I sighed. "It's very complicated.. and if it goes wrong, I'm going to be denied, burned, and left to hang." I wasn't lying through my teeth, but I knew all the right things to say.

It was the truth that if things went wrong, here, no one would acknowledge me. My ponies wouldn't be able to come rescue me. I'd go to jail or die in a shootout with the police.

Sunny: "This must be pretty bad." He blinked.. but, he understood, too.

Kay: "You have a past with it." I didn't explain further, but I sized up his Remington 1100 shotgun, and started loading it.

Sunny: "...SHIT!" His eyes went wide. "You're saying.."

Kay: "I haven't 'said' anything, Sunny." I said, referring to him in the familiar, very much on purpose, but using my "General K" voice, to address him.

Sunny: "Right, right.. but.." I watched the gears turn. "..if they're.." He looked at Sunset.

She looked very ashamed of herself, and looked at the ground.

Sunny: "..I want in." He made a short sniff. "All enemies, foreign and domestic." He went hard with that sentence.

Kay: "Okay. But, remember, everything is totally without anyone's knowledge around here - and there's no one coming to save us if we screw this up." Again, the truth.

Sunny: "People like that.. deserve the worst." He looked at Sunset, then back to me. "That part of the reason you came out here?"

Kay: "That and to refamiliarize myself with these." I hefted the shotgun. "I'm going to need to acquire some. Everything's OSP. That and, protocol aside, she needs to learn how to use these. I'm only one man." Still, not lying - just implying.

Sunny: "I'll help with that." He nodded. "What else can I do?"

Kay: "I need to make contact with someone that might have information I need - another student. Pinkie Pie." I looked over at him. "My objective is to gather all the evidence I can, and remove Tirek and his other possible conspirators from power, somehow. Understand, I have flexibility in how this is accomplished. But, they must be nullified. Dead, arrested, or have a public spotlight shone so brightly on their activities that they'll never be able to hurt anyone ever again."

Sunny: "I getcha. It's not a guarantee the ending will be satisfying, but.. it'll be something." He nodded. "I.. kinda figured from the way you handled weapons, how you stalk, how you move, that you've.. you're one of those real professionals. I dunno, it's just something about people like you."

And that, right there, is a result of being in combat for three years. Of planning, executing, and personally leading large battles and small skirmishes. From standing before a Goddess of Dragons, and facing an absolute monster of Death not once, but twice. I'd changed.. and he was the one that pointed it out.

Kay: "I suppose there is." I sighed. "I'm hoping I can get this done as fast as possible. At the absolute latest, the election in November. I'd prefer.. MUCH sooner than that."

Sunny: "Well, I'm on Hardship Leave until July 17th. I mean, I can request an extension if I have to.. they'll probably give it." He shrugged.

Kay: "Don't endanger your career, Sunny, if it comes down to it." I gently side-nodded to him.

Sunny: "Mm.. we're a team, now, though. I don't abandon my team." He smirked.

Kay: "Okay. Let's start Sunset on the basics. Rifles are easier to master than pistols.."

We spent the rest of the morning putting Sunset through a crash course in Firearms 101. I also taught both of them some of the tricks I'd picked up 'in the field' - and no, I wasn't specific about where that was. I was determined not to directly lie to Sunny - lie-by-omission, yes, but that's only because he'd never believe the truth.

After that, we cruised the town, looking for Pinkie. Sunny cruised by himself - me and Sunset did so together. We hit up the few places in town she might be found, if she was out and about. We got nowhere.

Then, someone unexpected let us in on a secret.


TIME: 13:44 MST
LOCATION: Perky Beans Coffee, Canterlot, CO

Dexter Runner: "It's like I said - she's planning a rave tonight." He sipped the cappuchino this information cost me.

Kay: "Sounds great - where?" I smirked.

Dexter: "Not sure, man. I'm one of the Dee-Jays, but, dude, I'm not even going to know until about an hour before it happens. It's to keep the cops off our backs, you know?" He shrugged.

Kay: "Doesn't give you much time to set up." I frowned. "Need a hand?" I did know a thing or two..

Dexter: "Sure! Man, my gear's heavy and expensive.." He shook his head. "..I can get most'a it in my mom's station wagon, but, like this, I'd have to make two trips."

Kay: "We can fit the rest in Sunset's car, I'm sure." I nodded a bit.

Dexter: "Awesome, dude. I'll text you when I get the text, you can meet me at my place." He beamed a grin.

Kay: "Catch'ya later." I patted him on the shoulder, as Sunset and I departed.

Sunset: "Seems a bit shakey." She looked back at him.

Kay: "From what I gather, the people here still have the base essence of the ponies they reflect. Dex is one of my best Rangers. Deep down, he's not a bad person - there's no war, here, so, he's a DJ." I shrugged. "I bet he's rivals with Vinyl Scratch - in Equestria, they're married."

Sunset: "Neat. So.. now what?" She tilted her head at me.

Kay: "Go home, try to take a nap, make sure the phone's volume is all the way up. My guess, it won't start until after 9. Probably closer to 11. We better get some rest, so we're not exhausted." I said, texting Sunny.

Sunset: "Are you going to tell him?" She meant.. about us.

Kay: "Yeah. When I have him break the Mirror so Tirek can't reinfest this world, if we lose the war." I said, grimly.

Sunset: "K!" She was surprised. "That.. means.." She blinked. "K, you could get a fresh START here.. among HUMANS.. your own kind! If you can't find a way back.. and.." She shook her head.

Kay: "At the same time, I'm Equestria's commanding general, and a United States citizen - I'm fulfilling my moral obligation both ways by making sure Tirek or some future evil, can't invade my country - no matter what version of it, it is." I sniffed, a bit.

Sunset: "..and sacrifice a possible life, here, among your own kind in the process." She took my hand in hers. "How are you so noble?"

Kay: "It's not nobility, it's logic, and loyalty." I squeezed her hand, though.

Part 4: Pinkie Pie PARTY!

TIME: 22:22 MST
DATE: Tuesday, 9 March 2004
LOCATION: Canterlot, Colorado, USA

She had a sense of timing. The phone woke us up. We got dressed for this - different clothes, more fitting an underground rave/music party sort of deal. I actually regretted not bringing my PA-63, now, since it'd be perfect for this. The M-19 was harder to conceal.

I made it work, though. And we were off to pick up Dexter's gear. He didn't live that far, either.

I got out first, to make sure it wasn't a trap, and went up to him, in his garage.

Kay: "Hey, bud. We're here, like I promised." I nodded to him.

Dexter: "Great! Here, grab these.." He pointed to a few thick plastic cases with his tag on them.

Kay: "Where's the rave?" I asked, as I grabbed as many as I could.

Dexter: "I'll lead you there." He shrugged. "Come on, dude. You're new in town, you're asking those kindsa questions.." He wagged a finger at me.

I pulled out my phone, and handed it to him.

Dexter: "What's this for?" He looked at it, then me.

Kay: "You don't trust me - I wouldn't trust me, either. That's so I can't call the buddies you think I have. I'm not a cop, dude, but I get it. I'm not offended." I chuckled a little.

Dexter: "..oh. Yeah." He blinked.

We loaded up, and he drove to the location, with us following. Behind us about two blocks, was Sunny, in his grandmother's old Buick, not his Ford F-150.

We were led to the abandoned lumber mill on the north edge of town - not THAT terribly far from the house I'd just bought.

I got out, and started unloading Dex's gear. Sunny knew that if he heard gunshots, he'd have to come running.

About halfway through setting up, she arrived.

Pinkie: "DEEEEXTER!" She zoomed in, and hugged him from behind. "Looks like you're almost done!" She looked at me, and smiled very strangely.

Kay: "We talk." I nodded outside.

Pinkie: "Sure thing, K." She patted Dex down-

Dexter: "Hey! That tickles!"

-and got my cellphone back from him, which she handed over.

Pinkie: "Should've told Dex we were friends, K." She gave me the silliest grin.

Kay: "Like he'd believe me." I grinned back at her.

Sunset: "Hi, Pinkie." She looked down.

Pinkie: "Aww, come on Sunset! It's a PARTY!" She zoomed over and hugged her, pinching her cheeks into a grin, as she led us outside.

She didn't say a word until we were fifty yards from the building.

Pinkie: "He's looking for me." She stated, flatly.

Kay: "Then-" I started.

She held out one hand, flicked her wrist, produced a piping hot apple muffin, and jammed it in my mouth.

She was MY Pinkie Pie!

I hugged her.. and I cried a little.

Pinkie: "Aww.. K----." She squished my cheeks, and kissed me - a friendly kiss, not a lewd one.

Sunset: "You're THE Pinkie! Just as I thought!" She blinked.

Pinkie: "Sure am." She slung an arm around Sunset. "You'll make a GREAT Element of Magic, Sunset." She looked back to me. "In this universe, I can keep my power under control a LOT easier. There's magic, here, but it's so dulled, my powers have a hard time manifesting themselves."

Kay: "So.. you decided to come here, and watch over it." I nodded.

Pinkie: "Sure did. I couldn't do much. The Tirek here, is our Tirek's Shadow Clone." Still thinking like she's one of my soldiers.

Kay: "And if we.. nullify him?" I gestured.

Pinkie: "Hurt him, our Tirek hurts. The more this Tirek is able to do to spread darkness - misery, pain, whatever - the more power OUR Tirek gains. They feed each other." She looked over to the side a bit.. then, when both Sunset and I went to look at what she was looking at, she 'cartoon vanished.'

Sunset: "Wh-" She blinked.

Kay: "She has power." I nodded a bit. "She knows shortcuts."

A moment later, she came walking up with Sunny.

Sunny: "..Kay?" He looked between me, Sunset, and Pinkie.

Pinkie: "Hahah.. you're funny, Sunny." She beamed a grin.

Sunny: "How.. did you do that?" He looked between us all, again.

Pinkie: "Because naughty-naughty things with little ones, isn't the only thing Tirek and Scorpan and their friends are up to, Sunny." She got serious for a moment, and manifested a snow globe in her hands.

Sunny: "Oh, what the fu-" He was interrupted by a cupcake.

Pinkie: "No bad words, please." She gave him a half hug.

Kay: "I didn't think you'd believe me about this part, Sunny. Sorry." I shrugged. "Why do you think I asked about your clearance level?"

Sunny: "Mmmm.. my favorite." He looked up at me. "You're right, Kay. I wouldn't've. Not until I saw it. That explains a.. a lot, actually.."

Kay: "You used the E-4 Mafia network to check up on me, and found that while my Social Security number is valid and linked to me, I don't seem to exist." This was a GUESS.

Sunny: "Yeah.." He blinked a few times. "So, magic's real, huh?"

Kay: "When this is over, you'll have the good sense to deny it." I nodded to him.

Sunny: "Darn straight." He shrugged.

Pinkie: "Oh, don't worry, Sunny - it's not like the Men in Black are coming after you, or something." She smirked.

Kay: "Okay, Pinkie. You got a better plan than what I'm thinking up?" I gestured.

Pinkie: "It's a start, but it won't get Scorpan. Tirek won't flip on him, either. Your best bet for that is to find Grogar. He's running the Griffons." She shrugged. "The Griffons are just taking orders - they have promises they can expand to protection rackets and things, once Scorpan becomes Governor."

Kay: "Still criminals." I nodded.

Pinkie: "Yes." She was direct, but she left it unsaid that these were also my friends in another universe.

Kay: "...and I can't kill them, can I?" I tilted my head towards her.

Pinkie: "I wouldn't." A wide shrug - again left unsaid that me killing them here would have very bad repercussions in Equestria.

Kay: "Mhm." I nodded a bit. "You need a safe place, Pinkie?"

Pinkie: "Ch'yeah!" She hugged me. "Be better than couch surfing."

Kay: "Cool. Sooo..." I pointed at the Mill. "..party?"

Party indeed!

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Perfectly Perfect Pink

TIME: 04:31 MST
DATE: Wednesday, 10 March 2004
LOCATION: Canterlot, Colorado, USA

We finally got home. Pinkie kept her parties clean - no drugs. She absolutely insisted on it. No booze, either, since some of the partiers were under 21. Most, actually. So, clean music parties attended by local teens.

She didn't try to stop hormones, that.. that was a chaos beyond her control.

When we got home, though, she went through my satchel that I'd brought from Equestria, and looked at me a bit frustrated.

Pinkie: "No Hardware!?"

Kay: "I couldn't bring any of my inventions, Pinkie. I have Colonel Willaims' M-19, that's it." I shrugged.

Sunset: "We're getting some tomorrow." She patted her shoulder. "And Sunny lent us one of his shotguns in the meantime."

Kay: "It's a semi-auto - like a Chaffee - but, you have to load the shells one at a time." I hefted the Remington 1100, and showed her the loading gate. "Holds seven, plus one. Bolt's here, like on a Chaffee, just higher up."

Pinkie: "I suppose I'll get used to it." She hefted it, and refamiliarized herself with how they worked. "Yes, my magic is that weak, here. I love it. I can be my old self again." She giggled.. then looked between me and Sunset.

Sunset: "What's up, Pinkie?" She tilted her head.

Kay: "..wait, Pinkie.. no, no.." I wagged a finger at her. "You wouldn't dare!"

Pinkie set the shotgun somewhat near the hideaway, gave it a kick to make it fold out, and grabbed Sunset. She slithered in, and started making out with her. Hard. Freaking. Core.

Sunset? Was a bit surprised, at first, but then totally got into it. After about a minute, she was moaning.

Kay: "Pinkie.." I started.. sighed.. and stripped. "..I suppose this is what I get for what we did on the ship.."

Pinkie: *Drizzling lust* "Darn straight, K." She was busy getting Sunset's clothes off. "Time for a REAL party..!"

Sunset: "Ahh.. mm.. I'm going to have a three-way, aren't I?" She asked, distracted, panting with lust.

Pinkie: "Yes.. because you want one, because I have some claim over K's monkey bits, and I'm now capable of challenging the Monkey Sex God." She sassed me, as she gently pushed a naked Sunset on to the bed.


TIME: 11:22 MST

We dozed, briefly, after we enjoyed each other's company. I knew the rules for buying guns, so, I left the girls at home with the shotgun, and went to the local gun store.

I did not expect who was behind the counter.

Time Twister: "Ahh... welcome." He grinned widely. "Flip the sign."

Kay: "Okay.." I did as instructed.

Time Twister: "He's here!" He called into the back.

Four O'Clock: "Ahh.. K." He came out, and leaned on the counter. "We've been expecting you."

Kay: "Here to sell me a Sonic Screwdriver?" I smirked, and paced up.

Time Twister: "Actually... this was my idea." He shrugged.

Four O'Clock: "I agreed only because I know you humans are rather.. at a disadvantage without.. something." He shrugged.

Kay: "I'm just.. going to guess there's no reflection of you lads, here." I cleared my throat. "Certainly explains where you get the good stuff from."

Time Twister: "Yes, well.." He shrugged again, and gestured to the counter. "What do you need?"

Kay: "Glock 19, three of them. I'll take two of those Makarov pistols, too." I pointed. "1000 rounds, 9mm automatic. The good stuff - NATO Spec. 750 rounds of 9x18, Czech surplus if you've got it, 7N25 if not." I paced to the rifle rack. "I'll take this HK91A3, too." It had an appropriate Hensolt-Wetzlar Fero ZF-24 4x scope on it. Then, over one slot.. I snatched an ArmaLite 180B, with a Trijicon ACOG on it. "And this." I set that on the counter, and went across the room to the shotgun rack - Sunny may have lent me his, but I wanted one specifically for Pinkie. "This, too." I picked out a Benelli M3. "1500 rounds, 5.56mm NATO M855. 1500 rounds, 7.62mm NATO, M80. Ten mags each. Three cleaning kits. 500 rounds, 12 Gauge #00 - Federal brand. 200 Slugs." I went over to the holsters and picked out a few. "Gonna need these." And tactical vests, which I also grabbed. "And these." Then, fighting knives - Cold Steel OSS, a couple Recon 1 folders, too.. and a couple Ti-Lite's.

Weapons chosen, I also went over and picked up some tactical boots and cargo pants for myself and the girls, while the good Doctors ran my background checks for the fiream purchases. I had a feeling, despite the huge purchase, the NICS check would be fine. The boots I picked for myself, had a small slot in them for a boot knife. One of the Ti-Lites would be going in there.

Once everything was done, and my roughly $30,000 purchase approved, I picked up some pizza on the way back, and got back home. Sunny was in the yard, talking to the girls.

I just.. trotted out the goods. And watched him drool.. and Pinkie get excited. Sunset was just curious.

I hefted the Benelli to Sunny.

Kay: "You want to trade? Or..?" I looked at Pinkie, who made a sad face that I didn't get her favorite weapon type. "You know for a darn fact grenade launchers are impossible to get, legally. You'll have to deal with a shotgun." Well, not actually impossible, it'd just be a 6-month wait for a $200 tax stamp on the launcher and each shell I wanted to buy.

Pinkie: "Hmmm.." She snatched the Benelli, hefted it, snapped it to her shoulder a couple times, and shrugged. "..maybe after this is over, Sunny."

Sunny: "Okay." He shrugged.

Kay: "Range Time." I gestured. "I'm buying."

And we got out to the range, and Pinkie.. showed off. No magic, but she showed what she'd learned in the years she spent at my side. She was also flirting very heavily with Sunny...

Kay: "Bro." I dropped back, as the ladies were at the firing line, practicing with their Glocks. "Go for it. She's into you."

Sunny: "HAH! Hah.." He blushed a bit.

The girls turned and looked, then turned back.

Kay: "I mean it, bro." I nodded to Pinkie.

Sunny: "She's out of my league." He shook his head.

Kay: "You have no idea how wrong you are." And you have no idea how much I wanted to tell him that an alternate version of himself was married to a princess. "I mean it. Seriously. Give her a shot. I know her better than I can explain - she's into you, but she doesn't want to push it. She's waiting for you to make the first move - and don't be conservative about it, dude. Straight up ask her to move in with you."

Sunny: "Wh.. aaat?" He almost doubled over in embarrassment.

Kay: "Yeah. She's couch surfing to keep away from Tirek, Scorpan, Grogar and the rest. She needs a place. You invite her in, you get to keep her." I shrugged a bit. "And she won't be seeing Jody if you go overseas. She's loyal, she's warm, she's comfortable, she's fun.. and.." I gestured a bit. "..if you get fucked in the head like me, she'll be there, no matter what, to help you through it." Again, I knew the words to this song, even if I'd never sung it myself.

Sunny: "...." He thought for a long moment. "..okay." And when the girls finished their magazines, he stepped up to her. "Hey, Pinkie.."

Sunset slid over by me, and we watched it happen. Magic. No matter what universe, Sunny - or Sunshine Smiles - and I were absolute bros.
