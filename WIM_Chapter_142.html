Part 1: Argeios Offensive - Opening Move

TIME: 07:34 EET
DATE: War Day 1063/1 Tertious, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Front line area, Liveria, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


The front line advanced with the sound of an officer's whistle. Armored vehicles, backed by infantry, started rolling forward, with a rolling barrage of mechanized artillery firing far ahead of them, to decimate the second line of defense.

I was seated in the main commander's cupola of the Ratte tank loaned to me by Major General Stahl. I watched through binoculars as our allies advanced sharply. NEIGHTO was taking over the main war in Vulpesylvania. While these troops were mostly green, they were trained by Veterans.

Applejack was in the tank with me. There was lots of room, too. Immediately with me would be Broken Dawn, Golden Wattle, Fluttershy, Dusk Seeker, Rarity Seeker, and Trixie Lulamoon. Other members of CAG were interspersed with both NEIGHTO allies and our own Equestrian forces. We had A LOT of combat experience available, and the survivors of this battle would be blooded veterans themselves, taught by the best.

Dusk hopped up on the back of the tank turret, and slid over to the cupola from behind.

Dusk: "Looking good. We should be able to push them all the way back to Ptolemais." He nodded.

K: "We're dropping Webley's 1st Airborne Brigade back there, along with the Ambleonian 1st Parachute Brigade, and the German 1st Fallschrimjaeger Brigade. That's a whole Division locking the back door. They'll have a route out through Ermankla to retreat across the border." I leaned on the gun mount. "Combined with our offensives at Zoni and Paliuri, this should completely throw them out of the country."

Dusk: "So we hope." He nodded.

K: "After that, we evaluate and make sure the Vulpes are fully geared." I shrugged.

Dusk: "Then the... volunteers... help them liberate a bit more." He nodded with a grin.

K: "Mhm. I've put some thought into the supporting Rainbow Factory operation." I looked at him. "I want the Elements there. And I want you leading it." I nodded.

Dusk: "I wasn't around for the last one - Webley was." He shrugged a bit.

K: "Yeah, and.. she.. had some serious issues when she got in there." I nodded, as the artillery started to roll further away, signalling that the first line was through their first wave of objectives.

Dusk: "And if Tirek shows up?" He shrugged.

K: "Me being there isn't going to make that much difference. Besides, I don't think he will be." I rubbed my chin with my left hand. "Call it a hunch. These are all his allies, not his own troops. There'll be some Ympha scientists, but not him."

Dusk: "I hope you're right." He shrugged. "What'd'we do after this is over?"

K: "Go home for a while, go over all the books and things we got from Ambleon that we never got time to read through. Rest and replenish." I nodded. "Later this year, probably Summer, we'll try to find the Rainbow of Light again."

Dusk: "Then we prepare for the final showdown. Invasion." He nodded slowly.

K: "Yep." I smiled a bit. "I'm looking forward to ending this war." I keyed up my mic. C> "Alpha Actual to Line Bravo. Prepare to advance!"

Dusk: "Really, K.." He smiled. Warmly. "I owe you a lot. I want you to come by.. at least once a week. Something." He shrugged.

K: "You taking odds I'll be allowed to stay here?" I looked over at him.

Dusk: "I want you to." He nodded. "You know we all do."

K: "I'd like nothing more." I smiled back. C> "Line Bravo - ADVANCE!" I nodded to him. "Get to your jeep."

Dusk scurried off, and the massive tank lumbered forwards.. slowly. It wasn't built for speed. I sat at the cupola, watching, as we pressed onwards. The advance of the second line was intentionally slower than the first. Both to sweep out any possible leftovers, and to provide a solid wall for the first line to withdraw behind, if something came up.

I sat and watched. For once, everything was going according to plan. And I knew, from experience, this usually meant trouble. We'd had plenty of it so far. More than our share, to be sure. Having to do that whole Power Rangers bit to handle YET ANOTHER ancient enemy, for one. Dealing with the Greek Gods. The Darkness Wizard that the Macedonks sent. It was a.. to be fair.. eventful fight.

K: C> "Alpha Actual to Pluton Acutual." Prance's unit commander's call sign. "Status Report."

GdB Grande Bravado: C> "Oui, this is Pluton." A pause. "We have taken, thusfar, 7% casualties, and suffered some loss of vehicle support. Zee enemy is dug in, mon ami, and fights with ferocity. However, we are zee superior force, un' have uprooted them at every turn. Status on Line Bravo?"

K: C> "Line Bravo is advancing. No enemy contact." I reported.

GdB Grande Bravado: C> "I weel report if zere are any complications. Pluton, out."

Applejack: "..an' ah got a right nasty feelin' somethin' WILL be complicated!" She snorted a bit.

Unterlutnant Gunther Gans: "Ja. I agree vith zee lady, mein herr." He adjsuted himself in his seat - he was the vehicle commander.

K: "Any reason, Lutnant?" I asked, looking down.

Unterlutnant Gans: "Simple. Mein cousin vas in Neighpon." He shrugged. "I vhas told in letters vhat troubles you see, mein herr." He chuckled a bit. "Main gun breech is open, no shell loaded. Zecondary un loaded vith AP. Fuel at 96%. Engine temperature stable." He reported the vehicle's condition.

Applejack: "Mmm." She scrunched her muzzle. "Ah'm still thinkin' somethin' gonna come up." She shrugged.


TIME: 08:56 EET
LOCATION: Outside of Ptolemais, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


K: C> "Line Bravo - HOLD UP! Get to cover and stand by!" I said, seeing the town we were supposed to be responsible for.

Line Alpha would advance and leave behind blocking forces, in the bid to force the enemy to retreat across the border. They'd leave the town blocked off, but occupied. Line Bravo was to come along and either liberate it by force, or negotiate the surrender of the enemy force, while taking over Alpha's positions.

Meadow Song: C> "K! We're in good shape, here. We can go ahead and take over for Alpha."

K: C> "Do it." I instructed. "Make it fast, Meadow."

Meadow Song: C> "Roger that."

I heard over the radio as Meadow Song relayed the instructions to the subordinate units.

Dusk rolled up with his jeep. His mares were inside, with Trixie leaning on the Abrams MG, sliding to a stop in a cocky pose.

K: "Well, aren't YOU looking cocky?" I smirked.

Her camouflage cape was draped around her, over her combat uniform, as she slid down, then climbed up the Ratte with Dusk and Rarity.

Trixie: "While you ARE a married stallion, K, Rarity was rather busy while you were recovering, telling the GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie just how impressive you were." She gave me a hoof tap on the forehead and gently pushed the bill of my baseball cap down.

K: "Ah-hah." I shrugged. "And to think, Evil Trixie got every bit of it and more." I smirked. "Dusk." I nodded to him.

Dusk: "Let's just say you've given me standards to work up to." He smirked.

Applejack laughed from inside the tank and poked her head up out of the other cupola.

Applejack: "Aw, shucks, just cuz' mah stallion's the best there is..." She trailed off, winking at Rarity, who, after closing her compact, winked back.

K: "Yeah, yeah. Well, hang tight. Once our unit encircles the town and the units from Line Alpha move on, we'll have something to do." I reached down to the large potable water container inside the tank turret, and ladled out a drink.

Dusk: "How's the arm?" He nodded to me.

K: "I'll be shooting lefty, but I'll recover." I shrugged. "After the last phase of retaking territory is complete, we'll get a sizable rest while the Vulpes rearm and re-equip with donated gear." I nodded. "I'll have plenty of time to recover."

Dusk: "Mmm. Well, we got'cher back, K." He shrugged.

Broken Dawn, Golden Wattle, and Fluttershy arrived in their jeep. Fluttershy's medical bag was sqirming a little. I looked down at her from the cupola hatch, and grinned.

K: "Ooookay, miss Animal Lover. What did you find?" I asked in a slightly sing-songy voice.

Fluttershy: "Oh! Ummm." She flipped open her bag to reveal a clutch of baby animals - two puppies, a kitten, three baby bunnies, and a fox kit. "N-Nothing special.." She blushed a bit, but gave me the tiniest bit of cheek with it.

Golden: "She had me lookin' fer 'em." He beamed a grin. "Said somethin' about our kids need'n pets."

Broken: "It was.. on the way.. more or less, K." He shrugged. "There's a fawn in the back, under the tarp."

K: "Ah-hah." I nodded. "Well, get them secured, okay? This IS an active battlefield, and I think we'd all be very sad if they got hurt."

Fluttershy: "Oh! Of course." She smiled.

Applejack: "Hah.. if'n'y'all got extra, Flutters, lemme know, okay? Koringo's been buggin' fer a pet of her own." She beamed a grin.

Fluttershy: "No problem, Applejack." She 'hm'd' and set about getting the animals secured and out of her combat gear. "I know any pet I give her will be in good hooves."

Major Candy Mane: C> "Ranger One to Alpha."

K: C> "Candy Mane! Haven't heard that voice in a while. Go for Actual."

Major Candy Mane: C> "Yes, K, it's good to hear from you. Ranger One is in position and ready to assault the town."

K: C> "Roger that. K to Skyfall."

Webley: C> "Go for Actual."

K: C> "Report status."

Webley: C> "Skyfall is in position... now. Ready for orders."

K: C> "Alpha Actual for Skyfall and Ranger One. Hold position, prepare to advance if you see a GREEN flare. WHITE flare means advance and accept enemy surrender. How copy?"

Webley: C> "Skyfall copies."

Candy Mane: C> "Ranger One, copy."

K: C> "Alright. Stand by. Alpha, out." I nodded to my team. "I'm going to try and negotiate the surrender of the town." I shrugged. "If it doesn't work, as planned, Rangers and Airborne will advance to contact and conduct the main part of the offensive. I want the 1st Infantry Regiment ready to back them up." I nodded.

Dusk: "I'll go over and check personally." He nodded. "Let's go, ladies."

Golden: "Think they'll give, K?" He shrugged.

K: "I have no idea!" I shrugged back.

But, I'd soon find out.

Part 2: Argeios Offensive - Battle of Ptolemais Pt 1


TIME: 09:19 EET
DATE: War Day 1063/1 Tertious, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Ptolemais, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


I stepped forwards, with Applejack, Golden Wattle, Broken Dawn, and the power of a Ratte tank covering me. I held up a white flag, high over my head. I'd rather talk about this. The Macedonkian unit - identified as the 301st and 507th Infantry Regiments - was already damaged and under strength. While they held the town, they were surrounded. I wanted them to simply surrender.

K: "I AM GENERAL K OF EQUESTRIA!" I shouted as I got close, seeing no guards out front. "I WISH TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDER IN CHARGE! WE OFFER TERMS OF SURRENDER!"

There was silence. Nothing. Moreover, I was unarmed, as was the party.

Applejack: "Ah gots a bad feelin' - lahk, somethin' big's wrong here. Very wrong." She frowned.

Golden: "Aye, ah' had enough experience 'till now to know, she's right." He frowned a bit.

Right about then, a dark, foreboding wind gently howled across our faces. All the ponies immediately jumped, grew stiff with unreasoned fear, and when they landed, cowered BEHIND MY LEGS, chattering their teeth, and making small, terrified whinnies.

ME? Well, being both totally vulnerable to magic, AND a 'dead head' as my (human) wife calls me, such a thing felt more like a stinky skunk walked in front of me. That is to say, I was reviled, but not scared.

Still, seeing three hardened combat veterans - Applejack especially - get scared like that? I backed up. Fast.

They needed ZERO ENCOURAGEMENT to follow suit. Once we were clear, they all ran behind the Ratte and rearmed as fast as they could.

K: "Something's up here." I nodded, and grabbed for the radio pack in Fluttershy's jeep. C> "Alpha Actual to all callsigns - Code Lavender. Elements assemble at my position. Ranger One Actual and Skyfall Actual, move to my position and set up temporary field HQ. All other callsigns on full alert."

Code Lavender was one step before Code Teal. Teal was Tirek. Lavender was a general "there is magical fuckery about, and magic or the Elements of Harmony are needed to defeat it."

Applejack: "H-Honeybun..!" She clung to me. "A-Ah dunno what that was! But, whatever it was, t'ain't nat-cher-all!" She was STILL quivering.

Golden: "A-aye, suh!" He was trying to be brave, too, but failing.

Broken: "K-K.. th-this is just a-as bad a-as th-the castle!" He was practically hugging the Ratte, clinging to his Grant like it was a mere pointy stick.

K: "Fluttershy?" I nodded to her.

Fluttershy: "..I guess I wasn't close enough to feel it. I'm sorry." She shrugged her wings, and gestured for Golden to come over for a hug. "There, there."

Golden: "A'hm.. sorry.. it's just so scary.." He shuddered. "An' I don't even know why!"

K: "Whatever it is, it doesn't make me afraid, just disgusted." I shrugged.

Applejack: "Skurr'd the apples outta me, fer shure!" She was clinging to me - VERY unlike her.

Broken: "I-I'm having the same problem." He was trying VERY hard to keep it together.

K: "We'll get answers." I nodded.


TIME: 12:33 EET


Our retaking of the town was delayed, so the Reserve Force, made up of the Navarese 1st Division, overtook us to take our place. Equestrian forces were centered on the town. Most of the 2nd line was here. Overall, the offensive had completed the rest of its objectives. We heard from the offensives to the west that the enemy broke and ran at the first sign of armored units. The border was guarded by 3 Tarpangoslavian Mechanized Divisions with tank support. An uneasy ceasefire was in place in those two locations.

I had ordered, under my authority as Supreme Allied Commander, that if the Tarpangoslavians attacked first, NEIGHTO forces could advance and destroy them.. and hold whatever territory they took. I was not going to make similar mistakes as Korea and Vietnam, that is, take territory and destroy the enemy, then withdraw, and invite them to attack again. No, we would take and hold if pressed.

The Elements were all here, as was all of CAG, minus a few (Forest Spirit, Redheart, Saquet and his Legionnaires - all off to the west, commanding the offensives there). We were as together as we could get.

Katrina: "...well, bad news, K." She came up to me, having done some incantations and detection spells. "Something in there is evil, alright. Absolutely negatively aligned." She shrugged. "Also, neither Twilight nor I are detecting signs of life."

Seven Devils: "There were 25,000 foxes in that town!" He snarled.

Twilight Sentry: "Ah.." She lowered her head. "..we can't detect any of them, Seven, I'm so sorry."

Katrina: "On the plus side, we don't detect any Donkeys, either." She shrugged. "I'm not entirely sure why."

K: "Alright. Probe time. Sunset, get the girls together. Twilgiht, you, too. Prime Minister or not, you're one of us, first. Moon Dancer, Katrina, Jade? Gonna need you, too. RADIO ACTIVE!" I called.

Radio: "Yeah?!" She called back from up the line a bit.

K: "GIT YER SHIT, I NEED YOU!" I looked over at Norphy, Gaze, and Cosmic. "You three, too, plus Trixie and Dusk." I nodded.

Twilight: "We going in heavy?" She asked, levitating her Abrams.

K: "Sure are. No chances. We have no idea what this is, or if it can bleed. But, if it can, I want it to bleed FAST." I nodded.

Broken: "What do we do about the.. the.. fear thing?" He gestured, shrugging.

K: "Mmmm." I lowered my head. "Ideas?" I looked at the others.

Katrina: "We-"

Toola Roola: "We laugh!" She cut in.

Rose Pompadour: "YEAH! We giggle at the ghosties!" She giggled.

Twilight Sentry: "Rose, that-" She blinked. "-YEAH!" She nodded to me. "K, trust me, it'll work!"

K: "I gotcha." I smirked. "Let's go. Fan out, watch your sectors, Rose, you have point." I nodded.

Rose: "Darn, tootin', K!" She giggled. "Time for me to pay you all back!" She smiled so widely.

Maud: "My sister has this." She stayed back as the rest of us advanced.

Dusk, Golden, Broken, Cosmic, Norfy, and Gaze all started humming at the same time.


("Giggle at the Ghosties" - Copyright, 2012, Hasbro. Edits by Dreamlander.)

Rose Pompadour (Singing): "When I was a little filly and the sun was going down..."

Trixie Lulamoon: *Bemused* "Tell me she's not..!"

Rose Pompadour (Singing): "The darkness and the shadows, they would always make me frown!"

Rarity Seeker: "She is." She grinned, confidently.

Rose Pompadour (Singing):

"I'd hide under my pillow

From what I thought I saw

But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way

To deal with fears at all..!"


Rainbow Dash: *Confidently* "Then what is?" She grinned at Rose.


Rose Pompadour (Singing):

"She said: "Rosie, you gotta stand up tall

Learn to face your fears

You'll see that they can't hurt you

Just laugh to make them disappear."


The dark wind came across the front of our formation right then, and tried to hit Rose, as she was on point.

Rose Pompadour: "Ha! Ha! Ha!"

As she laughed at the dark wisp of smoke, it vanished!

CAG Team: "Yeah!" We cheered, confidently.


Rose Pompadour (Singing):

"So, giggle at the ghostly!

Guffaw at the grossly!

Crack up at the creepy!

Whoop it up with the weepy!

Chortle at the kooky!

Snortle at the spooky!

And tell that big dumb scary face to take a hike and leave you alone and if he thinks he can scare you then he's got another thing coming and the very idea of such a thing just makes you wanna... *Giggling laughter*

Laaaaaaauuugh!"

And just like that, the fearsome, fear-inducing miasma.. was gone!

K: "I've seen this a dozen times, and I'll never get used to it." I laughed. "Well done, Rose!"

Rose Pompadour: "See? I'm more than just a pretty face!" She giggled back.

With that, we set about exploring the town for whatever evil things were supposed to be here. Despite the war, despite all we'd been through, we smiled. Rose was more than a reflection of Pinkie Pie, she was her own pony with shared experiences, and that made her one of us as much as anything. She was our friend, and as I always say...

Friendship is Magic.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Argeios Offensive - Battle of Ptolemais Pt 2


TIME: 12:44 EET
DATE: War Day 1063/1 Tertious, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Ptolemais, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


With the fear spell broken, now, we advanced into the town. Fanned out, we walked with confidence and purpose. My right arm was still not 100%, but I would have to be on my A-Game otherwise.

Dusk: "..first house, clear. Nothing, no sign of the people." He trotted up with Cosmic and Broken. "Not even a sign of a struggle."

Cosmic: "The furniture and dishes and things are all in place. Like they just vanished." He shrugged.

K: "Keep moving." I nodded. "Check every house as we pass it."

Katrina: "It's very odd." She shook her head. "It doesn't look like they were herded out by military force, it's more like they just vanished."

Twilight Sentry: "It's strange. Teleportation Magic is hard enough - but to make it look like they teleported a whole town? I can only imagine Tirek having that kind of power." She sighed.

Jade: "Maybe we're thinking about this the wrong way." She piped up, moving up to us.

Katrina: "Well, child.. let's hear it." She nodded.

Jade: "Maybe.. they're still here." She pointed at Katrina. "The spells we used to detect life forms, wouldn't detect them, if their matter-state was altered. Would it?"

K: "I'm lost." I shrugged.

Jade: "It's simple, Uncle." She patted my back. "What if they were shifted out of phase with standard states of matter? Removed from this plane, but not killed."

Twilight Sentry: "And.. WHY would someone do that?" She tilted her head.

Sunset: "Preserve them for extraction while creating a very baity trap for, specifically, US?" She pointed to Twilight with her hoof.

Dusk: "Mmm.." He cocked a brow. "Meaning any Macedonkian troops here, were shifted with them, so they could be preserved for later deployment. Someone'll need to guard them, after all." He nodded.

Rarity: "Meaning, darlings, we're dealing with a postively nasty sort of mage with incredible power. We already met ONE, remember? It seems the Macedonkians or Tarpangoslavians have an entire division of their armed forces dedicated to the dark arts." She shook her head, frowning.

Norfy: "This.. actually makes a lot of sense. That's the advantage the Macedonkians wanted and would make sure they had over Vulpines - MAGIC!" He nodded. "Vulpine magic isn't quite on the same caliber of Unicorns, I've seen, among the common fox, but their specialists are.. amazingly strong. I met one in Athens that was specialized in ice magic." He lowered his head with a respectful smile. "He's.. he outclasses me." He shrugged.

Gaze: "Aye. An' if Norf's right.." He wagged a hoof. "Th' Mace'donkians.. they wuz' wantin' conventional parity, an' then magical superiority." He shrugged. "Ti's easier t'train a division o' mages on th' cheap than it is t'squeek out a wee bit more p'formance out'a mechanized weppins, we only started usin' a couple'a years'ago."

Cosmic: "It's also something we understand better." He nodded. "As a.. a global culture. Magic is a part of who we are. Has been since the start of time. Machines? Nah, that's.. something we gain and lose as civilizations rise and fall."

K: "Okay, this is making sense." I nodded. "Now, the question is, who's responsible, and how to we fix this?"

Everyone kinda stared at me blankly. Just because they understood what might be going on here, didn't mean any of them had an immediate answer on how to fix it.

Broken: "Ah.. K?" He stepped up and shrugged. "Maybe the who doesn't matter. The how might be all we need." He nodded.

K: "Makes perfect sense." I nodded. "Well? Twilight? You and the other Mages have a working theory - what can you do?"

Twilight: "We.. can.. start looking at things, start a few detection spells.." She shook her head. "This will take some time."

K: "Right. I'll move a unit into the town for close protection." I nodded. C> "Alpha to Alpha Team."

Luna: C> "Selene Actual, Alpha."

K: "Oh, nice." I smiled. C> "Selene Actual, requesting a hoof platoon for close support."

Luna: C> "Selene Actual is sending Selene Four. How copy?"

K: C> "Copy, Selene." I nodded.

Dusk: "Mmm. My old unit, again." He smiled.

Within minutes, Echo, Astral, and the other Thestrals that made up, officially, 2nd Guard Company, 4th Platoon, arrived.

As soon as they did, though, the other shoe dropped.

Astral: "K! Everyone! GET TO COVER!"

We didn't need an invitation - if someone of her elite status says 'get to cover,' you don't ask why. I found myself roll-diving through a window, and once inside the building, rolling over, and pulling myself up to brace my Grant on the windowsill.

K: "ASTRAL!" I called out, but switched to Coms. C> "Selene Four Actual. SitRep. Over?"

Astral: C> "One second, Alpha. Moving to your poz."

Dusk: "For the recond, K.." He was behind a hasily overturned cart stacked with grain, making improvised sand bags. "..I don't see or hear anything."

Twilight: "I don't FEEL anything, either." She was next to him.

Astral and Echo slipped into the building behind me, and slid right next to me.

Astral: "K.. you.. you need to listen to me." She tugged my shirt.

I turned and gave her my full attention, nodding slowly.

Astral: "I don't know what you know of us, but this is the full truth - we're what Flutter Ponies BECAME, K." She stared straight into my soul with her cat-slit eyes.

K: "..and as such, you have.. something from that, don't you?" I nodded, just ignoring the 'why'/'how' part, for now.

Astral: "We do. We have a couple of legitimate powers, though, as well. Stuff that evolved over the thousands of years we've existed. Whomever is here? Is using Jewel Magic. Jewels - crystals, basically - are very vulnerable to sonic shock. And.. they have a sort of.. vibration to them. That only we can hear." She pointed to the north-north west. "The wizard doing it, is that way." She waved her forelegs around us. "The people? They're here. They're held in a giant gem, phased into a pocket dimension. We.. we can free them.. with a sonic screech. But, the magic used here, is the darkest shadow magic I've ever seen. I can only guess where it came from - fragments of Nightmare Crystal. A gem so rare, so hard to find, but so simple for someone of Tirek's caliber to make? That he HAS to be the one that sent this wizard henchpony here. Or.. hench.. donkey." She shook her head, dismissing the social platitide. "The answer isn't the Elements, K. It's US." She tapped her chest.

K: "I'm trusting you, Astral." I leaned over and hugged her neck. "After Gloom Mountain? How can I not?" I smiled a bit, and leaned out the window. "Twilight, I'm moving ahead with Dusk and 4th Platoon.

Twilight: "Ohh.. let me go with!" She hissed. "At-at.. the very least.. because.." She blushed. "..remember the rule we have about you not going off without someone that's been.. intimate.. with you." She turned red across her muzzle.

K: "Alright, fine." I looked at Sunset, who was behind a small wall. "You're in charge until we get back. Listen to Norfy, Cosmic, and Gaze."

Sunset: "On it, K." She nodded, smiling.

Timber: "I'll keep her head straight, boss." He gave me a hoof's up.

K: "Fourth Platoon! ON ME!" I hopped over the window sill, and advanced, with Dusk and Twilight flanking me.

The Truth Will Out.

Part 4: Argeios Offensive - Battle of Ptolemais Pt 3


TIME: 13:34 EET
DATE: War Day 1063/1 Tertious, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Ptolemais, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


Without being told the situation, Astral Sky figured out everything that had transpired, what was going on here, the second she arrived. Moreso, she figured out who was responsible and where they are. And why.. why? Because, as we found out, Thestrals were the descendants of Flutter Ponies. That, as I surmised, Galactica Spark could not actually kill. She could not genocide. She was still a Pony, and deliberate, malicious mass murder was not something she could ever actually do. Instead, she cursed.

That was a guess.

Now, the fact, was that 4th Platoon and I, with Dusk and Twilight, were heading into towards that evil person, that was doing all of this, so we could attack the source of the missing foxes. And once they were dealt with, we could free them.

It was empty almost the whole way to the city's administration building. Out front were actual Tirek-uniformed troops - Raptorians.

Astral: "Squad and change." She nodded, and motioned for 2nd Squad to move up - they had suppressed weapons. After a second, the Raptorians were dead.

K: "Move in." I nodded, and raised my rifle. "Buffalo the mage, kill them fast." I said as we got to the door.

Astral and 1st Squad kicked the door, hucked in two grenades, and shut the door again, letting the fragmentation grenades do their work. They then popped the door open, and rushed in at full speed. I took position between 1st and 2nd Squad.

Inside, we took fire from the balcony - more Raptorians. I was barely able to get off a single shot before 1st Squad had them dealt with and dead.

Elites indeed.

Astral: "..they're close. Very close." She murmured.

Dusk: "..hm.." He paused, and held up a hoof. "..THERE!" He pressed an energy barrier forwards, and blew part of a wall down, only to reveal a very large male donkey.

Said donkey was once again in a military uniform, his with a black cape and cowl. He's also just standing there, menacingly. Which caused everyone to fire a short burst in his direction, myself included. This... did nothing. The bullets rippled through him.

Astral: "..I know what's up here. COVER YOUR EARS!" She called to me, Twilight, and Dusk.

I did as instructed, ducking behind Echo. Dusk and Twilight did likewise.

Astral: "Everyone! SONIC SCREECH!" She pointed.. roughly in the direction of the donkey.

All of the members of 4th platoon instantly dropped low, reared down, and then forwards...

*RRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeEeEEeEEeEeEEEEeEeeEeEEEEeEEeeeeeeeeEeeeEEEEeeeeEEEeeeeEE*

The sonic waves crashed into the side of the building, echoed off, collided with each other, and filled the room with magical sonic vibration. Even with my ears covered, my head instantly felt pain. I fell over on my side.

Then, the illusion shattered.

The donkey hadn't been standing where we thought, he was, instead, on the balcony above, hiding. His fake projection melted before my eyes, and he cried out in pain, staggering to the railing. Only Astral stopped screeching, and only long enough to put two rounds into his head from her rifle.

Everything grew quiet, after that.. but my head was ringing.

Echo: "General!" She helped me up. "Erghh. His ears, ma'am! He's weaker to this than the others!"

Indeed, the sonic vibration had left me stunned. I could hear, but it was muffled behind a high pitched whine.

Astral: C> "Selene Four Actual to Alpha Two-Nine or Alpha Three-One."

Vinyl Scratch: C> "Alpha Two-Nine. Go."

Astral: C> "Casualty! Meet us at the town square."

Vinyl Scratch: C> "Roger!"

I found myself hefted on Astral's back, when I discovered I couldn't balance well enough to walk. They carried me over their backs the whole way back to the square. The world was swimming, and my brain was racing.. I sure hope this wasn't a brain anyeurism.

Vinyl Scratch: "Boss! K!" She was at my side in a second. "Fluttershy!" She waved her over. "Wh-where's he hit!?"

Dusk: "He's not. Th.. uh.." He pointed to Astral. "They cast a Sonic spell, his ears are damaged from it."

Fluttershy got me down on the ground, and literally used herself as a pillow to keep my head up. I couldn't hear her heartbeat, and I should have. I knew this was.. a.. miscalculation. Still.

Vinyl Scratch: "Ahhhh." She clapped her hooves together (I saw, but did not hear it). "I got this, yeah." She pulled out her head phones and put them over my ears. "Have some soothin' beats, boss." She patted my head.

Using her own magic, that over sound itself, and music, she pumped what amounted to a sound healing spell into my ears. Slowly, I could hear more and more of the song, until I could hear every part. It was just like with Dex and me being too close to the 155mm gun going off, just before Cowrea. After a bit, I sat up, and rubbed my face.

K: "Thanks, Vy." I hugged her. "That was pretty chill stuff.." I handed the headphones back. "..not your usual."

Vinyl Scratch: "Eh, I'm experimentin' - a mare's gotta stay fresh, right?" She chuckled a bit.

Fluttershy: "I hope I was nice and comfortable, K." She hugged me.

K: "Soft as a pillow." I nodded to Golden. "He knows. HE knows!" I pointed at him, and we all had a chuckle.

Golden: "Aw, mate." He blushed a bit.

I sat up, and after a moment to make sure the effect was gone, stood.

K: "Astral." I nodded. "That was flawless." I smiled.

Dusk: "My unit. Sir." He grinned. "I passed it to the right pony."

K: "You did." I nodded back. "Now, Astral, get the people freed. Dusk, Cosmic, Norfy, Gaze, get the team in here and take up positions. We don't know what state the Macedonkians will be when they're broken out, and if they want to resist, I want marksponies read to make some examples, or prevent hostage situations."

Dusk: "We're on it, K." He motioned to the lads, and they took off.

Soon enough, the people - foxes - would be freed. And we would have accomplished the last operation to free Vulpesylvania from the Macedonkians' clutches.

Part 5: Argeios Offensive - Battle of Ptolemais Pt 4


TIME: 14:57 EET
DATE: War Day 1063/1 Tertious, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Ptolemais, Western Argeios, Principality of Vulpesylvania


We were in position everywhere. Not knowing where everyone would reappear was the worst part. The soldiers might all be together, or they might be all over the place. So, we spread everyone over the town as best we could. As preparations were completing, I pulled Astral and Echo aside.

K: "Give me the story." I nodded.

Astral: "Back.. when.. the first cataclysm happened, Galactica Spark was furious - she accused the Flutter Ponies of being responsible for it. Because of Norpheous Breeze." She looked at Colonel Norfy Loconsole. "I.. he's been with us from the start.. but.. most of us know.. he's him." She reached out a bit to him - his back was turned, and he was giving instructions. "I don't.. blame him, you know?" She looked back to me. "According to our legend, after Norpheous caused the cataclysm to split the ley lines as it did, Galactica Spark came to the Flutter Ponies, and... she was enraged. She was furious that 'we' and our power caused that. But, she could not kill us - Filly Luna stepped in!" She giggled a bit, as Luna stepped up. "Ah, Princess!"

Luna: "Do not let me interrupt." She slid a wing over me. "It is important that the Moon's Lover.. know." She nodded to Astral.. as I used her wing for cover while I slid a palm over her flank - making her smile a bit.

Astral: "Well.. Luna.. begged her mother not to kill us all. In return, her mother made us her responsibility. She cursed us. Instead of being happy ponies of rainbow and light, we were forced into the darkness, into the shadows." She looked at Luna and smiled. "Ever since, Thestrals - Bat Ponies - have worshipped Luna over Celestia, even after the Nightmare Moon incident." She looked at me. "We knew the truth about that, too - which you exposed years ago."

K: "That the past history isn't what we were taught - that Celestia had become a Despot, and Luna had stood against her, and only her crushing regret for sending her sister to the moon for a thosuand years, snapped her out of it." I shrugged, summing it up. "And, somehow, Discord was involved as well, as their front man, until they made their presence known, by toppling the current King and Queen. That led to the division of pony society - the military commander, being a Pegasus, the civilian leader, the Chancellor, being and Earth Pony, and the daughter of the King and Queen, a Princess, was a Unicorn." I gestured. "Before her parents were eliminated by Celestia - that is, killed - she and the others took part in the Migration Event, and defeating the Windigoes. And Celestia kinda.. forced the rest of the population to follow them, after killing the King and Queen. As we know, now, that King and Queen referred to, was the Old Kingdom of Harmony. Which fell into disharmony towards the end, and the Winter of Hard Feelings began.. leading to the founding of Modern Equestria. The truth being that Celestia forced the unification of the races by eliminating certain key figures around that time - the King and Queen included - and after the Founding Six arrived in the area around what's now Canterlot, she stepped in and forced them to cooperate, the Windigoes being a mere excuse, since they were trapped in the far north."

Luna: "Indeed. And as the ponies gathered in this new land, my sister and I realized that the Winters of Hard Feelings were, in fact, a global climate pattern change. Not just negative emotion." She shrugged her wings. "It made the northern areas around the Empire of Harmony cold, naturally, but the negative emotions were a driving factor of it happening so fast. We never did find out exactly WHY these negative emotions caused THAT MUCH upheaval." She shook her head. "But, yes, my sister became a despot once she forced ponies to work and live together, to the point of forcing intermarriage." She looked down and away. "Which is why I took thr old Princess Wands and crafted the Elements of Harmony from them. I had hoped I never would need to use them. Then, Celestia stole them from me. When I went to confront her about her actions, I had managed to obtain the powers of the Selene Gem, giving me the ability to become Nightmare Moon. I did not realize how this would.. affect my mood. That instead of just wanting Celestia to stop, I would start to desire power myself. Neither of us is exactly sure what happened at the confrontation, other than I lost, and Celestia used the stolen Elements of Harmony to banish me to the moon.."

K: "And after that, she realized what she just did, and it crushed her. It snapped her out of her delusions, and she ceased to be a Despot after that. But, these events were drawn out over a period of about two hundred years." I shrugged.

Luna: "And during that time, ponies that questioned the truth, vanished. Her garden has many fine statues." She lowered her head. "But, the Thestrals are my ponies." She nuzzled Astral. "I can sense them, when they are close. They pray to me. Even when I was imprisoned on the moon, I could hear them." She nodded to Astral. "I found it funny that, when my guard unit was reconstituted, so many of you made the effort to join it."

K: "Well, to be fair, they had a small platoon-sized ceremonial unit before I started rearming the country." I shrugged.

Astral: "We've always seen it as a sort of holy duty, to skirt by, trick the sun that deprived us of our moon, and slide up right next to her. Infiltrate her guard." She smirked. "How long have we served together, Dusk?"

Dusk: "A long time." He nodded.

Cosmic: "We're all ready, K." He nodded to Luna. "Your Higness, I think you should depart." He shrugged. "You ARE with foal." He smirked at Dusk and me.

We both kinda blushed.

K: "Get going, honey." I kissed her muzzle. "We'll spend some time together, later. Just us." I hugged her neck.

Luna: "As you wish, MY General." She gently slapped my ass wih her tail as she turned and departed.

Dusk: "..I will never forget that night." He said, smiling.

K: "I'll never forget that you're giving me and Luna a child of our own." I nodded. "Get to your place." I pointed, and took the safety off of my Grant, as I moved to my spot.

Astral: "Fourth Platoon! GET READY!" She called out, as she moved to her spot.

We had all the Thestrals carefully sorted in the town - when they released their Sonic Screech, the vibrations would cover most all of the town, and reverborate, to shatter the spell.

K: C> "K to Team - Ear Pro, now!" I said, sticking ear plugs in, and securing my radio headset tighter.

The Sonic Screech echoed across the town. This was a less harsh, more harmonic screech. Like a Bat version of a group Utter Flutter. They were in tune - I can only guess that they'd practiced.

The illusion shattered like glass. Fortuitously, all of the civilians appeared to be in their homes.

Unfortuitously, the Macedonkians were in the streets.

Macedonkian Officer: "Otvoren ogan!"

K: "LET'EM HAVE IT!" I yelled, and just pulled the trigger.

Both sides started shooting at the same instant. The Macedonkians had little cover, we had more cover, and almost none of our people were out in the open. Those few that were, immediately got cover fire from others, so they could reposition.

The Macedonkians were spread out in clusters, telling me they probably had no idea what was going on - typical.

Dusty was right next to me, shovelling grenades into her Gavin as fast as she could. Her hits were all on the mark - she bounced the timed fuse grenades, and dropped the impact grenades right in clusters of troops. I was banging away with my Grant, and while my selector was on full auto, I was being careful to hit only one or two shot bursts.

After a good four minutes of shooting, the return fire died down. Soon after that, it ceased completely.

K: "ALPHA TEAM! SWEEP AND CLEAR! ALL UNITS, ASSIST!" I called out. "If they surrender, give them quarter!" I instructed.

And so, the battle to retake the last major town in Vulpesylvania was at its end. I was seriously aching in my right arm, but I was alright. Everyone else made it through with no injury, or very slight wounds. Vigilance was being bandaged by Colgate, and he just held up his free foreleg, and waved at me. He'd have more Purple Horseshoes than anyone, after the war was over.

Dusk: "We got the town, K." He stepped up with Astral. "Thanks to our friends."

Astral: "In service to our Immortal Princess of the Moon." She bowed a bit, smiling.

K: "Alright, clean it up. I'm stepping back." I shrugged a bit. "Now, we have to prepare to 'volunteer' for Vulpesylvanian Service." I smiled.

It was over. Vulpesylvania was freed. Now, we could focus on taking out the second Rainbow Factory, and retaking Vulpesylvanian lands long since invaded and annexed.

The day of Tirek's defeat grew ever nearer - and just like Dusk said, it was all because of our friends.

And friendship.. is magic!
