Chapter 124: Ambleonian Adventure (I)

Part 1: Embarking for the future

TIME: 04:21 ERDT
DATE: War Day 977/8 Lunaris 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Manehattan Naval Yard, Manehattan, Erie, Equestria


We were preparing to embark on HMS Weather Rock, which would be my Flagship for this campaign.

Campaign.. we knew we were going to Ambleion, but not where, after that. So, I put together a proper Naval force. The Zephyr Carrier Battle Group and the Weather Rock Battleship Battle Group. That's a Carrier, a Battleship, 6 Cruisers, 2 Destroyers, and 2 Frigates.

If we needed Marines, two Haltimer County-class Landing Ships would be ready to go at a moment's notice. Plus, the ships that could carry Marines, were doing so. My wonderful friend...

Tankette Blinda: "K." She nodded, smirking. "Another little excursion?"

K: "Yeah." I nodded. "We've come a long way. Let the Marines know they'll be cross-training with the Ambleonians.. but we'll have a few days off around New Year's."

Golden: "Be nice t'go home." He smiled a bit. "Git me Bluey."

K: "Bluey?" I asked.

Golden: "Aye! Me lil' pup. Left'm wi' a friend." He shrugged.

Fluttershy: "Oooh! What kind of dog is he?" She blinked, flapping up to the upper deck by the two 11mm emplacements.

Golden: "Trailian Shepherd." He nodded.

Given that there's no "Australia" here, and Yorkshire seems to have culturally replaced it, I wasn't surprised that names changed.

Blinda: "Say, Rarity's pregnant, right?" She tilted her head.

K: "Yeah. She should be staying here, but she's not." I nodded. "At end of the month, Luna is.." I smirked. "..she's taking the baby and gestating it along with the baby that Dusk seeded in my name."

Blinda: "You never did tell anyone how that went." She leaned in, smirking.

K: "Yeah, and.. I won't." I smirked back at her, and ruffled her cheeks. "Sorry, you may be like a sister to me, AND a Marine, but Dusk asked that I keep quiet about it."

Fluttershy: "I mean.. it's probably.. VERY romantic to.." She blushed. "..have a crush like that.." And blushed harder. "..and it actually work out." And she made a tiny squee.

I saw Golden just about melt.

Well, I don't need Jackie's help to see THAT one.

Blinda: "Heh. Yeap." She smirked.. and noticed Golden completely distracted. She just rolled her eyes at me and stepped away to the Bridge.

Trixie: "..can Trixie come out, now?" She just about mewled.

Her confidence was not back, yet. Actually, I had to intervene a couple of days ago, when Written Script went off on her.

We were trying to bring her back into the greater herd that was Equestria, but some were not as forgiving. Some that had lost friends. Dear friends.

I wasn't even trying to imagine how I'd have to get in between her and Diashiro. He'd literally want her head.

K: "Come on, you." I patted her shoulder. "Let's get you settled in the CAG Quarters."

Down there, of course, Dusk was making sure our private arms room was ship-shape.

Trixie: "..ah. Uh. Hello." She bowed to him. "Sorry I haven't.. been.." She gestured a bit. "..thank you for standing up for me."

Dusk: "I lost friends because of Evil Trixie. You're not her." He turned to face her. "You don't deserve to be treated like her." He noticed Rose Pompadour coming in. "Perfect example." He nodded to her.

Rose: "Hey, Trixie!" She scooted right up to her.

Trixie: "You.. look like.. Pinkie Pie. Where IS Pinkie Pie?" She tilted her head.

Rose: "I came from the Mirror Pool, but I became my own pony." She shrugged. "Pinkie stole Discord's power and went to another dimension so she couldn't hurt us."

Trixie: "..oh." She blinked. "She sacrificed herself." And shrugged a bit. "But you.."

Rose: "I'm not the same as Pinkie. I mean, I kinda am - I love having friends, and I LOVE throwing PARTIES!" She beamed a grin.

K: "She doesn't have Pinkie's mystery powers." I shrugged.

Trixie: "Ah.." She nodded a little. "..uhm.." She nervously pulled her little satchel over her shoulder. "..where should I bunk?"

K: "Rose? You mind?" I tilted my head at her.

Rose: "Not at all!" She hummed and swished her twintails back and forth a bit. "Set her up with me, K!"

K: "Come on, this way." I gestured to the area with the sleeping quarters and led her there.

Trixie: "..I'm still having a hard time trying to.." She said in low tones. "..the other me did terrible things." She sighed.

K: "She did." I nodded, caressing her cheek in comfort.

Trixie: "..that's really nice." She blushed a bit. "But, you're.. married.. and you have a big Stable as it is." She cowered a bit.

K: "I get it." I shrugged. "Besides.." I gestured.

Trixie: "I-I didn't!" She blushed in humiliation, this time.

K: "Yeah, it was right after you made me eat the roasted foa-" I stopped myself. "-sorry, I didn't.. I wasn't going to say anythin-"

Trixie: "I was a monster!" She cowered under her bunk and started crying.

Dusk: "Eh?" He stepped in, and saw her crying. He just.. slid under there with her and hugged on her a bit. "That. Wasn't. You."

Trixie: "Bu-but.. I.." She looked at her hooves. "It means I could be.. I could DO that.. I.." She sniffled.

Dusk: "No. Not now. Not now that you see the darkness that was there. You have a choice. You can change the future, your future, now." He said, softly, but firmly.

K: "Rose, I expect you and the others to train her as a soldier while we're on the voyage. It'll be six days to get there." I nodded.

Rose: "You got it, K." She nodded with a grin.

K: "You know, Dusk, you're now 6th in line, right?" I nodded to him. "To command CAG."

Dusk: "Forest Spirit, Tankette Blinda, Norfy, Gaze, and Cosmic are all ahead of me." He nodded. "What about Chemical Lens?"

K: "Situational." I shrugged. "In open combat, it'd be you. If it's a law enforcement action, her. She's a Sheriff, that's equal to a Colonel. But she's also Marshal of the Royal Court. Technically, Twilight could take command if she wanted, but I don't think she would, over you."

Dusk: "Huh." He nodded. "And with Norfy, Gaze, Cosmic, Forest Spirit, and Blinda usually performing a strategic command role..." He tilted his head. "..effectively, I'm second field commander, now."

K: "Yup. Especially for this leg of the mission - Blinda's here, but she'll be busy with her Marines." I nodded. "Just keep that in mind." I looked at AJ. "The girls have no rank - that's intentional. If the solution is magical, chances are, I have to be there with them. I need.." I looked back to him. "..someone at my side that can cover me, like you did in Sumatra."

Dusk: "I get it." He smiled a bit, then nodded to the side. "And with my former billet being Planning and Training Staff Officer, I'm also Chief Instructor."

K: "Yeah." I nodded to Trixie. "Make her decent."

Trixie: "Ah." She smiled just a bit. "Do you think I can?"

Dusk: "Give it time." He nodded back. "Get your gear put up and we'll go to the fantail and do some basic practice."

Trixie: "Alright." She frowned just a bit.

Rose: "I'll be RIGHT there WITH you!" She smiled broadly, and gave her a half-hug.

K: "We disembark at dawn." I nodded.

Dusk: "I understand." He nodded back, and looked around a bit, before grabbing a couple manuals.

Pressures of command.. he WOULD be second-in-command for this part of the mission, effectively.

Trixie: "Tell me.." She looked at me, with a touch of a twinkle in her eye. "..what weapon does Twilight prefer?"

K: "She was our Machine Gunner for the longest time. Abrams." I nodded.

Trixie: "Dusk." She squared herself up a bit. "I wish to train with that." She blinked, and let a tiny smile come. "After all, I can't get back to being Great and Powerful until I prove I'm as good as Twilight was at SOMEthing."

Dusk: "Alright. Machine gunning is a two-part skill.." He trailed off. "..and if you're going to be the Machine Gunner for the main six girls, too, you need to know the 11mm, too."

Trixie: "I can do it." She nodded. "I MUST do it."

Dusk: "I'll whip you into some kind of shape, then." He smirked a bit.

At dawn, we set off. We planned to head there at a fairly slow speed, partly so we didn't burn a ton of coal. The one GOOD thing about this world was the high quality, high temperature-burning coal available in high quantity.

Six days. And the cruise was routine the whole way. Dusk spent his time with Rose and Trixie, training them both in proper Soldiering. It wasn't easy. Rose was as chaotic as Pinkie had once been, but without the 4th wall ToonForce stuff. She took guns seriously, but she liked to play about when they weren't in play. Trixie just plain lacked confidence, right now.

After six days, though, Dusk had most of the CAG newcomers trained or re-trained as well as he could with the basic tools at hand. Broken and Golden already had most of this under their belt, as it is. Just not Equestrian Ranger/Royal Guard style. Moon Dancer, Trixie and Rose were kinda starting from scratch - Trixie especially. Dancer was having some trouble with endurance, but that was to be expected - she was NOT in the best of shape to start with.

Bless her, though, she was trying her absolute best to keep up with us. And it was funny to see Trixie cheering her on.

However, interestingly, Trixie took rather well to the training. I was a bit surprised. Within a few days of being shown that she COULD do it, she stopped slinking around the CAG quarters like a scared cat. By the time we reached Ambleon, she wasn't exactly back to her old self, but she felt comfortable with the girls. Rose had grown to be her new best friend, of all things.

Sunset told me all of this over dinner the night before we arrived, after we met up with our Honor Guard Escort - HMAS Cirencester, Cavendish, and Harding.

The Ambleonian General Staff Office had been alerted to our needs, and we'd be met in Londinium by Prince Blueblood and a cadre to take us anywhere we needed to go. Princess Margaret had also cleared us to get anything we needed - even "restricted" materials - and sent orders specifically for Broken and Golden that they'd be operating under the Princess' Own Authority - in short, nopony loyal to the Princess could rightly refuse a proper order from them, no matter what they think of it.

I just hoped we'd get some information. We needed it. Anything.

Part 2: Waved Reception

TIME: 09:21 Greenwich Mean Time
DATE: War Day 983/14 Lunaris 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Bridge of HMS Weather Rock, 12 nmi from the mouth of the River Thames, Ambleonian Territorial Waters

We were exactly 13km north of the town of Herne Bay, just entering the outer reaches of the River Thames. I was a bit excited to see the city, I had to admit. London was one of the many places I'd wanted to see as a kid, before the progression of time had ruined it.

VADM Whitecap: "We'll be in Londinium by noon, sir." He nodded.

K: "Good. I'm eager to see what our Ambleonian Allies are like, up close. I've never been here, before." I shrugged.

Whitecap: "Me, neither, sir." He smirked. "Kinda hard to believe it's been almost two years since Neighpon."

K: "Yeah, well." I shrugged. "War can move very fast, or very slow. A lot of the early days of it was both sides realizing the other guy was tougher than they'd thought. Now, adaptations are coming down the pipe on a monthly basis."

Capt. Northern Star: "And some of us have gotten better over the years." She shrugged.

K: "I've heard only good things since, Northern." I nodded to her.

PO1 Oarbis: "..Captain, Cirencester is signalling." He paused. "Sonar contact, bearing zero-three-five relative! It's not friendly!"

VADM Whitecap: "Sound battle stations." He said, calmly. "Steer us away from it, bearing two-one-zero. Have Bucker come over to cover us. Sonar, what've we got?"

PO2 Longears: "..I have the sonar contact reported by Cirencester.. and one more, bearing two-two zero and closing.." He paused. "..TORPEDO CONTACT, TWO-TWO-ZERO! RANGE, ONE-SEVEN HUNDRED!"

Capt. Northern Star: "HARD OVER! HARD OVER! BEARING ZERO-THREE-FIVE! PULL THAT WHEEL, SAILOR!"

We didn't have time to turn directly INTO the Torpedo spread, the best we could do, was try to get alongside it within its aimed direction. Which would take us directly towards the second submarine.

Crafty. They'd pinned us against the shore on either side, and were attacking from two nearly-identical relative directions.

VADM Whitecap: "Order Zephyr to turn seaward! Have Mudbriar and Braeburn cover! Get Martingalier and Sacramento on that sub at Two-Two-Zero!"

PO1 Oarbis: "Cirencester and her escorts are engaging the enemy submarine ahead of us, with depth charges." He reported.

VADM Whitecap: "NO! Have them abort and come about to Two-Two-Zero or Zero-Three-Five! The torpedoes behind us-"

PO2 Longears: "Torpedoes approaching! Impact in five!"

PO1 Oarbis: C> "CIRENCESTER, ABORT RUN, INCOMING TORPEDOES FROM TWO-TWO ZERO RELATIVE!"

Capt. Northern Star: "..they're going to skim us! DO NOT MOVE THAT WHEEL!" She ordered the helmspony, looking out from the bridge, and behind us, with binoculars.

I was looking straight ahead as the wakes of the torpedoes passed us. Cirencester had started her turn, and was almost aimed right at us, but I watched her just barely weave through the expanding torpedo spread. Harding was following her, and Cavendish was attempting a turn in the other direction.

A torpedo tagged Cavendish almost dead center. I saw her immediately stop.

Capt. Northern Star: "ALL STOP! ALL STOP! Or we'll run right into her!" She shouted to the navigation crew.

Cavendish also fired her Y-Gun depth charge throwers at the same instant, as she was bearing down on the other submarine. Her captain had tried something risky, and was about to pay the price for it.

K: "Cavendish is about to sink-" I stared, as her own depth charges went off not that far beneath her, nor terribly far distant. I watched her fantail get lifted out of the water.. but her forward section stay in it. She was cracked in half. "-ready lifeboats!" I finished.

Cirencester and Harding slipped past us. At the same time, I saw the enemy sub at Zero-Three-Five, that had just been hit by the now mortally wounded Cavendish, surface.

Mortal wound or no, her forward twin 4.7-inch guns swung on target, along with her starboard side Vickers 40, and immediately open fire.

The Submarine detonated as a pair of 4.7-inch shells hit just below the "sail."

I moved to the Bridge Wing to look behind us. Two Fairy G.2 Pintails were in the air - Cirencester's - and were diving on a position about 800 meters to her port quarter. I watched them release their four 120kg depth charges, and pull up at the last second, in a line.

All four depth charges exploded, one right after the other, and produced an immediate oil slick. Harding cut in from behind Cirencester, and ran a line of depth charges over the oil slick herself, just to be sure. When those went off, the oil slick got bigger.

Capt. Northern Star: "..General, Sonar reports no enemy submarine contacts."

K: "Have us resume formation.. and get Cavendish some help!" I pointed, even though Weather Rock's 10-meter launch was already in the water and heading over there.

TIME: 11:22 GMT

All in all, Cavendish suffered 22 casualties, of which, 6 were killed immediately and 1 died of wounds later. She was broken in half, with 18 meters of aft section blown away, along with her propellers, but her Captain managed to seal off the aft section with watertight doors, and maintained the rest of the ship afloat, despite the hole in her side.

She was rigged for towing. HMS Briareus and HMS Bucker undertook the task, and were trailing behind us at a mere 6 knots. Despite her "mortal wound," Cavendish was so close to Home Port and just barely afloat enough for us to attempt this. Londinium was sending out several Harbor Tugs to assist, and would meet us half way.

VADM Whitecap: "..they'll probably scuttle her anyway." He shrugged.

K: "Maybe. That stern section being lost like that.." I shook my head. "..and everyone back there that wasn't killed was evacuated before it went under. That captain needs a promotion and I'm going to suggest it." I nodded.

VADM Whitecap: "Cirencester certainly proved that depth charge drops from scout planes are effective. It.. was pretty tight, though." He shrugged.

K: "Most of our naval combat has been at the equivalent of knife fighting range. Really, engagements should be at a kilometer or more." I gestured.

A flyover of five Pintails smoking out Equestrian colors, greeted us as we got to the edge of the harbor area. I could see that this Londinium - or, London on Earth - had, indeed, Big Ben and the castle. The whole "City of London" thing. The rest of the skyline looked like 1890's London or so. Maybe early 1900's. I knew the population was about 2 million, making it one of the largest cities in Europe.

It was also just a bit foggy.

I smiled. I'd get to see "London" at close to its cultural peak. This pleased me. This was also my first official visit. I'd visited Paris and Marelin. I'd also like to visit Roam, eventually.

I felt Applejack's foreleg slide around my waist, and I looked down at her with a grin. She had a sassy look on her face.

Applejack: "Anythin' fun t'do here?" She tilted her head. "In case we git some ex'ter time'n'all."

K: "I'm sure I can find something." I smiled.

Broken: "Oh, sorry, ahm I interruptin'?" He poked his head up from the stairs leading to the deck below.

Applejack: "Y'all're fine, Broken. Come on up." She leaned against one of the 11mm mounts, enjoying the view.

Broken: "Ah, Londinium." He beamed a big grin. "Only been here once. Di'n't git to see much. Now? Now this is a view."

K: "Nice, huh?" I smirked. "This war and CAG isn't just about fighting nasty wizards. Every now and then, we get to enjoy ourselves."

Gaze: "OI! Ah had'ta' see this fer meself!" He trotted up from the deck below, behind Broken, and leaned out over the railing, taking in the whole view. "Ah never'd been'tae Londinium b'fer."

Lyra: "Me neither, honey. Y'takes me t'the best places." She sidled up next to her Stallion, and rest her head on his neck. Gaze blushed.

K: "It's a great view." I nodded. "We'll be making port at Deptford Dock, but we'll have to take a smaller vessel in - the larger ships will have to dock at Tilbury Fort, coming up here." I pointed. "We'll transfer to the Braeburn, here in a bit." I nodded.

And, soon enough, we'd be on shore, and heading for the center of London. As mechanized vehicles were becoming a thing, now, the English had invented something more closer to a car and less like a military vehicle, for staff use. They called it the Hillcolt Tilly. Everyone from CAG had piled in to them.

Next: Meeting Princess Margaret on her home turf.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Royal Tea

TIME: 12:17 GMT
DATE: War Day 983/14 Lunaris 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Buckingham Palace, Londinium, Ambleon

Now, to those who have seen me use the term "Ambleion" and "Ambleon" and "Ambleonian" almost equally, I want to point out a point of etiquette. On Earth, we would call this place The United Kingdom of Great Britain (for short). Within that is England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and the Isle of Man. "Ambleon" is the official title for the entity that directly replaces England. "Ambleion" is the same as saying "The UK" or "Great Britain." The enunciation of "Ambleon" is "Amble On" and "Ambleion" is "Am-blee-on." As with the UK, the terms are used fairly interchangably, especially in casual speech.

As it is, the place adopted the name from East Amblia after its merger with the Mercyian kingdoms. Sometimes, locals will refer to this, by calling this place "Mercy." Such as when saying "By Mercy's Sake" or "Mercyan Lands" or similar. It would be no different than applying one of England's various nicknames in casual speech.

For the record, the Government of the Kingdom of Ambleion prefers the term "Ambleion."

We were all escorted inside by the Royal Horse Guards Regiment, and then by attendants.. as expected, both Golden and Broken were a bit nervous, and in full formal uniform. I was in my Class-A's. Black military "Ike Jacket," black slacks, white shirt, black tie, with combat boots, and pistol belt. Not my formals, but Rarity's personal "Commander in Chief" design.

Princess Margaret's office was a very large thing - about as large as Celestia's private study. She was attended-to by Prime Minister, The Lord Rockingham. Interestingly, his full birth name is Rosedale Byluck Rockingham. He's a Unicorn of refinement, one can tell, but the kind of refinement that came with polishing a stone that started off a bit rough.

To be honest, he reminded me of a cross between Lord Halifax and Winston Churchill from 1940. He had the refinement of Lord Halifax, but the general look and experience of Churchill.

Rockingham: "General K!" He bowed sharply. "And your staff."

K: "Lord Rockingham." I nod-bowed to him a bit. "Princess Margaret!" I smiled, and bowed to her.

Princess Margaret: "Oh! K!" She beamed a grin and came from behind her desk, right over to me. "Come come, we must have tea! Rocky, get us some tea, would you?" She saw the rest of my staff - some - were a bit nervous, and gestured them over to the couches and chairs off to the side, around a table. "Come along!" She smiled.

Dusk: "Your Majesty." He bowed as well.

Broken: "Ah-er." He bowed deeply. "Your Majesty."

Golden: "Your Majesty!" He also bowed.

Twilight: "Princess Margaret. A pleasure." She smiled.

Applejack: "Ma'am." She nodded to her.

Lord Rockingham: "Tea, coming right up." He nodded, and called to one of the attendants.

Princess Margaret: "Oh, yes!" She scooted back over to her desk, and fetched a pair of envelopes, returning and personally handing them to Golden Wattle and Broken Dawn. "Your official commissions, Gentlecolts. The Crown hereby recognizes General K's emergency promotions as permanent."

Broken: "Ah-er-eh.. i-it's an honour to serve, Your Majesty." He bowed as he accepted the letter.

Golden: "Aye, Your Majesty." He bowed as well.

K: "They're worth it, Princess." I said, addressing her far more informally, as Lord Rockingham brought in the tea, with a pair of attendants.

I noted immediately that Ambleonian Royal Culture was far more formal than Celestia's. I suppose it fit - Equestria was more like the United States in many ways.

Princess Margaret: "So. I understand from communiques that you need unrestricted access to Princess College's Royal Archives and various secret vaults.." She said, sitting, and pouring our tea for us.

She was literally being Mother. And any English/Anglo readers will get this reference. She poured mine first, then Applejack's, then Twilight's, then down the line in order of sitting.

Twilight: "Yes, Princess Margaret." She nodded.

Moon Dancer: "I'm.. kind of excited.. Your Higness." She was blushing. "I've transcribed for the Royal Archive a couple of times.." She muttered under her breath: "..they always paid very well."

Trixie: "I-I, too, am eager. I.. hear they're.. very expansive!" She was struggling to put up a brave front.

Broken: "Jes' th' chance to see it.." He trailed off. "..I was an Assistant Professor of Philosophy there." He nodded to Lord Rockingham. "His Lordship's good friend, The Viscount Margleberry, had employed me privately a couple of times."

Lord Rockingham: "Mm! I thought I recognized you, sir!" He nodded to Broken, with a grin. "Were you not the one that spoke on the philiosophy of friendship as a grander concept.. oh.. four summers ago, wasn't it?"

Broken: "Aye-yes.. sir." He blinked, somewhat shocked he'd be remembered.

K: "..oh, really?" I turned to look at Broken. "Care to summarize?"

I put him on the spot.

Broken: "Ah-well.. I'd.. discovered some ref'rences back then t' the ancient past and how friendship was used t' build bridges between various races outside'a Ponydom." He blinked. "An' how that could be very important to the greater survival of our species." He was getting into his element. "In short, I theorized, that friendship is a force that we can all feel. Something that transcends the boundaries of class and economics. Something that goes beyond the bounds of our earthly selves, and has this.. force behind it.. that empowers us on a macro and micro scale. Given General K's findings derring the war, I feel vindicated in mah earlier thoughts on the matter. That we have noticed that when the Bonds of Friendship weaken and wither, that our whole species suffers, until somethin' comes along to remind us of this impermiable, indomitable link between all ponykind. Often far too late and with disasterous result. It has been the thought of mine that there is some reason behind why this occurs. Knowing now of the previous civilizations and some of their minutae, I can reflect on our own society the last thousand years and see that our own bonds have started to grow thin. That Princess Celestia herself had to send her best students to rediscover this magic tells me that there is.. some.. invisible miasma'h somewhere in ourselves that we must overcome. The Trixie Paradox. A fine example. That we push others away for a perceived or real slieght, instead of addressin' the core reason for it an' welcoming them in." He held up his tea cup. "This in itself represents a bond between and beyond the rigidity of society - that Her Royal Highness would pour tea for a simple Cornet or Second L'ef'tenant.. or enlisted.." He nodded to Olivine. "..is a reflection that friendship and its bonds CAN exist between even the highest and lowest, and that this is our very nature, as Ponies." He nodded to me. "And General K. Our fearless, brave, committed leader of NEIGHTO. Even in his world, where he freely admits that these bonds are not nearly so strong, when he came here, he was immediately infected, shall we say, by those bonds, and committed his very lifesblood to the cause of its preservation." He nodded. "Your Majesty, I fully and wholeheartedly believe that we as a species have somethin' very special with the Magic of Friendship, and it should be our duty as sentient ponies to preserve these bonds, lest we fall to ruin."

Everyone was silent, looking at him. He immediately blushed.

Princess Margaret: "..oh! Very insightful." She nodded. "I concur."

Broken: "Oh! Thank you, Your Majesty!" He was blushing, but smiling.

K: "So, may we?" I tilted my head.

Princess Margaret: "Of course!" She beamed me a grin.

K: "One other matter, Princess Margaret. The Captain of HMAS Cavendish did an exemplary job of destroying an enemy subamrine and protecting my flagship. They deserve recognition." I nodded to her.

Princess Margaret: "Oh! I had heard there was a little danger you encountered." She nodded. "Rocky, see to it that the Captain of Cavendish is brought before me at their earliest convenience." She smiled a bit.

K: "Is there a good Chip shop nearby?" I asked. "I'd like to get a good lunch." I nodded.

One of the attendants cleared his throat.

Lord Rockingham: "Yes?" He said, leaning towards him a bit.

Attendant: "Head up The Mall to Marlborough, straight up to the end of the road, at the corner, is a pub frequented by Guards and Staff, sires and ladies." He nodded a bit. "Ask for Dumfries. He'll handle you smartly."

K: "Oh, good, it's on the way to the College." I blinked. "Having never been to Londinium, much, could we get an escort?"

Princess Margaret: "Of course!" She nodded, smiling. "I'll assign you Sergeant Keating. He's one of the House Guards. I understand he's from this city and more a commonpony than us." She shrugged a bit.

Attendant: "I shall fetch him, Your Highness." He nodded and trotted off, very proper.

Lord Rockingham: "I'd offer, but, I'm more of a Gentlecolts Club stallion, myself." He nodded to us.

K: "I grew up with a taste of those above me, but a class below." I shrugged very slightly. "I've been on the lowest ends of things, before. I rather prefer the food and decorum of the commonpony." I nodded.

Princess Margaret: "Oh, I do understand!" She smiled. "I've become rather addicted to driving my own Tilly about, myself, ever since they've become a thing. I can FINALLY take little jaunts out to the hills and walk about without a whole caravan following me."

A rather rough-faced (though 'clean shaven' as far as Ponies go), stocky, squared off House Guards Sergeant (an OR-07) stepped up to the door with a measured march, and nodded.

Sgt. Keating: "Sergeant Whitefields Keating reporting as ordered, Your Royal Highness." And he bowed.

K: "None of that." I nodded to him. "You're working for me, temporarily." I stood and walked over to him. "I'm K. Just K. Can I call you White?"

Sgt. Keating: "Er.. I suppose, sir." He nodded.

K: "No, no, no. No 'sir' stuff." I patted his shoulder. "Just K."

Sgt. Keating: "Alright, K." He nodded, firmly, looked me in the eye, and grinned. He had a distinct East London accent. "What may I do for you?"

K: "We'd like to eat. Real food." I nodded firmly. "I was told there's a decent pub about. Dumfries works there. You know it?"

Sgt. Keating: "Yes, si- Yes, K, I do. I get a pint there after work." He smirked a bit. "Good food."

K: "Care to show us the way?" I gestured. "After lunch, we're going to Princess College, too. And.. JUST because we often encounter trouble, please draw a long arm of your preference and a basic ammo load." I shrugged. "We DID encounter a pair of submarines, this morning."

Sgt. Keating: "Of course!" He nodded. "Be just a moment."

K: "We'll meet you in the main hall." I nodded. "Princess Margaret, we will report back to you if we find anything interesting."

Princess Margaret: "Splendid, K. And.. Welcome to Ambleion." She smiled at us.

Now.. lunch. Then, answers. I hoped.

Part 4: Londinium Clubbing

TIME: 13:00 GMT
DATE: War Day 983/14 Lunaris 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: 51 Pall Mall, Londinium, Ambleon

The Pub didn't have a proper name. It was just "The Guard's Pub" or "The Pub on Pall Mall." Dumfries was a big guy like Keating, but very much a working class colt. Older, too, probably in his mid-50's.

Gaze was already right at home, and he was dragging Golden (with no argument) and Broken (with a bit of resistance) right over to the bar. Lyra, giddily, followed. They agreed to split one pint between them - and I agreed it was okay. Remember my rule about booze and guns. One pint split between four ponies with a heavy lunch should be just fine.

After all, I've seen AJ down three pints of Cider and still be able to perform perfectly.

Dumfries: "An' what'd'ju wont, mayte?" He nodded to me.

K: "Fish and chips. And a Ploughcolt's Lunch." I nodded. "With tea. No pint for me, thanks." I don't drink AT ALL, soo..

Applejack: "Same as mah husband." She scooted right next to me.

Dusty: "Same as her husband." She scooted to the other side.

Dumfries: "Aw, mayte! Ye got a pair, eh?" He beamed a grin at me.

Sunset: "Oh, he has a couple MORE.. 'mate.'" She smirked, sitting at our table.

Steela: "Indeed." She scooted to the other side, and just like that, I was surrounded.

Dumfries' grin grew even WIDER seeing Steela and Sunset. He gave me a nod.

Dumfries: "Fish'n'Chips'n'a Ploughcolt all 'round, then?" He nodded.

Steela: "Ja. Und one pint for us three." She indicated AJ, Sunset, and herself. "Tea besides."

Dumfries: "Com'n'up, lass!" He chortled HARD and walked to the back, having gotten everyone's orders.

Gaze, Lyra, Keating, Broken, and Golden were already starting in with pub songs. I just let them go - this was their homeland.

Norfy: "Fascinating place." He slid in across from me.

Cosmic: "Oh, yeah." He nodded, slipping in next to Norfy in the last available spot. "I've never had Amblish Fish and Chips before. Kinda excited. I do like fish."

K: "Mhm. And hopefully, the archives will have something we need." I nodded.

Steela: "I loves fish." She smiled.

So, lunch was served. The fish was delicious. Cod, I was pretty sure. The 'chips' were great. And the Ploughcolt Lunch was a nice touch. The dish was related to the "Ploughman's" or "Plow-Boy's Lunch" from Earth - an entirely invented Charcuterie Board-like thing created by the UK Cheese Bureau after World War II to encourage cheese consumption, a rationed item during the war.

To be honest, I'd made substitute versions myself. This version was a hunk of cottage bread, a hunk of cheese, pickled onions, some Branston Pickle, a coupel tomato slices, and a rind of ham. It also came with a pint of non-alcoholic Cider. Mixed fruit cider, at that.

AJ specifically sipped it and took notes. My dear wife saw a marketing opportunity.

After we all ate, I noticed my four Amblers were in very high spirits.

Gaze: "Oi, K!" He nodded. "Magellan's a song bird." He gestured to Magellan, on Broken's shoulder.

K: "Oh, really?" I nodded with a grin.

Magellan: *Ahem!* "Chirp'a-chirp'a-chirp'aaa.. chirp'a-chirp'a-chiirp..!"

K: "Hush, now, don't you cry!" I sang along.

Magellan: "Chirp'a-chirp'a-chirp'aaa.. chirp'a-chirp'a-chiirp..!"

Lyra/K/Broken/Gaze/Keating: "That's an Irish lullaby!" And we all sang along.

Goddamn bird pulled off "Irish Lullaby." We sang along with him. I laughed.

Lyra: "Och, Magellan! Yer certified a good bird, ye is!" She beamed.

Magellan: "TWEET!" He puffed up.

I did notice, though, that Golden had slipped away and was seated with Fluttershy in the corner.

K: "Good bird, Magellan." I nodded. "White, we all full up?"

Sgt. Keating: "Aye, K." He nodded firmly. "S'pose we're ready to go, then?"

K: "Yep." I stood, and handed over a bag of bits that included a hefty tip for Dumfries. "COME ON, everyone! Time to get an education!"

Broken: "Oh, I can't wait to introduce you to Professor Climbspotter, K." He nodded to me.

K: "Oh, really?" I nodded to him. "Who's that?"

Broken: "My old boss, K." He smiled. "One of the smartest Ponies I've ever known. He even called me his little sparrow!" And beamed a grin.

K: "I look forwards to meeting the Master that taught you." I patted his shoulder. "If you're any indication of what Princess College can turn out, in terms of wisdom."

Broken: "Mmm. I mostly did instruction and work at the Princess College Course of Philosophy's office in Dublin." He shrugged. "This is my first visit to the home office."

K: "I'm sure it'll be a memorable one." I smiled.

Lunch with friends in a pub in Londinium. That's what it's all about.


TIME: 14:16 GMT
LOCATION: Princess College, Londinium, Ambleon

We were met in the main entrance hall by the dean of the school, Sir Biffram Buffington. He was.. VERY posh. Very.. stuffy.

Sir Buffington: "This is absolutely an outrage!"

And very resistant to our entrance. A unicorn pony of absolute upper class breeding (read: a dick), he stood right in our way, flanked by a pair of professors - also unicorns.

K: "Ah, you must be Sir Buffington." I nodded, calmly, to him. "I'm afraid you have us at a bit of a disadvantage, sir." I gestured to the two professors with him. "No proper introductions?" I said, blinking, giving him an almost shocked face that he would forget his PRECIOUS manners.

Sir Buffington: "ECK!" He almost hissed at me. "The Royal Archives are locked away for a reason!" He looked me up and down. "They are only to be read by Mages with the HIGHEST.. security classification. Not by.." He gestured to me.. paused.. and went fumbling for the right words.

K: "Go ahead and say it." I threw up my hands.

Lady Pomeroy: "AN ALIEN!" She hissed from behind him.

Sgt. Keating: "That's Lady Polish Pomeroy." He leaned in and whispered into my ear.

K: "Gotcha." I nodded. "Never the less, we are here on Royal orders. Or would you.. defy your Liege.. with two Royal Army officers and a Sergeant here?" I gestured to Broken, Golden, and White.

Twilight: "..and this IS a diplomatic insult to the Government of Equestria as well." She stepped forwards. "PRIME MINISTER Twilight Sparkle." She insultingly introduced herself.

Raven: "..Secretary of State Raven Inkswell." She stepped up beside her. "A pleasure.. I.. -suppose.-" She got catty - I didn't think SHE could get CATTY.

K: "General-Field Marshal Sir K---- K---. Supreme Allied Commander of NEIGHTO. Commander in Chief of the Equestrain Armed Forces. Colonel of the Neigtherlands Marines. Knight of the Crystal Realm." I announced my full title, and crossed my arms.

Applejack: "An' Lady Applejack - his wife'n also Knight'a th' Crystal Realm." She narrowed her eyes.

Lady Pomeroy: "Uncouth bumpkin!" She snorted.

Rarity: "..oh, you just did not." She had to be held back by Lyra. "I AM THE ONLY ONE THAT MAY CALL HER THAT! YOU OVERSTUFFED PEACOCK!" And hissed, cattily.

Sir Buffington: "How dare you, young lady!" He puffed himself up.

Dusk: "Don't." He stepped in front of Rarity. "Just.. BUCKING don't." And GROWLED at him.

K: "Sergeant Keating?" I held my arms out for everyone to settle down.

Sgt. Keating: "Aye, suh?" He instantly snapped to attention.

K: "Go get the Horse Guards." I nodded. "If needed, we will force our way in. And you can arrest these.. ruffians masquerading as high society ponies.. for Treason against the Crown for refusing the Princess's orders, if you like."

Sgt. Keating: "Aye, suh!" He nodded sharply, turned smartly, and marched double time, until he got to the doors, then GALLOPED back to the palace at a soldier's speed.

K: "I give him about five minutes to get some lads here." I narrowed my eyes at the three. "You may give us access, or be clapped in irons." I shrugged, arms still wide. "Your choice."

Katrina: *Tskt* She vocalized from the back of the crowd, then stepped forwards. "Being clapped in irons is the least of your worries.." She purr-growled.

Sir Buffington: "TH-THE WITCHWEED WITCH!" He staggered back, terrifed, all of a sudden. "H-HOW DO- YOU SHOULD BE DEAD!!"

Katrina struck a pose, let her right paw-hand claws pop out, produced an emory board, and gently filed one of them.

Katrina: "I got better." She retracted them, and looked at the trio. "The human, K, saved me." And cocked a brow. "I now answer to him." And leaned forwards a bit. "Now, step aside or I'll simply suck out your free will.. and make you my slaves.. I'm sure the coal mines around here could use a few new workers." She growl-purred again.

The third Unicorn there, instantly urinated on the floor, collapsed, and scooted back away from us.

Professor Gumboodle: "N-NO! A-ANYTHING..! ANYTHING BUT THAT!" He was unable to make his muscles work properly, and simply curled up, tail tucked. "BUFFRAM, THEY SAID NOTHING ABOUT HER! NOTHING! I-I-I DON'T WANT MY SOUL SUCKED OUT! BLOODY TARTARUS, COLT! BLOODY BUCKING TARTARUS!" He looked right at Katrina. "PLEASE! PLEASE, GREAT WITCH! LEAVE ME BE AND-AND-"

Buffington's horn glowed. Everyone knew what he was about to do. We were so close, though, that he didn't have time. Golden spear-tackled Lady Pomeroy, and Dusk cold-cocked Sir Buffington with a precise right uppercut, that sent him flying and sprawling.

Right about then, Sergeant Keating arrived with five soldiers from Horse Guards, three Constables, and his officer - Lieutenant Flyen Dover.

Lt. Dover: "General K!" He stood at attention. "What gives, sire?"

K: "These three are traitors, working for Tirek." I cocked a brow. "They're yours to dispose of." I pointed to the last one. "Except him. He's now Katrina's property."

Katrina: "..oh, yes! Y'hes he is!" She cocked a brow, slinked over, and leaned WAAY over him, letting her breasts swing free under her button-up shirt. "Isn't that right?"

Professor Gumboodle: "..YE-YES! I-I am.. I am the Thrall of the Witchweed Witch!" He was completely in the fetal position.

Katrina: "Mm.. A better fate than a Traitor's Death, no?" She purred at him.

Professor Gumboodle: "I-Indeed!" He whimpered.

Lt. Dover: "Ah, yes. Well." He nodded to the Constables. "Arrest these traitors! And take them to The Tower!" He pointed. "General K! Is there anything else we may assist with, sire?"

K: "Just K." I shrugged. "Not sire. If you must, just sir." I nodded. "We need to know where the Archives are."

Lt. Dover: "I think the professor knows." He nodded to Professor Gumboodle.

Katrina: "Oh, REALLY!?" She mockingly flashed her claws.

K: "I want to know what he knows. Kat? He's all yours." I nodded.

Katrina: "Of course!" She smirked, and sank her right-claws into his flank - making him yelp - and dragged him away. "Be right ba~ack!" She hummed, sing-songy.

Lt. Dover: "..she'll not kill him, will she?" He cocked a brow.

K: "Nope. But he'll probably be a blubbering mess fit for an asylum after this." I nodded.

Lt. Dover: "Fair play." He nodded.

About ten minutes later, Katrina exited the side room. We could hear the professor crying. A full platoon from Horse Guards had also shown up, along with another squad of Constables.

Katrina: "..that Unicorn Supremacist cult?" She nodded and gestured around the room. "It's here, too." And shrugged. "Most of the Unicorns on staff are in on it - and the ones that aren't, are looking the other way." She frowned, her whiskers twitching a bit. "They fired all the ones that wouldn't go along with things.. ohh.. right around the time of the Tornado." And sighed.

K: "Lieutenant. We need more horsepower." I turned to him. "This is an internal law enforcement matter, so I don't have much say in it, but these people are traitors. I strongly suggest you round up and arrest every Unicorn instructor on campus, and hold all the Unicorn students for questioning, just in case. It was very commonly done in my world - at a place called Berkley most famously - that professors at universities would radicalize their students through their lesson plans and outright treasonous discussions in the classrooms." I gestured to him. "If you don't nip this in the bud right now, I guarantee, within a generation or few, you're not going to have a country left. I saw this almost exact same thing happen in my world's parallel to Ambleion."

Lt. Dover: "..I think I should get Brigadier Stone." He lowered his head. "And summon Reeve Burlap." Then looked back to me.

K: "By all means." I pointed to the rest of CAG. "Everyone take up positions - no one leaves the campus until superior authority arrives."

Dusk: "No problem." He nodded, and gestured for everyone to follow him.

Moon Dancer: "This is CRAZY! That Unicorn Cult.. AGAIN!?" And groaned. "Why is it we seem to always end up with problems? Why isn't anything ever easy?"

Chemical Lens: "Because, Moon Dancer, we are the ones that seek problems." She gave a slight smirk.

Seems we'd found another issue that needed solving before we got to what we wanted.

Oh, well - this was Ambleion. They were more respectful and restrained, here. This shouldn't be much more than a sweep-and-clear job.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Active Campus

TIME: 14:47 GMT
DATE: War Day 983/14 Lunaris 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Princess College, Londinium, Ambleon


We were all waiting outside, and despite the culture of Ambleion, we were all in proper guarding positions. The City Constables were milling about, some talking to each other. The Horse Guards were under Sergeant Keating's command for the moment, as Lt. Dover had exited to summon superior authorities, and likely brief the Princess, too-

Dusk: "GRENADE, GET DOWN!" He spear-tackled me into the dirt.

I felt the concussive force of the grenade go off just behind me. I saw a Constable tossed to the ground, dead, blood pouring from head wounds.

K: "FUCKING GET TO COVER! COVER! LETHAL FORCE AUTHORIZED - THIS IS A BATTLEFIELD, NOW!" I nodded to Keating. "YOU WITH ME!?"

Sgt. Keating: "BY YOUR ORDERS, SIR! HORSE GUARDS, TO COVER! RETURN FIRE! RETURN FIRE!"

Rifle fire started coming down from the upper windows. We scrambled to whatever cover we could get. The poor Constables, though, were totally unarmed. The remaining ones were largely taking shelter behind a statue base.

K: "CONSTABLE CORPORAL! WITHDRAW YOUR PONIES!" I looked to Trixie. "COVERING FIRE!"

Trixie: "..ABOUT BUCKING TIME!" She levitated her Abrams off her back, and slapped it down about 12 meters to my left. Twilight was also close by, and slapped HER Abrams down next to her. "I bet The Great and Suppressive Fire Trixie gets more than you, Spunkle!" She grinned, mischeviously.

Twilight: "YEAH! YEAH! Just remember WHICH direction you're SHOOTING now!" She hissed a bit, but there was a smile, there.

Spike slipped between them with the spare belts and spare barrels.

I got to a knee, and raised my Grant Carbine. We were at fairly close distance, so, it wasn't much of a problem to start firing at the windows.

Steela ran up to a stone fence and slapped down the tripod for the EM-4 Browning. Then the gun itself.

Oh, yes, by the way, is it any shock that the big Viking Berzerker mare, wants to lug around a full Heavy Machine Gun?

Moon Dancer: "I-I've got you, Steela!" She moved up, with a spare ammo box, to function as Assistant Gunner.

Steela: "Keep up, soft nerdy pony!" She grinned.

The Browning started barking. LOUD. The stone facade of the school main building was no match.

Right about then, five Saracen Armored Cars from the Horse Guards pulled up - one was towing a 2pdr gun. It was painted very nicely, so I presumed it was one of their parade pieces. They unlimbered it quickly, as a stallion in a very nice red uniform jumped from one of the Saracens and ran over to me, throwing himself to the ground, and crawling, L2 Pistol out and in-hoof as he approached.

Bgdr. Stone: "Brigadier Timeless Stone, Horse Guards! General! What goes on here?!" He said, not missing a chance to fire off a few well-aimed shots at a pony leaning out the main building's second floor window with a Lanchester.

K: "Call it Enemy Action! These are Cultists answering to Tirek!" I said, leaning back and reloading my Grant.

Bgdr. Stone: "I thought as much!" He looked back to the Artillery crew. "BLOW THOSE BUCKING BLOODY BLIGHTERS STRAIGHT TO TARTARUS!!" He yelled at full volume.

The crew did as ordered, quickly loading the weapon and maximizing its elevation. A quick shot, and the second floor area became a balcony, as the 2pdr projectile exploded, sending chunks everywhere. Several ponies fell from the hole, dead.

Dusty: "NICE!" She rolled over, loaded her Gavin, and put a shell right into the hole. "Top that!"

Trixie: "EASILY!" She and Twilight had kept the fire away from the Constables, who had fully retreated up the road, and were now making sure the area was as clear as possible. She levitated the Abrams, moved positions, and got behind a large stone planter. Directing the weapon to the fire coming from the first floor, she put eight rounds into five different windows, then pulled back down and reloaded. "I GOT SIX!"

Twilight: "LONG WAY TO GO, LOONEYBUTT!" She yelled out, as she levitated her Abrams and just used her magic like a traverse mechanism, hosing down the same windows, with greater precision, to cover Trixie's reload.

Flash: "Are they.. were they like this before?!" He asked Spike.

Spike: "Ahh.. KINDA!? Just not with this much firepower!" He handed off a belt to Flash, and dove to Trixie's position, with his girlfriend, Smolder, covering him. "HERE!" And handed her a spare belt.

K: "THIS is why I MAKE SURE we go EVERYWHERE with FULL BATTLE GEAR!" I said, dropping another magazine and reloading.

Applejack: "SMART THINKIN' HUN!" She rolled over, and ejected her Chaffee magazine, reloading as well, this time with Slugs.

Rarity: "KEEPING IN MIND THAT I AM PREGNANT!" She shouted from way behind us - she was using a Saracen's turret as cover, and picking them off with her Sherman-Spencer.

Dusk: "I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN!" He shouted back, heaving a grenade into a first floor window.

Return fire was dying down. Time to press the advantage.

K: "GIRLS - TRIXIE FOR RARITY. NORFY, COZ, GAZE, BROKEN, GOLDEN, DUSK. ON ME!" I got up, and started advancing. "BRIGADIER, HOLD THIS POSITION, SEND ME TWO SQUADS!"

Bgdr. Stone: "ROIGHT! FOURTH SQUAD, SIXTH SQUAD, ON TH' GENERAL!" He shouted at the troops holding the area around and behind him.

We advanced towards the main doors at a Tactical Walk pace. AJ dashed ahead and bucked the doors off their hinges. Once in, first in, I whipped to my left, and opened fire on the two ponies there. AJ took care of my right. Dusk was right behind me.

K: "Trixie, Twilight, Rose, Norfy, Coz, Gaze. Left side. Sweep and clear. Take fourth squad." I nodded.

Gaze: "Aye, K!" He motioned to the Horse Guards. "C'mon, lads!"

K: "Dusk, Broken, Golden, AJ, on me. Dash, Flutters, rest of you - take sixth and go right." I nodded.

Dusty: "You be CAREFUL." She hissed. "Come on, this way!"

We advanced, heading for the stairs, to get the ones on the 2nd floor. Mounting each step carefully, I swept around, and had to put another one down, near the top of the steps, wielding a locally-made Zhukov.

K: "Last mag!" I called out, reloading. "Switching." I transitioned to my Type-34 - better in close quarters, anyway.

We got to the second floor, and there were some wounded sprawled around. They even had medics, dedicated medics, working on them.

K: "GIVE UP!" I ordered. "YOU'RE THROUGH!" I announced.

Professor Climbspotter: "..I suppose we are.." He coughed, from the corner. "Lay them down, lads. We've lost."

What few Unicorns were left, armed, did as instructed.

Broken: "P-Professor Climbspotter?!" He lost his composure. "YOU!?"

Professor Climbspotter: "..oh. YOU." He rolled his eyes.

K: "Know him?" I asked Broken, while pointing to the weapons. "Dusk, secure those, and secure the prisoners. Don't stop the Medics from working. Treat them like POW's." I nodded.

Dusk: "..not that they deserve it, but, yes." He snorted, but complied.

Broken: "Pr-Professor!" He walked over to him. "W.." And blinked.

Climbspotter: "For the record, Dawn.. I would have kept you in a little bird cage to chirp at me with your adorably flawed philosophical logic, every morning." He narrowed his eyes at him. "Do you even understand why I called you Little Sparrow?!"

Broken: "N-No..!?" His eyes were starting to tear up.

Climbspotter: "BECAUSE YOU CHIRPED INCESSANTLY LIKE AN ANNOYING LITTLE USELESS BIRD!" He shouted, then coughed hard - he had multiple gun shot wounds.

Broken: "PROFESSOR!?" He was wounded.. about to cry, fully on.

I moved over and hugged Broken from behind.

K: "Don't you listen to this. Don't listen to him. His words carry hate. Don't let it affect you. Don't let it hurt you. That's what he wants." I pulled Broken around to look me in the eyes. "You're a damn sight smarter, better, and more awesome than he is. Why? Because deep down inside you, there is not hate. A resolve to protect, but NOT HATE." I looked at Climbspotter. "Hate is the first cancer of the soul. Hate shades everything it touches. Hate bends logic and reason, corrupts it. And worse. It makes us all, lesser."

Broken.. hugged me. I just pat his mane.

Climbspotter: "W-Weak little.. sparrow.." *COUGH* "..not fit to.. speak on our condition."

Broken: "..no." He gently pushed off of me. "I am fit. More fit than one who's sold his soul to Tirek, and let his heart turn black with hate." He stood proud. "I will not let your words hurt me. And I will show the superiority of my resolve. I will survive this war, and I will theorize and philosophize about its beginnings, middles, and endings. I will absolutely thread out every individual strand of reason - and I will explore it, and lay it bare. So that nopony in the future.. ever.. is left unaware of how this happened. And moreover.. how to stop it with their hearts, and minds." He crossed his forelegs. "I will not only replace you, Professor, I will take the Course of Philosophy to new heights." He nodded back to me. "Because I have friends that BELIEVE.. that I can do it."

K: "Damn straight he does." I nodded.

And so, this chapter in Londinium ends with a minor uprising, and Broken Dawn being forced to confront hatred in its purest form. But, he refused to let it pull him down. He REFUSED to get on its level.

And if Broken is a representation of every pony in my many Armies, so long as I won this war, I knew Equus would know peace.

After all.. Friendship is Magic.
