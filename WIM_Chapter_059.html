Part 1: Naval Battle of the Sea of Neighpon

TIME: 11:22 Neighponese Royal Western Time
DATE: War Day 563/22 Decemus, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Bridge of HMS Moonlight, 57nmi from Neigha, Sea of Neighpon

Petty Officer Oarbis: "Captain! Commodore! Warships spotted ahead! Scout Pegasi reports a fleet of twenty-three enemy ships - forward screen of medium-sized cruisers and small destroyers, with twelve battleships!" He came in from the wing observation post.

K: "Range?"

Oarbis: "One-one-two-double-oh. They're in range of our guns, sir."

K: "Signal Inflexible, Normandie, and Thuringia. Form battle lines. Prepare for engagement. Order all troop ships to about-face and steam out of here, heading due south-west." I nodded.

Sargasso: "Signal our cruisers to get out ahead of us, and Frigates to prepare for torpedo attack." She nodded cooly.

Capt. Sea Swirl: "All hands to battle stations! Main guns, prepare for ranging fire!"

Petty Officer Saltfeather: "General, foreign fleets report ready status. On your go, sir."

K: "Have the Germane and Prench destroyers provide artillery cover for the Ambleonian and Prench frigates and torpedo boats. We'll cover our own and the Germane ones with our Frigates. All Torpedo Boats and Corvettes, prepare for massed torpedo attack." I nodded to Sea Swirl. "Start ranging fire - and order Inflexible to do the same."

Saltfeather: "Inflexible is engaging in ranging fire, sir. Torpedo boats are out ahead, and prepared to strike."

I watched from the bridge, as the smaller craft of our fleet moved out ahead, and prepared to engage. We were out of range of torpedoes, but it wouldn't be long.

K: "Saltfeather, have the torpedo craft begin their attack run. Thirty-two knot run, until they're in range, then drop one spread each in one large unaimed wave at three-quarters maximum range, and break off. Have them circle back to the cruisers and get behind them."

Saltfeather: "Aye, General!"

I watched as incoming fire started to arc through the air, and impact around us. Commanding the whole fleet wasn't going to be easy, but it could be done. The smaller vessels all advanced at 32 knots, and I could see them move towards the horizon. Once they got near enough the enemy ships, I could see them start to break off, indicating their torpedoes were away.

I then watched intently for torpedo impacts.

I was rewarded with what I wanted to have happen - Tirek's vessels started to break formation to dodge the torpedoes, and in the resulting confusion, his close-distanced battle group started having to perform very tight maneuvers to avoid collisions.

One battleship collided with its escorting Cruiser, and almost cleaved it in half. At the same moment, three torpedoes struck the cruiser, and caused massive explosions.

Saltfeather: "Alacrity reports five enemy cruisers damaged, three destroyers hit with one sinking, and one battleship hit, as well as one collision between a battleship and a cruiser."

Sargasso Sea: "Captain, have Moonlight contribute fire to that collided battleship - order Docksylvania and Greenbroke to join us. I want that battleship downed."

I nodded at her orders.

K: "Signal the Ambleonian Cruisers to focus fire on the enemy cruisers. Prench cruisers take the enemy destroyers - all on all. Battleships come about and present broadside. Inflexible and Invincible focus fire on the lead battleship. Celestia and Shining Armor focus on the enemy battleship dead ahead. Normandie and Thuringia focus fire on the enemy battleship on the far right wing. Germane crusiers screen against enemy destroyers. Fleet come to speed of 20 knots for maneuvers."

Satlfeather: "Aye, General."

I felt us turn and engage the enemy battleship that was crippled. The one hit by torpedoes was flagging behind the formation, and seemed to be fighting a fire and flooding. I observed the battleships behind us come about, and start coordinating fire. Thurngria's turn was clumsy, due to her lower speed, but she took a position ahead of Normandie, just as several Cruiser shells found their mark on her, but virtually bounced off.

I turned to see the enemy cruisers immediately get pinned down by the Ambleonian ones. They had six initially, and now, it was four-on-four. The enemy destroyers were taking heavy fire from the six-inch guns of the Prench cruisers, and having to dodge instead of line up for a torpedo attack.

Now..!

K: "Torpedo ships, cut in now! Second wave! Drop two spreads of Torpedoes at the Battleships, then fall back!" I ordered.

Saltfeather: "Aye!"

The torpedo ships slipped from behind cover, and charged out at full speed. Each national fleet staying with its own, the Prench getting there first, and dropping spreads towards two enemy battleships that were attempting a broadside turn, having found range on Thuringia and Normandie. The ships tried to turn back, to go bow-on to the torpedoes, but they simply weren't fast enough. Gouts of spray erupted from the sides of both, with the lead battleship immediately listing.

K: "Scout status report." I called.

Oarbis: "Three enemy battleships undamaged - they're already falling back and attempting to retire. All other enemy ships are damaged or engaging."

K: "Ask Invincible and Inflexible if they have the range to put some shots on the-"

Satlfeather: "General! Communication from an allied fleet!"

K: "Here!" I grabbed the headset. "This is NEIGHTO Supreme Allied Commander, General K. Allied vessel, repeat your transmission."

VAmg. Tortellini: "This'a is Vice Ammiraglio Giovanni Tortellini of the Roaman Empire Navy. We have'a cut off the enemy's escape.. allied ships coming in from'a de nort'west. Watch'e your shootings, eh?"

K: "Admiral. Thank you. Don't let them get away!"

VAmg. Tortellini: "Sç, Generale!" I could hear him laugh.

I looked up to see Invincible and Inflexible turn their thirteen-inch guns on an enemy battleship close astern, and all fire at once. The huge shells impacted all over the hull, causing large holes, and knocking one gun turret completely off its barbette.

Saltfeather: "Sir, the enemy fleet is in disarray. They're attempting to rally around the battleship in the rear of the formation, General."

K: "Order Normandie and Thuringia to target that battleship. Aim for the superstructure. Prench torpedocraft, launch an attack on them. I want that ship sunk." I pointed. "As for the rest, chase them north-west."

Saltfeather: "Aye."

Normandie's 12-inch guns were levelled with murderous intent on the enemy vessel, as Thuringia came up to her rear, aligining its 9.4-inch guns with Normandie's rear 9.4-inchers. All turrets fired at almost the same moment, the massive broadside arcing over and scoring 50% hits, one going right through the conning tower of the enemy battelship and exploding within. The Prench small craft completed their high-speed turn at that moment, and the fish in the water had an easy target. No attempt to dodge, and the enemy flagship took eight fish to the gut. She started to list to port, and an explosion erupted in her aft turret, cracking the ship in half.

The rest of the enemy fleet was attempting to retire.. and on my orders, we kept our distance and resumed formation. One destroyer, three battleships, and one cruiser.. cut off by the Roaman Navy. I saw the Roaman ships ahead as we grew closer, and while I immediately disapproved of the two battleships' designs, I watched them loose sixteen ten-inch shells EACH, and pepper the enemy battleships with hits and bracketing. The Roaman torpedo craft charged in at high speed, and made a perfect torpedo run, executing a high speed turn, and sending fish almost straight from west to east, full spreads. The enemy vessels couldn't escape the cloud of torpedoes, every enemy ship was hit..

..and the ones that weren't immediately sinking, were set upon by the Protected Cruisers, with heavy gunfire.

However it happened, we'd bested Tirek's fleet.. and I was sure, we'd just secured the Sea of Neighpon from enemy occupation. The invasion should go smoothly, now.

Part 2: SPQR

TIME: 13:14 NRWT
DATE: War Day 563/22 Decemus, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Ward Room of RNS Ceasar, 48nmi from Neigha, Sea of Neighpon

The RNS Ceasar, lead ship of the Imperio-class Battleships, was an impressive vessel with a nagging flaw - two of its main gun turrets were directly amidships and only able to fire on a broadside. This didn't change the fact that these were quadruple-gun turrets of 10-inch caliber. Just one turret finding its mark would be fatal to anything but a well armored Armored Cruiser.

Vice Admiral Tortellini was another story. Slightly overweight, this large - if pudgy - Earth stallion similar to Mac's frame, had a khaki colored coat, and a grey-and-black mane indicating some age. He was, however, fiercely efficient and attentive to detail. Interestingly, he had a sharp, small, wedge moustache, and a thicker soul patch.

We were being seated in his Ward Room, with a large buffet platter consisting of Tiramisu, Biscotti, Roaman Coffee, and other delectables. Of which the Admiral was heartily, if measuredly, partaking.

VAdm. Tortellini: "General K---- K---!" He bowed his head sharply. "Vice Ammiraglio Giovanni Tortellini." He motioned with his right foreleg across his chest, and very agilely, smoothly moving to take Rarity's hoof. "You cann'a only be Miss Rarity.." He waggled his well-kempt eyebrows with a bit more than a casual flirt. "..an honor." He kissed her hoof. "My Lady." Rising, he indicated the chairs. "Please, please."

Rarity, for her part, gave him her most Society Smile, and graciously accepted the hoof-kiss. Noting of course that, in Pony culture, a hoof-kiss is more complimentary and servile than a hand kiss is among humans, since they walk on hooves and they might be dirty.

Rarity: "Admiral Tortellini." She nodded, and indicated the others. "This is Commandant Forest Spirit, Commodore Sargasso Sea, my dearest friends, Applejack K---, Twilight Sparkle, Toola Roola, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, and Rainbow Dash, along with a couple of our other close friends and advisors, Majors Tankette Blinda, Lidless Gaze, Cosmic Plane, and Norfy Loconsole."

K: "My General Staff, Admiral. Part of it, anyway." I shrugged, and took a seat between Rarity and the lusting lothario of an Admiral. "Your fleet performed well in the engagement - my compliments."

VAdm. Tortellini: "Please, please, my friends call me Gio." He tapped his right hoof to his chest. "I have been in service to the People and the Senate of Roam for many years. Among the many nations, Roam has always been proud of its navy, eh? Though, I must admit, until you came along with far better technology, it was a navy with little'a teeths, si?"

K: "That explains the formation coordination." I nodded. "You've all had practice."

VAdm. Tortellini: "Si, Generale."

K: "If I'm calling you Gio, you call me K, alright?" I smirked.

Gio: "Si, si, K." He chuckled a bit. "As you wish. Oh! Please, have some Cappuchino. We have heard the famous General K likes coffee.." He gestured. "..I wish my guests to be welcome and comfortable."

I did indeed let his attendant make me a fresh cup. The noise I expected from the puller was.. not present. I then realized that the majority of the machine was behind a bulkhead. Smart! It also tasted fantastic.

K: "So, why have you come?" I tilted my head. "I didn't even think to ask for Roam's assistance in liberating Neighpon."

Gio: "The Senatus.. and the Populus.. we see Equestria fight so hard. Our troops? Even our vaunted Legions? Ehh.. they have so little'a experience in fighting. This was'a de first time we have fired shots in true anger in so many years." He shook his head. "Training only goes so far, K." He gestured as he snatched another stick of Biscotti. "We'a know.. when'a de times come. We will have'a to shed Roaman blood alongside our brothers and'a sisters from all over NEIGHTO. De Senate.. wishes our best troops to be bloodied before that'a happens. We hope'a to avoid another Gallopoli."

K: "Ahh.." I shrugged. "..I'm not familiar-"

Forest Spirit: "Gallopoli was a battle between the Roaman Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Roaman troops, having no combat experience, broke and fled in cowardice. This was about a hundred years ago." He shrugged. "Many Roaman troops were taken prisoner, though later released after performing ten years of harsh labor for their captors." He looked over at me. "Reparation Labor was a common punishment for losers, back in the day. Usually five or ten years - ten reserved for the most humiliating defeats."

K: "I see." I shrugged. "That explains a lot."

Gio: "A wound we still carry, a shame we still bear. So, K. What can'a we do, eh?" He gestured, taking a sip of his own Cappuchino. "How can'a de Roaman ponies help?"

K: "I've been told your ships are the fastest." I nodded. "Admiral Lauzun of the Prench Navy admitted as much. Your ships seem somewhat light on armament, so I can guess where the sacrifice was made."

Gio: "Si, si." He nodded. "We'a design for speed. Light arms to allow faster manual reloads. We chase'a de enemy, we pepper the enemy." He gestured broadly with his hooves.

It struck me just how Italian he was - talking with his hooves as he was. His accent, even when using Latin words, was unmistakably Northern Italian. I recognized it because of a former teacher of mine.

Kinda cool, actually.

K: "Okay, and your ground forces?" I asked the strategic questions.

Gio: "We have'a De People's Army and'a Militia. Unlike Equestria, the Army has only Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery. Above that we have'a de elite Legions of Roam. The Legions are our Rangers, our Marines, and our Paratroop'ahs."

K: "Interesting take - one large special operations force instead of making special operations organic to smaller formations." I shrugged. "I know a few human nations that kinda do the same thing. I presume your Legions are very distinct?"

Gio: "Si. All'a our Legions use rank and position.. ehh.. Billet, as you would say.. in Old Roaman. Whereas, the People's Army and Navy are in New Roaman."

Interesting split - Latin, to them, was simply Old Roam. I could scarcely imagine the knowledge they might have of The Ancient Ways.

K: "Senatus PopulusQue Roamanus, yes?" I smirked - I knew a tiny bit of Latin, and used a modified Cornish accent.

Gio: "Amazing! Ahaha.. we heard you'a'speak'a'da languages." He chuckled to himself, grabbing a plated slice of Tiramisu. "I am happy to see it is no lie."

K: "Dico solo veritÖ, Gio." Another smirk, perfect Venetian accent, imitating my teacher.

Rarity: "Mm.. he speaks a small amount of Prench and some Germane as well, Gio." She leaned in a bit.

K: "Eh. I grew up in a city where all of these languages were spoken, and my family was German." And Irish. I shrugged. "You pick up things."

Gio: "It'a'give me confidence." He nodded, seriously. "A man who invest his mind into learning other culture, other language, is a man of discipline and intelligence. I see, now, why Equestria comes out on top." He brushed off his uniform jacket. "I be'a perfectly honest, K. I want'a de same for our ponies."

K: "I'll integrate the Roaman fleet into our formation - we haven't long before we reach Neighpon, but your ships can screen ahead, and I can retask the Germane fleet to guard the transports closely. How many Legion Milites have you brought?" I finished the cup of Cappuchino, and I could tell it was packing some serious caffiene.

Gio: "One Camp from three different Cohorts." He nodded. "Castrum Pedites Marum, Castrum Pedites Silvis, and Castrum Pedites Montium." Gesturing, he reached for another Biscotti.

K: "Marines, Rangers, and Mountain Troops." I shrugged. "English being based on some Latin, the words make sense if you think about it. Marum means of the sea, Montium means mountains, and by process of elimination, I can guess that Silvis means woods.. or.." I gestured myself.

Gio: "Mm! Yes, yes.." He nodded.

K: "So, you can get three different types of elite troops some combat experience, and spread them back around the rest of their Cohorts when they get home." I nodded, gesturing, and continuing the thought line.

Gio: "Si! Ahaha.. K, I think'a we get along quite well. Say.. you tell me, when'a de last time you have'a good Spaghet?"

The thought made my mouth water reflexively. It had been a VERY long time...

K: "Ah.. you can't possibly mean real spaghetti with real meat balls?" I tilted my head.

Gio: "Si! Haha.. my momma will make us a fine feast this'a evening before we reach Neighpon." He grinned broadly. "Miss Rarity, I hope, will attend, si?"

Rarity: "I'd be delighted, Gio, darling." She gave him a slightly flirtatious society smile.

K: "I'll bring my wife and my officers, if you don't mind?" I patted Applejack's hoof.

Gio: "Of course! All are welcome. A family feast is an event!"

So, with that, we had a new, strong ally in our fight for Neighpon. Given the performance in the sea battle for the oceans around the main islands, I felt assured of our victory.

We'd just gotten back aboard the flagship, when Applejack decided to have a little fun at Rarity's expense. Such was typical of them - this is simply how they bonded.

Applejack: "Rarity!" She started in. "Really!" Playfully hissing.

Rarity: "What ever are you talking about, dearie?" She smirked.

Applejack: "Yew were practically crawlin' over tha' table at that Roaman Admiral!" She was getting sassy.

Rarity: "Oh? Was I?" She was acting innocent.

Toola: *Giggle* "For a sec, there, I thought you'd be diving *under* the table." She nudged her.

Rarity: "Hush, child. Not in public, I wouldn't." She smirked at me.

Twilight: "Ah.. hah.. ehh.." She was blushing. "He certainly is handsome."

K: "Mhm. And married. You all DID see the ring, right?" I put in.

Rarity: "Indeed, but I didn't see his wife, there." She trilled.

Applejack: "Rarity!" She playfully snapped as we paced along the main deck, avoiding some of the debris from a light shell hit, that was being cleaned up and repaired. "You-"

Sweetie Belle: "WHOREEE!" She popped up from a barrel.

Along with Applebloom, Scootaloo, Florale, and Starlight.

Spike stuck his head out from a crate.

K: "..." I made a noise I can't say was a word, and looked at my wife.

We were all silent, staring lasers at the kids.. even the deck crew had stopped.

Fluttershy: "..goodness!" She pushed ahead of us. "What are you doing here? You could be hurt!"

Starlight Mint: "Daddy let SPIKE come with him!" She hissed, then looked at me.

She was in suitably-shrunk tactical gear. Complete with Applejack's Sagebrush Shotgun and Custer revolver.

K: "I'm in trouble." I finally said.

Rarity: "AND I KNOW SOMEONE ELSE THAT IS!" She finally yelled, at Sweetie Belle.

K: "Uh.." I pointed at one of the crew cleaning up. "..go up to the comms station on the bridge and report this to Fillydelphia. There's going to be some worried people."

SeaPony String Line: "Aye-Aye, General!" Off she went.

Twilight: "SPiiiiikee..!" Mommy Voice.. her first time, too. "Take your friends-"

Starlight Mint: "Squad!" She insisted.

Twilight: "*SQUAD* and report to the Ward Room!" She stared right at him.


TIME: 14:24 NRWT
LOCATION: Ward Room, HMS Moonlight


The.. uh.. squad was separated by responsible party. I had Applebloom, Florale, and Starlight Mint. Twilight had Spike. Rarity had Sweetie Belle. Rainbow Dash took responsibility for Scootaloo.

K: "Who's idea was it?" I looked at Starlight Mint.

Florale: "..et was mine, PaPa.." She sniffled. "Oh, please don't be cross weth us!" She pleaded. "You and MaMa are ALWAYS going away! And I worry so! I.. my.." She was crying.

Applejack: "..well, shucks.." She frowned.

Sweetie Belle: "..sorry fer callin' you a whore out on the deck, sis.. we didn't know we were out in public like that. I kinda thought we were still in th' hold.." She was very remorseful, her cheeks red from crying.

Rarity: "..it's alright. Why.. why did you agree to come with?!" She demanded.

Sweetie Belle: "Same reason!" She looked up at her. "I mean, Granny Smith's s'nice an' all, but.." She looked down. "What if something happened to you? The Herdiets almost killed you! And they.. they.." She hugged herself. "..hurt you really bad.."

Big Mac came in, and handed me a written transcript of the communication with Fillydelphia.

K: "Welp. Scoots, you're grounded for a month." I shrugged. "Harv isn't happy, at ALL." I looked to Dash. "She did ask if you'd.. you know." I shrugged again.

Dash: "Oh, no problem.. I think some wires got crossed here. Takin' my cool attitude towards the rules and thinking I don't follow them? Something like that?"

Scootaloo: "Nuh-uh! And before you even ask.." She looked right at Dash. "If THEY were going on an adventure that you KNEW was dangerous.. and you couldn't stop them.. wouldn't you tag along?!"

Dash: "Ah.. heh.. yeah.." She looked Gilda. "..kinda exactly what I did.."

K: "Okay, okay, they've got us all pegged on good reasons to be stowaways." I held up my hands in surrender. "I don't think ANY of us considered what our jobs were doing to our kids. It's one thing to be simply gone.. it's quite another to come back and keep leaving." I shook my head. "Rarity.. Twilight.. I think we can all agree on a one-month sentence. Yes?"

Rarity: "Certainly."

Twilight: "Done." She nodded. "But, Spike serves it with me." She put a foreleg around him. "He had a taste of being on a mission.. I can't blame him for wanting another. Especially this one."

K: "Honey?" I looked to Applejack.

She was somewhere between mad, sad, angry, and ready to cry. So many emotions all at once. And all she did was grab up all three of our girls and hug them tightly.

Applejack: "Y'all gots th' makin's of the elements'a harmony.. shur'nuff." She sniffled. "Mah brave lil' sister, mah daughter, an' my half-daughter.."

Starlight Mint: "You mean ALSO daughter." She hugged back. "I was worried 'bout you, too, Mama Applejack."

Applejack: "D'awwww!!" She squealed with emotion and hugged harder.

Mac: "Hmpf. What's this war coming to?" He smirked.

K: "No idea." I shrugged. "Do me a favor, and keep them occupied and out of trouble." I gestured.

Mac: "You got it, Brother."

So, there's another fine mess I've gotten myself into. Rather, the mess tracked me down and tackled me. My kids. My friends' kids. All of them conspiring against us to try and protect us.

Brave little stinkers, aren't they?

Part 4: Big Dinner

TIME: 19:00 NRWT
DATE: War Day 563/22 Decemus, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: RNS Ceasar, Neigha Bay, Empire of Neighpon

I was in my winter formal uniform.. and fortunately, it had a bit of extra room in it. Rarity, of course, had designed it. Medium blue topcoat in a somewhat formal military style, with a simple set of Buff-colored strips along the cuff - two large ones. Epaulettes with my rank insignia on them, no fringe. A Buff cord under the right arm, thin and braided. Simple tassle. Four large buttons down the front, starting at the chest, but purely decorative, as behind the button flap, it was a zipper. The topcoat itself was "Ike Jacket" length, ending at my belt. Left lapel cinched with a Celestia Sun, right with a Luna Moon. Pants were off-white. Necktie was the same off-white, as was the undershirt. Really, it looked something like a Continental Army uniform, just with a different jacket style. Even the black boots that went with it were up to my knees (and, again, were zippered).

Emperor no Ken was, equally, in his formal clothes. As were the Bushin. Everyone was.

Applejack? Was in a very formal dress. A variation on one of her Gala gowns - the one she'd worn the year I showed up.

Starlight Mint, Florale, and Applebloom (who REALLY DIDN'T LIKE FORMAL CLOTHING) were all in dresses hastily assembled by Rarity, but looking magnificent. Mint was wearing the same topcoat I was, but without any rank pins or insingia, and a skirt, with boots. Florale was in a near-copy of her mother's Gala gown. Applebloom really only agreed to a "nice dress" so, hers was linen, with some.. minor.. decorative indulgences by the designer.

K: "Emperor." I bowed to him, formally. "My now-wife, Applejack K---."

Emperor no Ken: "Ahh! You HAVE wed!" He bowed in return. "I had hurd, ov cose, dat you had.. married your rlady rlove." Still having trouble with L's, he was.

K: "My daughters, Starlight Mint and Pomme Florale." I set a hand on either of them. "And my sister-in-law, Applebloom."

Emperor no Ken: "Ahhmm.." He grinned happily. "You remember my daughtah.. Princess Yuuki."

When she stepped up the gangway to the main deck, she looked like a perfect China doll.. in pony form. She had on full formal make-up.

K: "Princess Yuuki!" I grinned. "It's been nearly a year."

Indeed, she'd grown.. she looked much tougher, too. It didn't help that Bushin Senshi was escorting her. He came over to me and bowed, slightly higher than normal, indicating familiarity.

Senshi: "General K." He handed me back his Uchigatana. "I berieve you reft zis behind." He smirked at me.

Emperor no Ken: "Ah.. wheah iz Commodore Sartine?" He asked, suddenly wondering.

Sargasso Sea: "Emperor.." She bowed to him. "..I'm Commodore Sargasso Sea. Forgive me.. but.. Admiral Saletine has died in battle, ramming HMS Bellerophon into an enemy battleship." She cleared her throat a bit. "He defended Fillydelphia Harbor with his very life, when it came under attack."

The Bushin behind the Emperor, Princess Yuuki, and the Emperor himself all lowered their heads in silence.

Emperor no Ken: "Zhen we wirr avegne him az werl!" He said, emphatically, his head still lowered. After a moment, he raised it. "I shall miss his.. unique and exhuberant attitude." He nodded.

K: "Admiral Whitecap now leads the Equestrian Navy." I nodded. "You remember Captain Forest Spirit? Now Commandant of Marines. And Lieutenant Blinda, now Major." I gestured to them.

Forest Spirit: "Your Imperial Majesty." He head-bowed, but didn't fully bow.

Blinda: "Emperor. It's a pleasure to see you once again." She, however, did fully bow.

Senshi: "Mm.. seems our friends come back to us, eh?"

K: "With new friends. This is Gendarmes Sergeant Dusty Dunes, and Warrant Officer Gorcat." I nodded to them.

Dusty: "Emperor! It's an honor, sire." She also fully bowed.

Gorcat: "Uhm, sire." He bowed as well. "Sorry.. ah.. not used to formal events and things."

Emperor no Ken: "Yees.. you are couzin to Gorlamb, yes?" He wagged his hoof at Gorcat.

Gorcat: "Uh, yes, sire." He nodded a bit. "I heard he was here.."

Emperor no Ken: "He has, in fact, taken position as one of my offisah's.." He gestured as Gorlamb came up with some senior Neighponese military officers.

Gorlamb: "Cousin!" He smirked. "See you've quit, too."

Gorcat: "'Bif's dead. Died a couple months back - blown up by the Crystal Kingdom Air Fleet." He shrugged. "You'n I, 'n Uncle Gorton's all that's left, now."

Gorlamb: "Man.. what about auntie-"

Gorcat: "Killed in Marelin by that dragon." He shook his head.

Gorlamb: "Wow." He held his hand out. "Family?"

Gorcat didn't just shake hands, he pulled him into a bro-hug.

Gilda and Dash were there.. and they were whispering to each other. I caught it out of the corner of my eye.

Gorcat: "The human here's.. saved me from Tarjas.." He shrugged. "Kinda owe him my life. Got lots to catch up on, ya know?" He patted him on the back.

Adm. Tortellini: "AHA! Ahh.. come, come everyone! To'a de mess hall, yeh?" He came out of the superstructure, waving to everyone. "Ah, you must'a be de Emperor of Neighpon!" He bowed deeply. "I am Vice Ammiraglio Giovanni Tortellini, Capo delle Operazioni - Chief of Operations - of the Roaman Navy. Welcome aboard the Ceasar!"

Emperor no Ken: "An honah." He returned the bow. "A marve'ous ship. Mm.." He presented him with a bottle of Sake. "For de host. I undahstand is tradition in your part of de world."

Adm. Tortellini: "Si, Emperor." He gave a deep nod, accepting the gift. "Tonight, you shall dine like never before! Mi'a'Mama.. she has prepared a Roaman feast." He turned to Rarity, of course, and bowed to her.. taking her hoof in his, right as a Roaman Navy Lieutenant Commander of about his age came up behind him. "Ah, miss Rarity-"

LCDR Tortellini: "GIO!" She hissed, but turned to the Emperor and bowed as well. "Mi Emperor.. I am.. de Admiral's wife.. Tiente Comandante, di Contessa Franchesca Tortellini." She gave Gio the laser eyes..

Rarity: "Admiral." She was formal, in that, then nodded to Franchesca. "Contessa." She gave a welcoming smile.

Emperor no Ken: "Yes.. Contessa Torterrini.." He coughed a bit. "Shawrl we go inside?" Good Emperor.. defuse the situation.

For his part, Admiral Tortellini seemed.. a bit.. disappointed that his fun was cut off. Rarity flicked me a look of 'But, I wanted to blackmail him!' Applejack shot her a look, matched only by Sweetie Belle, who had the good sense to keep her mouth shut.

Inside the Officer's Mess, I could see where some of the "weight savings" for the lower gun caliber went. The room was nothing short of ornate, but tasteful. Linen tablecloths, lower ranked sailors being waitstaff in formal uniforms, guards in formal uniforms by the doors, the whole thing had the trappings of a state dinner.

And we were eating spaghetti.

Some might think this a very unusual mismatch, but it was homemade from start to finish. The noodles, the sauce, the meatballs, everything. THAT alone made it fancy. What made it State Dinner worthy was that it was made by the Admiral's mother..

..Regina Emeritus Stella Scintillante Veloce.

Applejack: "..holy haybales.." She muttered under her breath. "..ah'm feelin' under dressed.."

K: "You're not the only one." I cleared my throat a bit. "Admiral, you didn't tell me the Princeps Senatus was your brother."

Gio: "Eh. How you think I gott'a dis position? Eh? My good looks alone?" He batted his eyes at Franchesca. "Actually, the Princeps is her brother. Heh. No, I get my rank the old fashioned way. Mama Veloce treat me like her own." He showed us to one of the tables, and got Applejack's chair (not Rarity's).

Applejack: "Thank'ya." She was still looking like she felt out-of-place, like this was a step above her.

I nodded towards poor Dusty, who REALLY looked embarrassed, in her formal Las Pegasus Gendarmes police-style uniform. Toola Roola was seated next to her, and trying to help her be more at-ease. SHE was wearing "hippie formals" - simple pleated skirt, a flower-cascade top, rose-tinted glasses, artsy beret, thick belt with a fat buckle, and what were essentially Pony Sandals.

We were served immediately.

Mama Veloce: "Ah, General K!" She put the plate right in front of me. "Here. Have somm'a Mama's Spahgetti." She even hugged me. "I don' know how humans are suppose to look.. but you looka' too skinny! You not win'de war look'a so skinny! Here, eat, eat!"

K: "Thank you, Mama." I nodded graciuosly.

Applejack: "Thank'ya ma'am." She nodded as well.

K: "My wife, Mama." I nodded to Applejack.

Mama Veloce: "You.. you look'a strong, still, too skinny! You wanna give'a him good foals? You need more." She heaped on some more Spaghetti on my wife's plate. "An' call'a me'a Mama Veloce." She patted her head, and kissed the top of it, before moving on.

K: "All Italian mamas are like this." I shrugged. "You come to their house, you better prepare to get fed."

My wife was blushing. Hard. I had to admit, it was cute.

Rarity was on the other side of me, and was rather enjoying herself.. and the wine. Again. This wouldn't end well, but we were all together.

Throughout the dinner, I was mainly focused on the food. While I knew I'd be expected to talk, the spaghetti was just so.. so good. I wasn't entirely sure what the meatballs were made from, but they were fantastic.

Havoc messed with Bella a little bit, and re-enacted the kiss scene from "Lady and the Tramp" but intentionally. He also balanced, flipped, and caught a meatball. Bella was impressed, of course, with his prowess. Mama told him not to play with his food. He apologized.

Dessert was homemade Tiramisu. And boy, was it ever good. Of course, I drank no alcohol, opting for Cappuchino at first, then water, then plain coffee to go with the Tiramisu.


TIME: 22:47


Gio: "So! You have'a all had Mama's delicious cooking." He bowed a bit, having undone his formal jacket. "It seems the evening grows late, eh?" He raised his glass. "Emperor. To you, to your citizens, and to NEIGHTO. We have'a arrived. We help you take back your homes."

Emperor no Ken: "Hai!" He raised his glass as well.

We all did.

I was feeling very confident that we'd end this theatre of the war, soon. We just needed time.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Interplay

TIME: 23:45 NRST
DATE: War Day 563/22 Decemus, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: HMS Moonlight, Neigha Bay, Empire of Neighpon

Tomorrow we'd go ashore. Neigha secured, the Emperor could afford to put us up in suitable digs. At the moment.. I was helping Rarity, AND Applejack off the Ship's Awayboat.. both VERY drunk. Pomme Florale was.. oddly kinda okay with this. Starlight was a bit worried. Applebloom was frustrated with her sister.

Mac was - thank Celestia - helping me. He had the kids, and he was stone sober. Forest Spirit was a bit lit up, but he was getting help from Redheart (and her big belly).

Really, everyone was a bit inebriated.

K: "Deep. Sea." I nodded to them as they got aboard. "I want you two to post extra guards everywhere. Comm that to the rest of the allied fleet. All the most senior officers are drunk-ish except me, I don't want an assassination spree, or limpet mines attached to the ships taking out half the fleet."

Deep Blue: "You got it, K." She nodded.

Sea Swirl: "No problem." She nodded. "Go get some rest."

Well, I trusted them.. so, I helped Twilight drag Rarity and Applejack to the appropriate cabins..

Rarity: "Ssh.. hould really." *mm* "..see about repeating Marelin, Darrrrling.. hehehee.." She was trying to grope me.

K: "I thought we weren't going to let her get this drunk again?" I looked at Twilight.

Twilight: "She was next to you, too, and I didn't see you stopping her." She grimaced. "Oohhh.. too much good food.."

K: "In you go." I hefted Rarity into her bed, and addressed Sweetie Belle. "Don't let her leave. I'm going to have my hands full, and we don't need your sister-"

Sweetie Belle: "Being a whore?" She snickered.

Rarity: "Huusshghhhgh.." She rubbed her hoof on Sweetie Belle's muzzle. "..I'm only a.. a proper whore.." *S'nickup!*

She assumed a prideful pose.

K: "Lock her sidearm up, too." I nodded. "Twi, make sure there's a guard outside her door."

Twilight: "Yeah." She nodded.

Well, I managed to get Applejack into OUR room without much incident.. and oh, Lord, she'd been waiting.

Applejack: "Yew. Bed. Nao." She demanded.

K: "Honey, you're dru-"

Applejack: "Ah wuz drunk th' ferst time." She corrected me, before (easily) overpowering me and shoving me into the bunk.

K: "I don't have a choice. Do I?" I smart-assed back at her.

She undid my pants with her mouth, slid them down to my boots, unzipped my boots with her hooves (not easy), pulled them off, and stripped my bottom half entirely.

I? Started pulling off my jacket and formal vest. She was horny. I was enjoying this. My wife. Dear God.. I was hard. I wanted her. I was thinking back to how adorable she looked in the dress, how cute her reactions had been at dinner, and her gaze upon me as she'd gotten drunker and drunker on the wine.

I was down to my black A-Frame when she sunk her mouth down over my knob. Slow, with a hot breath, her tongue sloppily licking the tip before her mouth engulfed the length all the way down.

I moaned. It'd been far too long since I'd done this.

My hand found the back of her head.. rested there, and she went up.. down.. up.. down.. slow, careful, deliberate.. her eyes locked with mine. Her lust absolute, resolute.. this was just foreplay.

I took the chance to get fully nude, slipping off my A-Frame and flicking it towards my normal clothes.

She grinned, splayed her tongue all the way to my balls.. and gave a loud moan, going ALL the way down, deep throating my length, knowing my weakness for the sensation of her swallowing.. which she did, gupling lustful saliva.. making my hips buck and shake..

..and just as I was about to blow, she stopped, and pulled back. Licking her lips. Teasing me. Not letting me finish. Teasing the Monkey Sex God.

K: "Ooouuhh.. you little.." I lolled my head back. "..playing with fire."

Applejack: "Mhm.. what'chu'gun'do'bout'it?" She lustily teased back.

I slid down off the bunk, so we would be at eye level, slid my arms under hers, and pulled her gown off. I noted she'd already freed herself of undergarments.

Both of us naked, I gently hefted her up, and teased her snatch with my tip.. she was trying to slam down, but I wasn't letting her.

Do Not Anger The Monkey Sex God Unprepared.

I, instead, gently raised my hips so that just the tip would tease her lower lips.. slip between them but not inside her.. essentially, hot dog her a bit. She moaned, and whinnied.. and tried so hard to just get me inside her.. until I finally relented and let her go.

She slipped me inside her so easily, she was so wet.. and she rode me, face to face, sitting on the floor of our room.. just going at her own pace.. which wasn't enough for me, but she darn well knew that. I let her wear herself out, my hands sliding along her back, feeling and massaging her muscles, appreciating my wife's body for its perfection..

Our eyes rarely broke contact, only when she shut them to orgasm. Finally, when I could tell she was getting tired.. and had run through four major orgasms..

K: "You KNOW I do better on top, my love."

She whined hard.

I hefted her up, laid her on the bunk face-up.. got into position.. and DRILLED into her. She screamed in orgasmic extacy. I was sure the entire ship.. nay, the whole FLEET could hear us. I didn't care. I was fucking my wife. And it felt so damn good.
