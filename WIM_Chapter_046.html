Part 1: Dark and Terrible

TIME: 07:45 ERST
DATE: War Day 460/9 Septimus, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Ponyville, Kingdom of Equestria

I arrived back in town on the 7:45 train. Sunshine Smiles met me at the train station, with his guards and Lord Sombra. I'd taken the chance to make sure Sunrise was cleaned up and ready for this. As ready as she could be. She didn't talk, much, during the three day train trip.

Sunshine: "SIS!" He seemed happy, at least. "Thank Celestia you're alright."

Sunrise: "H-Hey, Broo..." She was totally uncomfortable.

Lord Sombra: "My friend! You have returned to us. We hath heard you've conquered yet another foe!"

He whipped out the Canterlot Tribune. 'GENERAL K AND COMMANDANT SPIRIT BUST MOB!' Secondary byline? 'LAS PEGASUS MAFIA LOSES ENTIRE TOP BRASS!' And underneath a picture of him? 'INSP. BRONCOMIL PROMISES CLEAN SWEEP!'

Seems the locals in Las Pegasus were overjoyed at the idea of being free from Mob control. Once again, despite my earlier assertions that I was superfluous, I had made ponies indebted to me.

Sunshine: "Sis.. come on, please, it's been years! I've been DEAD, you know? Come on, I.. I want to make things right between us!" He seems.. far more desperate and even submissive than I'd ever seen him.

Sunrise: "RIGHT!? YOU WANT TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT!? BRING MOM BACK! YOU DO THAT! YOU DO THAT AND THINGS WILL BE RIGHT BETWEEN US!" She viciously spat, in public.

Cadence came upon this at the worst possible time, though her intentions were pure.

Cadence: "Sunrise Smiles, right?" She curtsied a bit. "I'm Cadence.. I was supposed to wed Shining Armor, but your brother.." She blushed hard. "..won my heart, after his death."

Bad choice of words.

Sunrise: "KILLED ANOTHER ONE, DID YOU!?" She yelled.

Sunshine: "SIS! No, it's not like that! It's a WAR, Sis! He was murdered by the Queen of the Changelings!" He waved his hoof, but he was clearly on the defensive.

Cadence: "Sunrise... Sunrise, there's no need for this hostility." She raised her hooves to try and calm her down. "Sunshine.. whatever happened in the past, we want to be here for you, now. We wanted to ask you to take the office of Duchess, an-"

Sunrise: "NOW YOU'RE MARRYING A PRINCESS!? YOU.. JUST... WANT.. TO.. KEEP.. RUBBING IT IN MY FACE, DON'T YOU!?" She screamed at both of them.

Lord Sombra (to me): "My friend, what are we to do?" He seemd genuinely upset, and at the same time, totally lost.

K: "Let them fight it out. I have no idea what's going on here, but this is a long time coming, it seems." I shrugged.

Rarity: "She's acting like a.." She looked at me. "..very unladylike person!"

Dash: "She's a bitch, but she seems to have a reason." She shrugged, putting it plainly.

Cadence: "Can we.. discuss this somewhere else?" She was looking at the crowd they were drawing.

Sunrise: "Don't bucking bother. Here, I showed up - your pet human got my patron arrested. Now I have to start all over again. EVERY TIME!" She poked her hoof into his chest. "EVERY TIME! You do this to me! You RUIN EVERYTHING!"

Dash: "She better watch her mouth, talking about you like that." She looked ready to jump her.

Rarity had her lids half closed. Her 'sniper's eye' look.

K: "Can't win 'em all over." I shrugged.

Sunshine: "Sis.. please.. it's.. I've never-"

Sunrise: "You damn well have!" She snorted at him. "Every chance I ever had, you ruined somehow."

Sunshine: "THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS MAKE THE WORST CHOICES! YOUR CHOICES, SUNRISE! YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT PATH IN LIFE, LOOK WHERE IT GOT YOU!? SUCKING THE DICK OF A MAFIA DON! K DID WHAT HE HAD TO DO TO PROTECT YOU!" He finally found his pair.

Cadence: "Honey, easy, remember, we want to mend bri-"

Sunrise: "SHUT UP, PRINCESS WHORESALOT!" She sneered at her.

Cadence: "..what did you call me?" Her eyes half closed.

Sunrise: "WHORE! A FILTY, STREET-WALKING *WHORE*!!"

Cadence: "I thought so." She took off her crown and stuck it in Sunshine's hands. "Hold this please, love." *Ahem* She rolled her neck a second. *MREEEAARRRRRR!*

CADENCE TACKLED HER TO THE GROUND LIKE A CHUMP! All of a sudden, the two of them were wrestling on the ground like a pair of common street urchins. Skags, even, if you prefer the British term. Hair pulling, low shots, hooves flying, dress ripping...

And poor Sunshine looks like he just died inside. Eyes like pinpricks, mouth agape, recoiled in horror, a flat look of utter defeat and broken spirit across his visage..

Time to take charge. I leaned over and grabbed a guard's Chaffee.

*PASHOOOOM!*

K: "BOTH OF YOU STOP THIS NONSENSE RIGHT NOW!" I screamed, bellowed, with all of my human might.

Both girls FROZE in place and then cowered on the ground in full surrender position, tails tucked and everything. Mind you, I just managed to intimidate the fourth-most-powerful pony on the planet. And a former comrade-in-arms.

K: "You're both acting like total bitches. Common thugs!" I waved a hand at both of them. "LOOK at yourselves!" I looked at Sunrise. "And I'm NO PET! I'm the Supreme Commander of the Equestrian Armed Forces! AND SUNSHINE'S FRIEND!" I gestured at him. "BOTH of you need to STOP FIGHTING, and GO INSIDE!" I pointed at Twilight's library. *"NOW!"*

I got both of them into the Library, and shut the door. Spike? Wisely took cover under Twilight's bed (though, I noted, he's getting too big for that).

K: "SIT!" I demanded.

They did. Even Sunshine.

K: "Start at the beginning. Sunrise?" I looked at Cadence and Sunshine. "Both of you hush."

Sunrise: "I don't see how this is your business." She looked at me.

K: "The safety and security of the NEIGHTO alliance is my business. If one of the Royal Families is having problems, that opens the door to all kinds of potential issues." I crossed my arms. "The beginning."

Sunrise: "...it started before Mom died. Sunshine was always mommy's favorite. She doted on him, because she reminded her of Dad. I barely knew Dad. I was four when he died." She sighed. "Whenever mom and him brought Dad up, I just felt left out. Like, I should know something there, but I don't." She sniffled a little. "When mom got real sick.." She trailed off. "..I took a job at a cafe in Canterlot to support myself. She.. we didn't have a lot of money. Sunshine? Mom gave him anything. Even when she couldn't afford her meds, he got whatever." She waved her hoof. "Then, she died. I was 18. He was 21. We.. both tried to get into Luna's Guards." She pulled up her dress to reveal her Cutie Mark - it's a shield with what looks like magic stars bouncing off of it. "My special talent is the ability to reflect negative magic back at the caster.. literally, I was made to be a guard, just like Dad." She screwed up her face in anger. "BUT..." She stopped herself. "...Sunshine over there got to the enlistment officer the same day we buried Mom. Excuse ME for wanting to.. cry about her. He took the last spot!" She pointed at him. "YOU KNEW I wanted to be a guard!" She sank back in her chair. "There were other times. School, outside of school.. every time I turned around, Sunshine was right there, taking things I wanted. So, I left. Became a dancer. I'm... pretty good at it." She shrugged. "But, now, he's messed that up, too. Even with the Mob gone, there's no way in Tartarus any dance hall that pays decent is going to even LOOK at me! I'm going to be known as a curse! An invitation for the GENDARMES to come and RAID them!" She crossed her forelegs and sank to the floor. "Maybe I'd be better off dead." She was crying, now. "That way I won't get in the way of your perfect life.." She looked straight at him, with tears in her eyes.

Rarity: "Goodness..." She was stunned.

Dash didn't say anything. Sombra and the others hadn't bothered to come in.

K: "That's.. pretty bad." I shook my head. "Sounds kinda like what my human wife went through, with her sister." I shrugged. "Sunshine? Your end of it." I nodded.

Sunshine: *Sigh* "Mom loved you, too. To us, you seemed distant. Mom thought you were so torn up about Dad that you just couldn't handle it. We tried to include you in everything. I don't know where it all went totally wrong, but.. Mom told me that you'd.. go out on your own, one day, that you were stronger than me.." He looked at the floor. "..that, eventually, you somehow got over it, and moved on, and WE were the ones stuck in the past." He looked up. "All I ever wanted, was for you to be safe. I know some of the things you mean, Sis, and.. you were going to make bad choices. I wanted to stop that, prevent that.." He shook his head. "Protect you. Remember Bobby Pins? Remember I beat him up? He was boasting about how he'd make a teen mom out of you! He'd already done it to Candy Frills. Remember her? Bobby's ex?" He waved a hoof. "Then there was the dance teacher. He.." He looked at the floor. "..he was a fillyfeeler."

Sunrise: "WHAT?!" She lifted her head up.

Sunshine: "...the reason he didn't pick you for the 'special performances' was because.." He looked at the ground and curled his tail around himself in utter shame. "..I let him.. do those things to me instead." NOW he starts crying. "I DID IT TO PROTECT YOU!" He leaned on the table. "Even the Guards! Yes, YOU had the special talent for it, but I just KNEW that if I let YOU go, something would happen, and you'd DIE, just like DAD DID!" He looked at me. "AND WHAT HAPPENED!? I DIED!" He tapped his chest where one of the Kesteros had impaled him. "I died on Gloom Mountain! I was DEAD for over an HOUR!" He leaned forwards. "If that'd been you.. maybe you wouldn't have been so lucky to get resurrected." Again, looking at me. "Chowsin Ridge. If that'd been her..." He looked at the table. "I knew you had problems with me, but damnit Sunrise, I'd rather you'd hated me than be hurt or killed!" He looked up at her, tears flowing from his eyes. "THAT'S what a Big Brother does!" He pounded his hoof on the table. "No matter what." He sank back in the chair. "No matter what I have to endure. No matter what I have to go through. I'd do anything.. to protect you."

Sunrise: *SOB* "OH, CELESTIA! SUNSHINE! I DIDN'T KNOW!" She threw herself at him, and they hugged. "Celestia Praised.. Sunshine.. I.. I thought you did those things because you hated me!" She held him close.

Sunshine: "No, Sis.. I did them because I love you! I don't want anything to happen to you! You're ALL I have left!" He clung to her just as tightly.

Rarity: "It seems, my Darling, that deep seated resentment is immune to this Spell of Carefree you've theorized about." She nodded.

K: "Well.. that and her special talent deflects magic. I have a feeling that's part of it, and Sunshine has a piece of that. Must be a family thing." I stood up. "It's Mister Tapper, isn't it?" I looked at Sunshine.

Sunshine: "W-what?" He was stunned.

K: "It was Mister Toes Tapper, right?" I tilted my head.

Sunshine: "Y-Yes.. b-"

I walked out of the room. Cold as ice.

Walking past Sombra, though.. oh, I could never fool my Darkness Buddy. He picked up on my murderous intent right away, and took off after me.

K: "Toes Tapper. He's a fillyfeeler." I drew my Morgan and checked the chamber.

Sombra: "EGADS!" Literally 'by ye gods' - it used to be a serious curse word. "Isn't he-"

K: "If he has.." I grasped the Sword of Rainbow's Light in one hand, but didn't draw it. "Luna, give me strength. Luna, give me strength." I chanted this, not invoked it.

Within moments, she was at my side.

Luna: "My Love.. what.."

K: "Starlight Mint's dance teacher likes little fillies and colts." I was downright black in my emotional delivery.

Within a few minutes, we were at the door to his dance studio. I went in, totally without emotion. There were kids in there, practising a routine. He was tapping away on the piano..

K: "KIDS! Uncle Sombra's taking you for ice cream!" I looked at Starlight. "Honey, go with Uncle Sombra. Mommy and Daddy have something to discuss with Toes, m'kay, sweetie?" I put on my Daddy Face.

All the kids cheered. Starlight ran over to me and gave me a hug.

Starlight: "Okay, Daddy!" She hugged Luna, then looked back at Toes. "See you later!"

With the kids gone, Toes came over towards us.

Toes Tapper: "What can I do for you, General? Princ-"

I pounded his snout as hard as I could, knocking him down with one blow. I kicked him in the ribs, and Luna joined me. Several times.

K: "DID YOU TOUCH MY DAUGHTER, YOU PIECE OF SHIT?!" I grabbed him by the throat, lifted him up, and slammed him into the wall.

Toes Tapper: "W-Whhaat.. are you.."

I punched him in the stomach ten times. Rage, indescribable rage.

Toes Tapper: "Ughnmm.. no.. never.. would.." He coughed up blood.

K: "Applebloom? Sweetie Belle? Scootaloo!?" I choked him a bit tighter.

Toes Tapper: *NGH!* "The homeless one! Total.. who-"

Luna shifted into her full Nightmare form. Her incomprehensable rage caused whatever seal was over the rest of her power, to shatter like glass. Night or no night, her absolute white-hot burning rage brought out all of her powers. The sun dimmed visibly.

THAT brought Celestia. She teleported behind us. Before she could say a word, I spoke up.

K: "Cel.. what do we do to kidfuckers around here?!" I didn't look at her. "He molested SCOOTS!" I kneed him in the gut, and felt a rib give way.

Celestia: "..oh." She put her hoof over my shoulder. "Release."

I let him go.

Celestia: "Sister.."

Nightmare Moon: *Nightmare Voice* "HE HAS DONE THE UNTHINKABLE, SISTER! HE HAS VIOLATED THE INNOCENT!"

K: "He also molested Sunshine Smiles. And who knows how many others!?" I looked up at his wall.. of 'special dancers.' "Never mind. There's his victim list!" I pointed.

Celestia: "...I see." She moved ahead of us both.

Toes was just in a lump on the ground. Coughing, trying to breathe. I was sure I'd broken several ribs and ruptured his diaphragm. He needed a doctor, actually.

Celestia: "None have ever seen this form and lived." She said, just as coldly as I had.

Rage was something not new to Celestia. Neither was doling out some justice to those that deserved it. In a moment, she changed from Celestia, to the Holy Paladin of Light, Nightmare Moon's opposite form. Magic armor grew over her body, her wings became crystalline, her horn grew in length. She got taller. Taller than me.

Toes Tapper: *Ngh!* "You.. can't.."

HPOL: *Echoing boom* "YOU DARE TELL US WHAT WE CAN AND CANNOT DO!? YOU WORM! YOU FILTH! YOU SCUM!" Each insult was accentuated with invisible telekinetic impacts that produced momentary craters on his body. "FOR YOUR ULTIMATE CRIME, YOU WILL RECEIVE THE ULTIMATE PUNISHMENT! DEATH IS TOO GOOD FOR EVIL LIKE YOU!"

She fired a mega-sized bolt from her horn, and it impacted him. He screamed. Unearthly screams. His body became twisted and wrent from its form. He was being transmogrified.. but into what? My answer would come soon - she turned him into a chimeric beast of some sort. Parts from horses, eagles, other animals.. he was something to which there was no English word.

K: "Changed into the monster on the outside that you are on the inside." I nodded, grimly. "Poetic."

Monster: *Urgghhh* "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME!?" It could barely process what it was.

HPOL: "YOU HAVE BEEN PUNISHED!" She bellowed at his face.

K: "Nice. Nice." I nodded. "'Cept, one thing, Cel." I was being so casual about this.

HPOL: "YES?"

K: "I think death is exactly what it deserves." I raised my Morgan...

Part 2: Picking Up The Pieces

TIME: 05:35
DATE: War Day 461/10 Septimus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Twilight's Library, Ponyville

I was still numb. I just could not process all of this. I hadn't even reloaded my Morgan, it sat on the table, slide open. Luna was with me, Applejack was cuddled into me.. Harv had finally stopped crying. Script had to be drugged by Dr. Allcome.

Every friend I had, it seemed, was stuffed into Twilight's library. Celestia had stayed up all night just to give me the emotional support - despite our issues, she still had that strong Mommy vibe to her.

No one in Ponyville had ever experienced anything like this before.

Celestia: "Dear Me, I'm exhausted." She shook her head. "Extra coffee tomorrow.." She sighed.

K: "...it happened to me, too." I looked straight ahead, finally coming up with the voice to admit it.

Golden Harvest: "K!? Ye.. NOO!" She came over and hugged me. "Dear Celestia.. I.." She hugged me tight. I got more hugs from the others.

K: "It's true.." I was crying.. just flowing tears, no sobs. "..my uncle, when I was eight."

Luna: "We had no idea you held such pain, my love." Her wing came around my shoulders.

Applejack: "Honey.." She kissed my cheek.

Sunshine: "Explains why you went ballistic.." He frowned.

Norfy: "Something I'm sure you'd like to forget in the next life." He nodded.

Cosmic: "We don't think any less of you, K." He gave me a small smile, but I could see the sadess.

Jade: "I guess.. you had monsters in your world after all.." She sighed.

Gorcat: "Dude." He just shook his head in sorrow.

Dr. Allcome: "Oh, my stars.." He lowered his head, too.

Dr. Whooves: "Fascinating. But.. I am sorry it happened." He shrugged.

Derpy: "I'm sorry, K----." She sniffled a little. "At least you made sure Dinky wouldn't be around that freak.." She sighed. "..thank you for that."

Katrina: "I'm so sorry.. I feel so bad, now.." She was curled up in a defensive ball.

K: "Freaks like that.. I just want to kill them all." I looked up at Celestia. "Sorry I spoiled your poetic justice."

Celestia: "It's.. it's okay, K----. I understand, now, why." She shook her head slowly. "I accepted what you did the moment you did it, because I trust you." She looked down. "Now, I understand."

K: "I'm sorry I didn't detect him sooner. End him sooner." I looked up at Dr. Turner as she came down stairs. "The truth - how's Scoots?"

Dr. Turner: "She's a bit confused, yeah.. she knows it was wrong, it felt wrong, but fer th' time he was doin' it, she didn't have no one else. She's kinda shocked he didn't kidnap her." She shrugged. "Physically, there's some trauma, yeah, but I don't think its permanent. Apparently, he stopped right aroun' the time Harv took her in." She looked right at me. "Ya wanna talk about it?"

I gestured for her to have a seat.

K: "When it happened, I didn't know what to think. I didn't know men could do that to men. Boys. Whatever. It felt wrong, it felt.. uncomfortable. Then it was sticky, and he just kinda sighed." I shrugged. "I felt like I was dirty back there. Then, my grandmother came in, put two and two together, and chased him out of the house. No one told the police, but I'm sure.. somehow.. the family was warned. Or, they just knew what he was like. Because he was never allowed around me alone, or my male cousins, ever again. Except the few times my mother foolishly let him watch me as a teenager. By then, though, I'd taken to locking myself in my room to avoid him. He never tried anything after that, though."

(Side Note: Yes, this really did happen to me)

Dr. Turner: "You.. ah.. you come ta grips with that, then?" She tilted her head, like, drawing this out of me shouldn't have been this easy.

K: "In a way. Truth, I haven't thought about it since I got here. I didn't.. could not comprehend something like this was happening HERE of all places!" I hugged my knees like a child. "I'm sorry, Celestia."

Celestia: "You've nothing to apologise for. Sick ones like that are able to camouflage themselves very well. I fear our innate trust in each other, only aids them in their deceptions." She shrugged her wings. "Though, I will say, this is the first one I've seen in over a hundred years."

K: "I was told by.." I looked at the girls. "..someone that incest, while not common, does happen, mainly in tiny towns where no one would say anything about it. So, even if you haven't seen one in a hundred years, they exist." I looked directly at Pinkie.

Pinkie: "He's right." Her hair remained poofy. "My father was one." She shrugged. "Doc, is it wrong that I'm glad Trixie killed him? But I feel bad that he's dead at the same time?"

Dr. Turner: "Nah.. pretty natural, actually. He was yer pops, but he also abused.." She looked at me.

K: "Her sisters. Mainly one, and she'd get jealous if he went after the other. They're dead, now, so it doesn't matter." I shrugged.

Luna: "It is I that feels the most guilt.. I entrusted our daughter to that monster.." Starlight was asleep in her lap.

K: "If he'd touched her.." I shook my head. "..you would have had to drag me off him. I'd be skinning him alive, cooking him alive, and eating him right in front of him."

Gaze: "Ya did say ya tried us, suh.. uh.. K." He patted my knee. "Issareight, K."

K: "Yeah." I patted his head. "I trust you all. Even you, Doc." I looked at Turner. "You're still a bit Screw Loose to me, ya know." I smiled.

Dr. Turner: "Glad ya sees me that way, K." She nodded with a grin.

K: "Cheerilee?" I looked over at her, she was snugged into Mac's forelegs.

Cheerilee: "Yes, K?" Her tone was quite soft, and I'm sure she felt some guilt herself.

K: "I want to help you put together some basic 'good touch/bad touch' material to teach the kids. We had something like it in my schools, but.. I got mine far too late." I was still kinda hugging my knees. "I know it might seem.. paranoid.. but.."

Cheerilee: "Not at all, K----." She gave me a small grin. "I was hoping you could help.. I mean.. we.. I'd have no idea what to do or say.."

K: "Mmm.. sadly.. we need that in my world. That and what we called Drug Abuse Resistance Education. Saying 'no' to illicit drug use." I looked at Celestia. "I really hope my presence-"

Celestia: "Not another word." Mommy Tone. "You had absolutely nothing to do with Sunshine's problem - it happened long before you got here. And I'm sure, all of these other problems were just under the surface.. it's I who should apologise. For not knowing. And worse, for not having something in place to catch it. Being too optimistic that everything really IS just as happy as it looks on the outside. A GOOD monarch would have considered this wasn't the case..." She trailed off.

Twilight: "But.. Princess Celestia.. you have so many other things to consider. It's not your fault - there's only so much time in the day.."

Cheerilee: "I don't blame you, either. You're our Sun Goddess, but you're not perfect." She shrugged.

Mac: "M'Yup. Agree'n with Cheerilee." He nodded.

K: "You did say you're not Omnipotent. It seems, Your Highness, you're outvoted on the guilt trip." I gave her a small grin.

Celestia: *Small titter* "Seems that I am." She gave us ALL a very motherly look.

There was a lot of healing love in this room.

K: "I'm sorry, everyone. I never thought my emotional pain would come out like this." I was a bit better, but still...

Twilight: "It's alright, K." She patted me on the back. "We're here. We'll always be here."

The question was, would I?

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: The Big Event

TIME: 06:42 ERST
DATE: War Day 463/12 Septimus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Ponyville Square

MAJ Tankette Blinda: "MARINE HONOR GUARD! ATTEN-SHUN!"

The twenty four ponies of the Honor Guard Platoon stood as straight as statues. Chromed Parade Shermans with glistening chrome bayonets were at their shoulder. Their perfect Marine Blue uniforms were crisp, their pants as white as driven snow.

I watched them from the window as us Grooms got ready. Final preparations. I looked back at two of my best friends.

K: "We ready for this, gentlecolts?" I gave a grin as I fixed my tie.

Sunshine: "No. But I'm doing it anyway." He shrugged. "Can't be harder than asaulting a volcano."

Forest Spirit: "Yeah." He flicked a thread off his Marine Dress Blues. "Or taking over an island."

K: "Hey.." I put my fist out towards them. "Bros for life."

Sunshine: "Bros. For life." He put his hoof in.

Forest Spirit: "Bros for LIFE!" He put his in as well.

We tapped them together, solidifying our oath. Even with our high positions, we didn't know for sure if we'd see the end of the war alive.

Sunshine decided that, like I, he would wear a civilian tuxedo. He wasn't officially a Prince-Consort yet, and since I had eschewed my formal military uniform, so would he. Forest Spirit decided to wear his.

All three of us had Morgans on us tucked carefully in underarm holsters. You know, just in case.

There was a knock.

Dr. Allcome: "It's Doc, gentlemen. May I?"

K: "Come on in, Doc." I nodded at the door.

In he came, with our buitonnieres. He'd go about affixing them to our tuxes.

Dr. Allcome: "I'm honored you'd consider me a good enough friend, K, to be a Best Stallion.." He gave me a grin.

K: "You've saved me. You've helped me. My blood has been on your hooves. And you've done things against medical advice, because I insisted. You're a friend, Doc." I shrugged.

Sunshine: "I never did hear your first name, Doc." He looked at him.

Dr. Allcome: "Code. I usually went by Cody as a kid." He shrugged.

K: "Middle name Blue?" I tilted my head.

Dr. Allcome: "Yes, actually."

K: "Code Blue Allcome. That's.." *Wry chuckle* "..literally what they'd say if a patient was dying and they needed all hands on deck, at human hospitals."

Dr. Allcome: "I think, with you, K, I've lived up to that name." He gave me a smirk!

I put my arm around his neck gently.

K: "Sadly, Doc, I don't think you're done." I looked at Sunshine and Forest Spirit.

Dr. Allcome: "No, no, I don't think I am." He said rather casually.

K: "Mm.." I checked my watch. "Escorts here in three, gentlecolts. Get ready. Final.. er.. suit check." I chuckled.

We did our final fittings, and stood ready. There was a knock at the door and Tankette entered in her formal Marine Dress Blues. Which, I should point out, are a copy of the Blues in Colonel Williams' manual - so, mid-1980's. That means she's in a Yeoman's Hat and long(ish) skirt, but altered with standard black mirror polished shoes for both males and females, and white front hoofcaps instead of white gloves.

Blinda: "Future Prince-Consort Sunshine, General K, Commandant Spirit." She nodded formally. "The Royal Marines are prepared to escort you." She saluted Spirit, as he was in uniform.

Spirit: "Major!" He saluted back. "We are ready."

So, we proceeded towards the main part of the square, where a large red carpet had been laid out for us. We waited in the 'wings' for our opposite numbers.

When I saw Applejack, I was almost unable to contain my erection. Her wedding gown was a gorgeous white lace and sheet affair, accentuated with a bit of green, and a Zapapple Bloom for a corsage - which is blue at this time of year. White nylons came up her rear legs, ending under her dress. Her white garter was clearly visible on her left leg (and that's where she hid her Custer Special). To top it all off, she had a formal cowgirl hat in white straw, with a veil under it.

Pregnant or not, crowd or not, I wanted to drill her right there. I had to bite my lip to fight my erection. Cadence's dress was similar, but more embellished, and accentuated in pink instead. Redheart's dress was closer to Applejack's but with red accents. Both Cadence and Redheart had veil toppers on their heads to hold their veils in place.

Octavia's orchestra tuned up, then played the Wedding March.

We lined up in rank order.

Sunshine, as Prince-Consort to Her Royal Highness, The Crown Princess Cadence of the Crystal Kingdom.

Myself as General-Field Marshal, Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Equestrian Military.

Forest Spirit as Commandant of the Royal Equestrian Marine Force.

We stepped forwards to accept our brides-to-be. Cadence was blushing so hard.. I could feel Applejack's breaths coming fast and shallow. Behind me, I could hear Redheart's heart pounding.

Ahead of us, the ceremonial flower girls - Sweetie Belle, Applebloom, and Scootaloo - proceeded in their adorable dresses, casting flower petals at our feet. Apple blossoms for myself and Applejack. Roses for Cadence and Sunshine. Orchids for Forest Spirit and Redheart.

We proceeded up the red carpet, to our assigned places. Me to the right of Cadence and Sunshine, Forest Spirit to the left of us, before Father Waddle.

Behind us, the Ring Bearers. Redheart's nephew Mightyheart for her and Forest Spirit. Starlight Mint for myself and Applejack. Friskie Gemlace for Sunshine and Cadence.

We took our positions.

Fr. Waddle: "Ladies and Gentlecolts.. today, we come here, in the Presence of our Goddesses to celebrate the union of Holy Matrimony." He held his hooves out before us six. "Sunshine and Cadence. K---- and Applejack. Forest Spirit and Generosity Redheart. Do you all come here in the presence of Goddess Celestia and Goddess Luna, of your own free will? Without coercion, with love in your hearts?"

Grooms & Brides: "We do!"

Fr. Waddle: "Are you prepared, as you follow the path of matrimony, to honor, love and cherish each other for all of your days?"

Grooms & Brides: "We do!"

Fr. Waddle: "Are you prepared to raise your foals, in the love and harmony of Celestia's word?"

Grooms & Brides: "We do!"

Fr. Waddle: "Then, before we shall continue, let any who object to these unions, speak now, or forever hold thy peace..!"

Chrysalis: "I'D OBJECT BUT I ALREADY KILLED ONE OF HER LOVERS!"

Oh, that got EVERYONE to whip around and draw down. As practised, the Marines and Royal Guards went for the concealed anti-aircraft guns, pulled the tarps off, cranked them on target, and prepared to fire.

She had well over 700 weapons aimed at her in less than three seconds.

But, she was alone.

And wearing a very formal - if bug-y - dress.

Chrysalis: "WHAT?! Can't a girl crash a wedding?" She ignored all the guns drawn on her, and walked forwards, swaying her hips and coming right up to all six of us.

K: "What do you want?" I said flatly, Morgan aimed at her horn.

Chrysalis: "Oh.. couple things." She came right up to me. "From you, I want a kiss. Just one. Because after you marry the apple pony, there, I won't be able to taste your love." She tilted her head. "Can't take love from someone that's married!" She flicked her buggy tongue over her lips, then looked at Cadence. "From you, I want to give an apology." She paced over. "I took Shining Armor from you because I was jealous.. insanely jealous.. that someone could love you so hard. Anyone. So hard." She looked at the rest of us. "I killed him.. because I didn't want anyone to have him if I couldn't. I fell in love with him, too, Cadence." She actually bowed her head!

While looking down the sights of her own Morgan, Cadence replied..

Cadence: "I might accept. But. What are you up to?" She flicked a look at me.

Chrysalis: "You've defeated me." She looked straight at her, then over to Lord Sombra, and back again. "The greatest source of Love in this world is gone to me, now." She shrugged. "I could have brought my Hordes, but.." She looked back at the wedding party. "..no way they'd survive against that."

Cadence: "Are you saying you'll never bother us again?" She tilted her head just slightly.

Chrysalis: "No, no, not saying that.." She flicked her tongue again. "..just saying, I've lost out on the greatest prize for the time being. Until you die and another Prince and Princess must be chosen. That's our lot in life. So long as there are Changelings, there will be Chrysalis. So long as there's the Crystal Heart, I'll be right there, wanting it." She shrugged. "It's a balance. I can't kill you, or I lose the Crystal Heart forever. You getting married means I can't seduce it away from you. It won't stop me forever.. but for now.. partly because I've lost so many of my Changelings.. I must retire, sort of." She shrugged. "Let there be peace. But only for now." She narrowed her eyes, but bowed her head.

Cadence: "..I accept your apology." She lowered her gun.

The rest of us did, too.

K: "Applejack?" I looked at her. I would not kiss Chrysalis unless she agreed.

Applejack: "You try t'drain him dry, I'll blow yer damn head off." She warned, but gave her consent.

With that, Chrysalis moved over to me. Normally, we were somewhat near the same height, but I was up on a step. So, I had to lean over.. and she took that as a chance to fully sweep me down, and plunge her mouth on to mine. Despite what I thought it would feel like, her lips were actually soft. Her tongue was a bit slimy, but I expected that. We kissed. I could feel her feeding on me, but only a bit. A taste. As promised.

I could, however, hear several Stallions and colts kinda cheering me on, Bro-Code Like.

Applejack: "Awlright, that's enough, Sister!" She put her hoof on Chrysalis' shoulder.

Dear Lord, I had an erection. I knew, then, that, somehow, she was going to end up getting Hot Monkey Dick. Not by my intentions, but because she KNEW she just turned me on, and would not stop until she tasted the act, even if she couldn't feed from it after today.

She just straight dropped me, and bowed to Applejack.

Chrysalis: "You have no idea how much he really loves you." She looked very jealous. "I tasted it.. it's.." She looked down at me. "..you're both very lucky." She sniffed a bit.

With that, and without further incident, she trotted over to the Royal Row.. and stood before Celestia.

Chrysalis: "Come on, I *am* the Queen of the Changelings." She tilted her head, playfully.

Celestia, without a word, but with a glare in her eye, scooted over to give her room on the bench.

Chrysalis: "You may continue!" She announced.

Fr. Waddle: "My Stars and Sunbeams.. in all my years." He wagged a hoof at Chrysalis fearlessly. "That was very dramatic and rude, young lady."

Chrysalis: *Pfft* "I'm older than you!"

Fr. Waddle: "...oh, I doubt that, my child.." He gave his eyebrow a twitch. "Anyhow.. now that I've completed the first part of the ceremony, allow me to speak the Liturgy.."

He popped open his bible, and flipped to the correct page.

Fr. Waddle: "It shall be good that Stallions shall marry - for each Stallion, a Mare of virtue. For each Mare, a Stallion of strength and forebearance. The Husband shall fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and his wife to her husband. The bodies of both, belong to both, as both walk together. Do not deprive yourselves of each other, save that you pray to the Sun and Moon. Then come together, that you may resist the pull of Tartarus and its temptations together, as Husband and Wife! It is the great wish that all were so fortunate. Remember, each Pony has their own unique gifts - one has this, and another that."

He turned the page.

Fr. Waddle: "Know that together, both are sanctified before the Sun and Moon - whether the husband believes and the wife does not, or the reverse. For the act of union gives holy salvation to both, as their children shall be born holy and clean before the Light and the Night. Know that Celestia has called for us to live in Peace - yet our struggles are many, thy union brings a unitement. For who can say if the husband shall save the wife, or the wife her husband?"

The Liturgy reminded me of 1 Corinthians 1-16, but changed quite a bit to cast the union between the married as a team against evil, not speaking of spiritual salvation so much, and skipping any mention of those burning with passion getting married even if they're widowed, and remaining chaste otherwise. He turned the page to the last section he'd picked out..

Fr. Waddle: "Entreat me not to leave you, or to turn back from following after you. For wherever you go, I will go. And wherever you lay to sleep, so will I. Your battles shall be my battles, and together we shall be victorous. Your people shall be my people. The Sun and Moon ours both. It shall be that only death shall draw us apart - and where you die, I will die inside. Where you are buried, so shall I be buried."

Father Waddle looked up at us all. The Homily was next.

Fr. Waddle: "It has been my great privilege to serve Celestia these many years, and to unite so many happy couples. However, this is a special union for me. K---- K--- and Applejack have both been a magnificent example of true love. Species does not matter - nor does his two legs to her four. Their courage and skill together, as a team, has overcome so much, and helped so many. His other friends, with him now, are proof of this. I know.. in my heart and soul.. going forwards, you six.. will lead us all to a new era of peace, and harmony." He smiled broadly, looking at us, as he finished the Homily.

As we had done the Confirmation of Intent at the beginning, he moved on to the Rite of Consent.

Fr. Waddle: "You to be wed, take your right hooves together. Or, hand, in your case, my Son." He nodded to me.

The wedding party had a small giggle. In a nod to humility and humbleness, we went in reverse rank order.

Fr. Waddle: "Do you, Forest Spirit, take Generosity Redheart, to be your lawful wedded wife? From this dawn forwards, in sickness and in health. In poorness and in Wealth. For all the days of your life, until Death do ye part?"

Forest Spirit: "I do!" He stood a bit taller.

Fr. Waddle: "Generosity Redheart. Do you take Forest Spirit to be your lawfully wedded husband? From this dawn forwards, in sickness and in health. In poorness and in Wealth. For all the days of your life, until Death do ye part?"

Redheart: "I do!" She beamed.

He turned to me and Applejack.

Fr. Waddle: "Do you, K---- K---, take Applejack, to be your lawful wedded wife? From this dawn forwards, in sickness and in health. In poorness and in Wealth. For all the days of your life, until Death do ye part?"

K: "I do!" I raised my head.

Fr. Waddle: "Applejack. Do you take K---- K--- to be your lawfully wedded husband? From this dawn forwards, in sickness and in health. In poorness and in Wealth. For all the days of your life, until Death do ye part?"

Applejack: "Ah do!" She stated assertively.

He turned to Sunshine and Cadence last.

Fr. Waddle: "Do you, Sunshine Smiles, take Cadence, to be your lawful wedded wife? From this dawn forwards, in sickness and in health. In poorness and in Wealth. For all the days of your life, until Death do ye part?"

Sunshine: "I do!" He pawed the ground with his off-hoof.

Fr. Waddle: "Cadence. Do you take Sunshine Smiles to be your lawfully wedded husband? From this dawn forwards, in sickness and in health. In poorness and in Wealth. For all the days of your life, until Death do ye part?"

Cadence: "I do!" She smiled broadly, and blushed.

Fr. Waddle: "Place the rings upon each other, to signify your Unions!"

We each took the rings from the ring bearers. Grooms first, then Brides. Jackie had to.. uh.. almost fellate my finger to get my ring on. As if I wasn't hard enough already.

Fr. Waddle: "THEN! ALL YE, HEAR ME NOW! By the power vested into me, Father Waddle of Ponyville, by our Goddesses, Celestia and Luna, I pronounce thee ALL to be Stallion - or Man - and Wives!" He smiled, then looked at us all. "Oh, you may kiss your brides."

The cheering could be heard all the way to Canterlot. I grabbed Jackie up in my arms completely, and showed her more kiss and love than I ever had before. Forest Spirit, likewise, swept Redheard into his hooves and kissed her. Sunshine and Cadence took the longest, with Sunshine lifting her veil slowly, and kissing her tenderly.

We were married. A horse and a human. What would MY God have to say about this?!

Part 4: No Honeymoon in Paradise

TIME: 09:25 ERST
DATE: War Day 463/12 Septimus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Ponyville

We were celebrating. The fun was being had in full force. Rather crazily, Kiwi Spritz caught Cadence's bouquet. Rarity caught Applejack's. Campanula caught Redheart's. The garters? We handed those out personally - I gave Applejack's to Twilight. Forest Spirit gave Blinda, Redheart's. And Dr. Turner of all people got Cadence's.

The Orchestra had given way to Vinyl Scratch's dance tunes, and she WAS keeping it rather tame. We were all going wild, and having a fantastic time. The cakes.. all three of them.. were actually fed to the partners carefully and respectfully - though Applejack made a show of engulfing her forkfull all the way to my fingers, showing off her oral skills in a clean way, much to the whoops and hollers of her girls and many boys.

I finally had a seat. A bit worn out, but otherwise happy.

Applebloom: "Guess ah'kn call'ya Big Brother fer real now, huh?" She thumped into me and nuzzled.

I pet her mane, and hugged her.

K: "I wish your parents were here to see this.. but they're looking down on your big sister right now. And you." I smiled.

Applebloom: "D'aw." She hugged me.

Starlight came up and got between us.

Starlight: "MY daddy!" She grinned broadly, and offered Applebloom a tart. "Makes me yer auntie! Here, eat up!"

Given that Applebloom and Starlight were both 13, this was a BIT odd.. eh, oh well.

Applebloom: "Thanks.. Auntie Starlight!" They BOTH giggled.

K: "You two are too cute for words!" I chuckled.

Chrysalis came up, and shoo'd them.

Chrysalis: "Go on, you two. Go play." She actually smiled. "You know, I don't just feed on romantic love." She looked at me. "I can absorb love from the environment, though it's much less effective." She shrugged.

K: "Why are you being so Nine-to-Five Villain on me?" I asked flatly.

Chrysalis: "It's as I said. I can't win, now. I may as well accept it. You have no idea how long I'm going to live, K." She gave me a look, and flicked her tongue at me. "She'll die, you know. You might not." She meant of old age. "I'll be here when she's gone.." She leaned in to me..

..only to have Applejack shove her away.

Applejack: "See here, sister! I'm only 22! I gots LOTS'o years left in ME 'fore I'm ready t'be put t'pasture!" She snorted. "So, y'all stay clear'a MAH STALLION." Eye twitch.

Chrysalis: "Oh, my the jealousy!" She tittered. "You two are so cute together." She shrugged. "Hey, call me if you want a threesome." She leaned in to AJ. "I *do* swing both ways.. and that's an offer just because I'm a sexual deviant."

Applejack: *Flatly* "Not if yew was th' last pussy on Equus besides mine." But.. she offered her a piece of wedding cake. "Y'all're offerin' peace, tho.. so's.. may as well be neighborly."

Chrysalis: "OOoooo.. wedding cake! Never had it." She accepted the plate. "Thank you, Applejack." She tilted her head. "I won't apologize for the ones killed in battle, but I am sorry about Shining Armor. I've never been in love before." She looked down at the cake.

Twilight: "I suppose.. I should forgive you, too.." She paced up with her parents, Nite Light and Twilight Velvet. "We all should." She looked back at them. "We had no idea he'd touched your heart like that."

Chrysalis: "It's true, Twilight Sparkle. I'm over a hundred, now. I've drained many ponies. But I've never once really felt anything for them." She looked right at the three of them. "Maybe if I hadn't been so foalish, so stupid, so focused on wanting to conquer everything and just accepted what I had.." She looked down. "..instead of letting my jealousy eat me alive."

Twilight: "We get it.." She lowered her head. "..I knew my brother was special."

Chrysalis: "OH!" She looked up at Twilight. "There is.. one thing I can do for you." She leaned in and kissed her.

When they broke away, Twilight was tearing up.

K: "What..?" I looked at Chrysalis.

Chrysalis: "I gave her a piece of her Brother's Love back. When I drain Love Essence, I get all of it - romantic and nonromantic. His love for her was absolute." She bowed her head.

K: "Yeah.." I looked at her, and stood up. "Your Highness, may I have this dance?" I gave Applejack a look, like, trust me, please.

We danced. I got Chrysalis in a slow dance, together, giving her, AS her, a piece of what it means to be adored and loved a different way. Not just physical.

I was serious about making actual peace with this bug. If I can't have her as an ally, I at least wanted her OUT of the war as a co-beligerrant against us.

I danced with a few other ladies, too. Celestia, Golden Harvest, Radio Active, Webley Weaver, Fluttershy, Twilight.. Twilight's MOM (has got it goin' on!), and of course, I saved the two "prime dances" for Luna and Applejack.. and the follow-up one for Starlight, whom I didn't have to carry in my arms, but she still had to stand on my feet a bit.

It struck me that in just two years, she'd be eligable for enlistment.. and I prayed the war would be over long before that.

When we got to the gifts, the trouble arrived...


TIME: 12:00 ERST

From the Train Station ran a small delegation of officials from Prance. Though Crown Princess Escargot was here, these were military officers. An Air Force major, an Army colonel, and a Navy commander. Complete with enlisted aides.

Prench Army Colonel: "^Marechal^ K!" He ran up to us, and noticed Celestia next to me. "Forgive me, your royal highness." He bowed to Celestia, and bowed to his own liege. "Crown Princess, forgive, please." He pulled a paper from his topcoat and handed it to me.

K: "It's a report.. by telegraph. Tirek's forces have invaded Quirtbeck." I looked at the Prench officers. "Which Prance has a Commonwealth status with.." I looked for Havoc. "HAVOOOOC! GET YOUR WIFE! WE'RE GOING BACK!"

Havoc: "TO CANIDA?" He shouted from the growing crowd.

K: "QUIRTBECK!" I shouted back.

Havoc: "DARNIT!" He snorted.

K: "What can we do to help?" I looked between the officers and Princess Escargot.

Princess Escargot: "Prance would appreciate assistance from any members of the NEIGHTO alliance for this, ^Marechal.^" She bowed her head to me and Celestia.

K: "I'll take care of it." I nodded. "GAZE! NORFY! COSMIC! GET THE TEAM TOGETHER!" I looked at Forest Spirit. "Closest units to the Quirtbeckian border?" I asked.

Forest Spirit: "Detrot Militia and the 3rd Battalion Royal Army." He responded. "3rd Battalion's in Flint, though, not Detrot. It'd take them a while."

K: "NORFY! GAZE! RAISE THE DETROT MILITIA!" I called out, and nodded to the Prench officers. "If you'll excuse me."

Applejack: "I know, I know, I gotta stay behind!" She stopped me, and embraced me. Tightly. "Yew better come back t'me, y'hear?" She said, so softly.

K: "Always, My Love." I kissed her.

The War waits for no one. What I wanted to know, is, what was Tirek's intentions? An invasion of Quirtbeck didn't make any sense to me, at the time. The area was a few cities, some towns, some mines of common ores, a bit of oil, plenty of farms.. and lots and lots of wilderness.

I didn't know if I'd get the answers I sought, but I did know that I'd fight him, and win.

[End of Part 4]


Part 5: Other North

TIME: 12:41 Quirtbeck Eastern Standard Time
DATE: War Day 466/15 Septimus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: La Salle County, Region Nord, Republique du Quirtbeck.

The train tracks ended at an outpost in the middle of nowhere. After that, it was literally nothingness. We'd have to hoof it over 70 km to reach the northen outpost that had spotted Tirek's forces.

With me was Gaze, Norfy, Cosmic, Ambrosia and Jim Beam (by the way, they got married while I was gone) along with the Ponyville Militia Engineer Platoon, Havoc and Bella Donna, Gorcat, Jade, Dr. Allcome, Nurse Sweetheart (since Redheart was pregnant), Dusty Dunes (who volunteered, and had come back with us from Las Pegasus), Gilda, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Fluttershy.

We brought with us from the Detrot Militia one Infantry company, one Artillery company, and their Ranger Company. The nearby Deerborne Militia would cover the missing units. Interestingly, unlike on Earth, Deerborne was a bit of a distance from Detrot and was a farming community, much like Ponyville was to Canterlot.

The 4th Battalion of the Royal Army would be here in a week.

K: "Brose, Jim.." I looked at the terrain. "..seems pretty flat, to me." I shrugged. "How long'd it take to cut a cordoury road or something, to the fort?"

Ambrosia: "About a week, if we all pitched in and you just sent the Artillery and your team on ahead." She shrugged. "I'll need the Rangers and Infantry for pony-power."

Jim: "Seems 'bout right." He patted me on the back. "Never did thank'ya fer keepin' my girl safe in Neighpon."

K: "Yeah, well, your wedding gift makes up for it. The Apple Farmhouse needs.. to be.. bigger for me." I chuckled. "I don't want to spend my post-war years hunched over."

Jade: "Well, I'm here." She looked at me. "This is really.. kinda.."

Gorcat: "Come on, Jade! This is fun. Besides, you might get a shot at Scorpan." He shrugged.

Gorcat was taking advantage of his Griffonic size and carrying an Abrams machine gun.

K: "I want to thank you again-"

Gorcat: "I still owe you." He corrected me. "It's a life debt. You, as far as my religion is concerned, either rescued me from Tarjas or Drachma. Either way, you gave me a chance to set things right. That's going to mean a lot of killing." He snickered. "For the Good Guys, this time."

K: "Right, yeah. You, Gilda, Dash and Fluttershy fly ahead about half a kilometer at all times, and scout out everything around us in a 40-degree arc. I have no idea what Tirek's doing up here, or why he wants to be here, so we have to be ready for everything and anything." I motioned.

Gilda: *Tch* "Think you can keep up, Cousin?" She was flicking her tailfeathers at him.

Gorcat: "I'll out-fly YOU, Woman!" He grinned, and the four of them took off.

I let Dr. Allcome come up beside me.

K: "Which one you think she'll choose? Gorcat or Gorlamb?" I tilted my head.

Dr. Allcome: "No idea, K." He chuckled. "She certainly seems to have found her confidence, though."

K: "Alright. COMMAND TEAM! ARTILLERY! FORM UP! THE REST OF YOU, REPORT TO AMBROSIA AND JIM!" I commanded.

Off we went, into the wilderness. With a healthy team marching for eight hours a day, counting breaks, and time to set up bivouac, it'd take us about three days to reach the Fort. This area was so unsettled and wild, there were no known villages, hamlets, or encampments in the region. About halfway there, there was supposedly an abandoned gold mining operation. We'd arrived so late in the day, though, we'd only be good for about 24 kilometers. So, we'd be sleeping in the wild tonight, and hopefully at the abandoned mine the second night.

Quite literally, NOTHING happened. It was just a very long walk, done with some chitter-chatter between the troops, occasional cadence calls, and an occasional song.

TIME: 18:42 QEST
LOCATION: 23km from railhead, 55km from fort.

K: "ALRIGHT! Fall out! Take five! First Wagon Train, I want you cutting trees after a break. Second Wagon Train, set up camp. First Section, set up the guns in defensive formation. Second Section, forage. Third Section, check with Gilda, gather water. HQ Squad, set up security - Dusty, Norfy, Gaze, Havoc, Bella Donna, Jade, give 'em a hand. Doc, Coz, you're with me."

I instructed, and we set to rest. Well, except me, Coz and Dr. Allcome. With them, I climbed up a small cliff face, and motioned for the radio that Cosmic had with him.

Cosmic: "Going to see if we can contact the Railhead?"

K: "Yeap. We've got a good, clear line of sight." I grabbed the mic, and tuned the set. C> "Artillery Team to Railhead - this is Alpha Actual to Papa Echo, do you read me?"

Ambrosia: C> "Papa Echo Actual. Read you four-by-five, Alpha. Go ahead."

K: C> "Roger, four-by-five. We have reached bivouac, and are setting up camp. How read, over?"

Ambrosia: C> "Papa Echo Actual reads. Have reached bivouac and are setting up camp."

K: C> "Affirmative, Papa Echo. Will check in at zero seven hundred. Alpha Actual, out."

Ambrosia: C> "Ten-four, Alpha Actual."

K: "Better than I'd hoped. The Prench warned us that there were iron and nickel deposits in the region. The way they suggested it, sounds like meteors. Meaning that iron is magnetic from shock. Which would play hell with radio signals." I shrugged.

Cosmic: "Roger that, sir." He grinned up at me. "We're back in business."

Dr. Allcome: "Yes, indeed. Quite the business, I should say. Whom commands the fort, K?" He asked, looking up from sorting his medbag.

K: "A pony named Sacquet." I shrugged.


TIME: 18:36 QEST
DATE: War Day 467/16 Septimus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: 12km from Foreign Legion Fort, Region Nord, Republique du Quirtbeck.

We made good time. The entire day was utter boredom. Nothing, at all, happened. The scouts reported no activity. There was nothing, not a peep, from Tirek or any of his Lieutenants. Whatever was going on here, this wasn't part of it. As such, we kept a good pace.

We got to the Bivouac Site at the old Gold Mine just short of the fort, less than a dozen kilometers. If I wanted to push it, we could be there before midnight. I decided to make camp, instead.

K: "Alright, Ponies, same as last night." I nodded. "Norf, when the other teams are done, come see me. I want to take a look in that Mine. Just because it's here and even if it's a dead end, I want it eliminated as a clue or source of suspicion. Bring Dusty, Cosmic, and Gorcat with you." I directed.

Norfy: "You got it, K." Off he took.

One of the things I was glad for in our military was that we hadn't created an Officer Corps with an entitled mentality. One would just as readily see an Officer dig a trench as a Private. My own inspiration in this end had something to do with it. Our lack of an established military tradition helped, too. In this way, Equestria's military had much in common with the Revolutionary American military - though they DID inherit an entitled officer class from professional former British soldiers, the ones that weren't (for example, Francis Marion) bore the risks of their enlisted, and did many of the same labors.

I hoped to continue that as best as possible going forwards. While rank was important in determining leadership and responsibility, I didn't want it used as a shield against manual labor, understanding, friendship, and cameraderie.

After a couple of hours, camp was set up. It helped that some of the structures for the gold mine were still standing and servicable, so tents weren't needed, save to cover gaps in the ceiling. Forage was simple - the ponies could run on much simpler foodstuffs than I, and I had a few days basic ration enhancements along with (mainly meat jerky to add to soup for protien, some preserves, and what was essentially trail mix) for my own personal dietary needs. This to add to ration oats, corn and barley.

Unlike normal horses, these Ponies needed a more balanced diet, and were more human in that regard. While they could survive a long while on naught but Ration Oats, Barley and Corn, with straight up grazing if they had to, or hay, they did better if they had fresh vegetables and fruit. As I'd said before, they're mostly vegetarian, with the vast majority of the pre-war population being Lacto-Ovo Vegetarians (those that consumed dairy and egg, but no meat), and besides that, the main meats available were poultry (chicken, duck, goose) and ham.

Norfy returned with Dusty and supper for the three of us.

K: "Good idea, it's getting late." I shrugged. "We'll just check it out a little - if it's important, we'll mark it on the map."

Dusty: "Norfy tells me that humans are more carnivorous than we are." She said with an inquisitive air.

K: "It's true. For a human, a truly balanced diet will consist of a lot of meat, some carbs, and vegetables. Good foods for us besides meat are corn and potatoes. Fruit is important, too, but not as much as the rest." The 'Food Guide Pyramid' would disagree, but the science behind it was questionable at best.

Dusty: "I find that interesting.. I grew up in the city, so, we ate a pretty diverse diet. My father was a casino worker. My mother worked at a cafe." She tilted her head. "So, we got a lot of free food from both places."

K: "And it was aimed at a very diverse crowd. Griffons, ponies, donkeys, zebra, and so on." I nodded.

Dusty: "Mmhmm." She ate her Ration Stew carefully.

K: "Want some Turkey to go in that?" I offered.

Dusty: "Sure." She held out her bowl.

I added some of my Turkey Jerky to it.

She ate that and seemed to like this better. This was a bit of a change for her - going from a 9-to-5 fighting job as a Gendarmes SWAT officer, to a 24-hour Soldier as part of my Command Team that was out in the field and had to eat whatever was available.

After we were finished, Norfy took care of the dishes, and we set out for the Mine.

One advantage time had given me was a more stable flashlight, based on Crystal Kingdom technology - a magic-rechargable crystalline flashlight. Showing me that not every problem, here, had a scientific solution immediately available.

We got to the entrance, and I took a peek inside.

K: "Deserted, alright." I nodded. "Makes me wonder."

Dusty: "Want me to take point? I literally trained for this." She gave me a grin.

K: "Go ahead. Norf, you've got the rear."

Norfy: "Of course." He nodded, and made his Bradley ready.

Dusty moved in carefully, probing the ground with one hoof, as the other held her Morgan in front of her, moving on three legs. It was clear she'd trained for operations in caves and mines - and I was reminded that Las Pegasus was originally a mining town before the Mob showed up to make it a Gambler's haven, just like Las Vegas back home.

Dusty: "Floors seem stable. I don't detect any weakness.. I think they went straight in, didn't bother with up and down. I don't see any elevators or ramps, either." She said as she moved in carefully. "Odd, though.. either this mine wasn't very productive, or they didn't really bother spreading out. Orr..."

She moved to a wall, holstered her pistol, and pulled her knife. She scraped the wall a bit and examined the dust.

K: "Well?" I looked over at the dust.

She sniffed, then licked it. Scientific process.

Dusty: "..this is Iron Pyrite. Fool's Gold." She shook her head. "Now this mine REALLY doesn't make any sense. Why go so far in, if it's just Fool's Gold?" She tilted her head and looked towards the mine shaft.

Norfy: "Perhaps they thought gold could be found deeper, if they kept digging?" He tilted his head.

K: "Good thought, but no, you don't find gold by Iron Pyrite deposits." I shrugged.

Dusty: "You know your stuff." She looked at me as she put her knife back.

K: "Humans don't get special talents like ponies do. We have to know a lot about a lot, in order to function. As we say, specialization is for insects." I shrugged.

Dusty: "Oh, really?" She gave me a bit of a look. "Explains a lot."

Norfy: "And the rare Blank Flanks in Pony scoiety are often similar - they may examine a LOT of subjects before they find their calling. It's incredibly rare, but it does happen." He looked at me.

Dusty: "..ah... yeah." She looked down.

K: "She was a Blank before she joined the Gendarmes, Norfy." I shrugged.

Norfy: "OH! I'm sorry, Sergeant. I meant no offense." He apologetically upturned his hoof.

Dusty: "It's okay." She shook her head. "I found my calling, now." And grinned at us.

K: "Best guesses, Sergeant. I don't want to spend too much time, here." I nodded.

Dusty: "We should examine this place better, when we have time. I don't think there's any danger in here - nothing from the enemy - but something's strange, here, alright." She shrugged.

K: "I'll take it. Alright, let's get back to camp. Norf, mark this on the map." I nodded.

Norfy: "Done."

With that, we headed back to camp. Gold Mine indeed! Something was fishy, here, but we hadn't the time to find out what. In the morning, we'd head to the Fort, and our mission.
