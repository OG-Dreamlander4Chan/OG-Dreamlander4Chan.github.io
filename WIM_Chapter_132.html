Part 1: Funny Feathers

TIME: 13:24 GMT
DATE: War Day 1006/4 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Mount Airs, Occupied Nation of Hippogriffia/Marelantis


The Orghuzian Admiral (Amir al-Bahd - Admiral of the Ocean/Seas, equal to an OF-10) was being seen-to. AJ had him tied up. Trixie and Dusk were examining the Repository. Broken and Seaspray were keeping watch.

Dusty: "Mmm." She slid up on me, and hugged me from behind. "Some adventures you take a gal on."

Fazzad: "What this? You have HAREM?" He was surprised.

Applejack: "Only 'cuz mah stallion's'a most Alpha of 'em all." She cocked a brow at him.

Fazzad: "..amazing." He blinked, and looked down, then up. "I did not think horse would have such things. We are told you have only one mate."

K: "Only under normal circumstances. The best of us have two or more." I nodded to Dusk. "He has two - one of them isn't here right now, though."

Fazzad: "Hah!" He smirked. "I know Tirek tell many lies. But, Gold does not lie, you see?"

K: "Indeed." I lowered my head, and a thought came to mind. "Are you in the Royal Family, Amir?" After all, he's a full Admiral - he had to have connections.

Fazzad: "The Sultan is my 3rd Cousin." He nodded proudly.

K: "I see." I smirked a bit. "Ever thought of being Sultan yourself?"

Fazzad: "FAH!" He laughed. "I am 16th in line for the throne!" He shook his head.

K: "That.." I got all Chicago for a minute. "..just means I have to whack 15 camels." And shrugged.. just a tiny bit.

Fazzad: "You joke." He wasn't angry.

K: "Maybe." I shrugged again. "Depends on how good of a friend you can be." I made my face plain. "If for some reason I manage to install you as Sultan, I want an immediate non-aggression pact. You don't have to fight Tirek, but you need to STOP fighting US." I nodded to him.

Fazzad: "AHAH!" He laughed again. "Alright, Human! You make me Sultan, you get that, and rights to use our ports and cities for safety and trade! But! I think you not be able to do this!" He grinned at me.

K: "Tirek hasn't told you what I can do, has he?" I tilted my head. "I want that promise in writing."

Fazzad: "You.. you are serious!" He grew serious as well. "Huh." And nodded a bit. "Alright. Give me times to thinks on this." He lilted his head to the side a bit. "You are serious, and.. perhaps we can be.. friends." He smirked a bit. "Sultan Fazzad.." And grinned. "SULTAN.." And smiled.

K: "Think about it. I'm already plotting with a Khyangese general to assist him into a similar position." I smirked. "You could be next. And favorable trade with the rest of the world when we beat Tirek." I shrugged just a bit.

Fazzad: "Mmmmmmmm.." He smiled a bit, and I saw that gleam in his eye. "..I think I might like this."

K: "Alright. You think, I'm going to go look for the Icarus Feather." I nodded.

Fazzad: "Ah! Is in hidden chamber beneath main display floor. You must unlock it with a stone dais. Second room from the right." He narrowed his eyes, greedily.

K: "Mmm." I smirked. "Alright." I nodded to Dusty. "Keep an eye on our guest."

Dusty: "You got it, lover." She leaned into the whole Harem thing real hard - it seemed to impress our new 'guest.'

Applejack and I went over to the room indicated. The rest of the team was there already.

K: "Our guest told me how to find it." I nodded to Seaspray. "He says there's a stone dais, and the chamber is beneath the floor."

Seaspray: "Sounds.. right? I guess?" He shrugged. "I was here one time, as a kid. It's been 35 years since then."

K: "I getcha." I pointed to the floor. "Trixie? Dusk?"

Dusk: "On it, K." He nodded.

The two of them basically did a "magical feeler" spell along the floor. After a bit, they both came to the center of the room, where a broken stone pillar was.

Trixie: "This has to be the dais." She nodded. "But.. I'll be honest, K, I have no idea how to activate the mechanism."

Dusk: "It's damaged - that doesn't help matters." He sniffed it, and prodded with his magic.

K: "Let me see."

I nodded to them, and stepped forwards, feeling the broken top of the dais. Finally, FINGER HOLES! Makes senses - Hippogriffs have fingers. I slid mine in there, and managed to press 4 of the 5. A simple dig into my tool pouch for a pencil, and I reached the last one. It clicked. With Dusk's help, I was able to rotate it 35 degrees, and the floor itself slid open about 5 feet in front of us.

A large display bed slid up, and there, under glass, was a single, absolutely perfect feather.

Seaspray: "That's the Icarus Feather." He nodded. "It's supposed to imbue the wielder with true flight." He shrugged. "I can only guess why the Queen wants it."

K: "If she's playing a part in the legend, then, possibly to give to me, to imbue the Sword of Rainbow's Light." I shrugged. "I don't want to presume, but it seems likely."

Dusk: "Flight is one thing - how well can you breathe up there?" He cocked a brow.

K: "Ehhh.. supposedly, humans can breathe well enough up to 10,000 feet? To not die? But even if I DO get True Flight, I'm not risking more than a few hundred feet at best. And only for short bursts, if I can help it." I flapped my arms a bit. "If my God intended me to fly unassisted, I would have been born with wings, or so the saying goes back on Earth." I smirked. "Seriously, though, I'll get Gilda and Dash to give me some lessons - we all know that if we GET a something, we end up NEEDING that something." I nodded to them.

Applejack: "Y'all're right about that, hun." She shrugged. "Fer now, let's git that feather an' git back to the sea cave."

Broken: "Yes, I.. don't relish going back under the water, but.." He shrugged. "..if I must."

K: "Actually, Seaspray, I want you and me to go back to the Queen and hand it over." I nodded. "After we secure that Orghuzian Torpedo Boat on the shore." I looked at Dusk. "We DO have a sailor with us."

Rainbow McSherbet: "That's ME!" He beamed a grin. "I'm sure I can figure out how to work 'er."

K: "After I return the feather and come back, provided the Queen hasn't any other pressing matters for me, we can take the ship as a Prize and sail to friendly waters in her." I looked to Seaspray. "We'll be back as soon as we can be - and you can take the time meanwhile to pick out two dozen of your best troops, for us to train." I nodded to him.

Seaspray: "Twenty-three, General. I intend to follow your example and lead them from the front - retaking our home is an honor, but it's also a danger. I don't intend to send our people to war without understanding it, in person, first." He nodded firmly to me.

Dusk: "I like this guy." He smirked. "Reminds me of you."

K: "I take that as a compliment." I nodded. "You, too." I gestured to him.

Dusk: "Eh, well.." He shrugged.

K: "Alright, we got what we came for. Let's have a look at the Torpedo Boat. Untie our guest and bring him with." I nodded, casually, but then looked right at Dusk. "He so twitches wrong.." I raised my eyebrows.

Dusk: "Right through the dome. Gotcha." He smirked.

Now, we just.. needed to get out of here. I hoped we could meet up with an allied fleet, or, barring that, get to an allied island or something. Sardineigha shouldn't be too far.

And Fazzad? Well, appealing to his greed might mean one less ally for Tirek.

We'd have to see.

Part 2: On Wings of Friends

TIME: 14:44 GMT
DATE: War Day 1006/4 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Mount Airs, Occupied Nation of Hippogriffia/Marelantis

We got down to the beach area, where the Orghuz Torpedo Boat was semi-beached. Almost the entire crew was disembarked and had been killed in action in the repository. There were a couple still hanging around.

K: "You mind?" I nodded to them, with my team concealed behind some rocks.

Fazzad: "Eh. It matters not." He shrugged. "They would not surrender, you know."

K: "Thought not." I nodded to Dusk. "You and me. Take the left one."

Dusk: "You got it." He nodded back.

We lined up our shots, and fired at almost the same instant. They dropped. We advanced. Once we got to where the torpedo boat was beached, we clambered aboard. Not my first time on one of these things, either.

Rainbow scurried up and launched himself into the two Camels manning the forward gun turret, using his prosthesis as a short sword, gutting one, and neck-stabbing the other, before reattaching it, and getting the third one that came up from the side, with a few shots from his captured Abdul SMG.

Up to the bridge, I drew the Sword of Rainbow's Light, charged into the cabin, and impaled the Ship's Captain on my blade before he could react. As he fell, I leaned over and grabbed the handle of his Cutlass, and let it slide out of its sheath.

K: "Rainbow." I motioned for him to come forwards. "The enemy captain's sword. This ship is your prize." I placed it in his hooves.

Rainbow McSherbet: "FAR OUT!" He practically vibrated with happiness. "Say, you think I could keep her? Like, permanently? And do some upgrades? We could use her as an expeditionary HQ boat." He nodded.

K: "Good thinking." I nodded. "Dusk, Broken, check the radio." I turned back to Rainbow. "She's your ship. What shall you name her?"

Rainbow McSherbet: "Hmm.. HMS Bounty! Because she's a bounty of a prize." He nodded, grinning, nearly giddy.

K: "Heh. Okay.. okay.. just.. make sure we don't have a mutiny." I smirked.

Rainbow McSherbet: "..huh?!" He cocked a brow at me.

K: "Never mind!" I smiled, patting his shoulder. "It's from an Earth book." I nodded to him. "Enjoy your ship, Captain."

Dusk: "Got the radio working." He nodded, handing me the mic.

K: C> "Alpha Actual to any NEIGHTO Call Sign, come back." I hoped.. someone..

Rainbow Dash: C> "ACTUAL!? THIS IS ALPHA SIX! HOLY CELESTIA, YOU'RE ALIVE?!"

Golden Wattle: C> "Alpha Three-One! HEY MATE! Did everyone make it?!"

Fluttershy: C> "Alpha Four! I'm so glad to hear you're okay!"

Gilda: C> "Alpha Two-Zero! HEY ACTUAL!"

Adm. Tortellini: C> "This is Rex Actual! MI AMICO! YOU LIVE!"

VAdm. Goodenough: C> "Windsor Actual. It is most delightful to hear your voice, Alpha."

Adm. Lauzun: C> "Fox Actual. Alpha, we are mo-"

Sacquet: C> "MON AMI! YOU LIVE! PRAISE CELESTIA! Errr.. Alpha Fox Actual, we are pleased to hear you, mon ami!"

K: C> "Alright, everyone. Zero in on my signal. We've stepped into something again, and we need help. We've captured an Orghuzian torpedo boat, and we will be liberating it - but, we'll be sailing out without colors.."

Fluttershy: C> "Alpha Four. W-We're almost to your position, and I have an Equestrian Flag with me."

K: C> "That'll do, Four. Get here." I nodded. "We have friends coming, everyone." Then to Seaspray. "You and me go back to the Queen and hand off the Feather."

Seaspray: "You got it." He nodded.

Dusk: "When the others arrive, we'll get this thing ready to depart." He nodded.

K: "We'll be back shortly." I shrugged.

Seaspray and I departed, and made haste back to the cave. It was simple enough to avoid the Storm Guards.

Seaspray: "I hope Her Highness agrees to help in the war." He looked at the water, as he re-activated his necklace, and slid in. "You ponies.. and you, K.. you're very brave. I think with your help, we can take our home back." He nodded. "After that, we owe you."

I activated Leviathan's Amulet, and just about fell over from the EXCRUCIATING PAIN..

..yeah, whoops, forgot about that part. Very undignified, but, eh.

After panting a bit, to recover from the pain, I slid into the water with Seaspray, and we departed for the Queen's underwater palace. The trip was uneventful, and for a time, I had a school of small fish keeping pace with me for cover from larger predators.

I did smile upon seeing an octopus of unusual size, just chilling on a rock, like the whole world was of no bother to them.

We soon arrived back in the Queen's chambers.

Queen Novo: "AH! Back so soon." She nodded to me.

Seaspray: "Your Majesty, he indeed fetched the feather. Moreover, Tirek's forces had coveted it. We defeated them." He bowed his head to her.

K: "One feather, Queen Novo." I said, handing it to her in a small jar.

Queen Novo: "Indeed, you have kept your bargain." She nodded. "Unfortunately, I'm afraid the deal has changed." She nodded to Seaspray. "Seize the human."

Seapsray: "Q-Queen Novo!?" He was taken aback.

Adagio Dazzle: "DO as you QUEEN commands!"

Slithering from the darkness came three forms. I did not recognize them for what they were - Sirens - at first, as they did not resemble human legends. But, they were there. And one of them was holding Skystar by the throat.

Adagio Dazzle: "I am Adagio Dazzle." She nodded curtly to me. "Siren." And smiled. "And you will make a fine prize for Lord Tirek."

K: "Work for him, do you?" Like I didn't expect this.

Adagio Dazzle: "Not yet. YOU, however, will make a fine bargaining chip for our new underwater empire." She smirked. "After all, why should ANY OF US risk ONE DROP of OUR PRECIOUS BLOOD for you SURFACE DWELLERS." She sneered.

Behind her, Queen Novo looked absolutely sick to her stomach, though she was hiding it well. I knew she'd been coerced into making some kind of Faustian bargain with these usurpers, and the safety of her daughter meant more than anything in the world.

She was a good parent.

K: "You want me? Come take me yourself." I narrowed my eyes at her, and drew the Sword of Rainbow's Light.

Adagio Dazzle: "WHAT?!" She screeched (and that did hurt my ears).

K: "Yeah, FUCK YOU, BITCH!" I jabbed the sword, a bit, in her direction. "YOU WILL NOT ORDER THESE PEOPLE AROUND!"

Adagio Dazzle: "We.. we could simply KILL the hostage!" She sneered.

K: "They're not NEIGHTO members, yet. I have.. absolutely no responsibility to defend them." I cocked a brow, looking back to Queen Novo. "Seaspray? Would you say your Queen is no longer capable of discharging her Royal duties?" Come on, man, you've known me only a few hours, but PLEASE PLAY ALONG...

Seaspray: "..y-yes. YES!" He nodded firmly. "There are.. other members of the Royal Family, after all." He looked at the Queen. "For the protection of our people, Majesty, I must.. say this is a Military Coup." He crossed his fins. "I declare myself head of the Hippogriffian Government." And looked at Dazzle. "Congratulations. Your bargaining chip is valueless." He shrugged. "She's a life. I'm a military man. People die in war. Casualties are acceptable."

SEASPRAY, I LOVE YOU - NO HOMO! THAT WAS FLAWLESS!

Adagio Dazzle: "F-FINE!" She stammered, angered. "Aria? Release the hostage! We'll take the human ourselves!" She started to swim forwards.

Aria Blaze: "No." She released Skystar, though. "I won't. I.. I won't fight that human." She looked right at me and blushed. "You've heard what they say about him." She blushed harder. "Human?"

K: "Yeees?" I tilted my head to her, smiling.

Aria Blaze: "I will make you.. a deal." She blinked a bit. "Make me your lover, and I will turn on my sister."

K: "Done." I nodded - hey, Applejack already approved this, and besides, I'll deal with this later.

Adagio Dazzle: "YOU WOULD BETRAY ME FOR DICK!? FOR DICK?! ARE YOU THAT MUCH OF A FLUFFING SLUT?!" She suddenly turned and screamed at her.

Aria Blaze: "..for him? YES." She crossed her forehooves and stood up to her.

Sonata Dusk: "And if I have to fight Aria, I'm not going to fight, Addi." She slid up. "I won't fight my own sister." She crossed her forelegs as well.

Adagio Dazzle: "ARE YOU TWO DENSE?! ARE YOU STUPID!? IT'S THREE AGAINST ONE IF WE STICK TOGETHER!" She screeched.

Aria Blaze: "Two against one - disfavoring you - is how I read it." She nodded.

Adagio Dazzle: "No!" She turned, to try and get in a rapid strike on me, but found herself at the tip of my sword, and the tips of the tridents of several Guards, and Seaspray. "--oh."

We had snuck up behind her while she was distracted.

K: "Aria, is it?" I nodded to her. "I think Seaspray will allow your other sister-"

Sonata Dusk: "Sonata." She nodded. "Sonata Dusk."

K: "-Sonata.." I nodded. "To leave or stay as a friend, if she so chooses, and will see your other sister, Adagio, has some time in the dungeon to think over her crimes. Meanwhile, you and I have an appointment topside?" I tilted my head. "I don't spawn like a salmon, Aria." I smirked, dominantly, at her.

Aria Blaze: "A-Ah!" She blushed. "O-OF COURSE!" She said loudly, full of anxiety and anticipation.

Well.. now this is how you handle a big FISH story, huh?

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: This Day, Aria (Blaze)

TIME: 17:44 GMT
DATE: War Day 1006, 4 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: HMS Bounty, Mareterranian Sea, En route to Roam


Well. That.. was..

K: "How is she?" I said, rolling over in the small bunk, and nuzzling my wife.

Applejack: "Passed right out." She kissed me.

Aria Blaze, in the form of a Pegasus Pony, was indeed unconscious between us. And leaking fluids from various holes.

NO, YOU SICK BASTARDS! I TOLD YOU BEFORE, NO MORE DETAILS.

..you get some hints, that's all.

Dusty: "Mmmff.. keep it down, hm." She snuggled AJ from behind.

K: "If Rarity was still with us." I shrugged, and slid out of the mare pile.

My clothes had been washed out as best as possible. I put them on, now that they were mostly dry. The Camels had some food aboard, but it was all preserved stuff. Dried dates, rice, things like that. They had oats, too, and I once more reflected on how universal the consumption of Oats was on this planet.

When Golden and Fluttershy arrived, they'd had Dusty Dunes with them as well. She wasn't so used to long flights, but she COULD fly. I found out, she'd pushed herself. Mainly because of me.

Remember, that Mare doesn't trust me to come back from anything alive. And with Applejack gone, too, it had apparently taken a toll on her. She'd held it together and been professional, but her, Sunset, and Steela were ALL torn up over my vanishing act, never mind the others.

Dressed, I got up to the bridge. Broken and Rainbow McSherbet were manning the bridge.

K: "Sorry for the.. uh.. amm.." I shrugged. "..christening of the vessel?" I shrugged.

Rainbow McSherbet: "Yar-har-har, General." He smirked, and chuckled. "Ahh.. hey, your Magic Jewels got us out of a real tight spot, there. I'd be proud of that!" He beamed a grin.

Broken: "A-ah-aye.." He nodded, a bit blushy. "Jes' - ah mean, me n' Mary.. barely.. ye know.." He fumbled.

K: "You're fine." I nodded. "Look at Golden and Fluttershy?" I shrugged. "Speaking of-"

Rainbow McSherbet: "Dusk, Trixie, Golden, Fluttershy, Dash, and Gilda are below, ponying the engines." He nodded, with a small smile. "We're making 30 knots, and should be meeting the rest of the fleet in two hours."

K: "Alright. And the Equestrian fleet force?" I nodded to him.

Rainbow McSherbet: "The Sunstone Surface Battle Group and the Hermes Carrier Battle Group departed Baleston already. It'll be several days until they join us in Roam, but they will be there. Sargasso Sea is in command." He nodded.

K: "Rainbow, I don't have the authority to commission you as an officer, but I can do this - effective immediately, you are created to the rank of Senior Chief Warrant Officer." I put my hand on his shoulder. "When I get the consent of Luna, you're going to be Commissioned as a Lieutenant in the Navy, for starters. And in the naval tradition, that doesn't matter - Bounty is your ship."

Rainbow McSherbet: "Heh." He smiled broadly. "Got me own ship again.. my goodness. Now I need me a Mare." He lolled his head a bit.

K: "Hang around us, that'll happen." I nodded.

I had a feeling SOMETHING would. I just wasn't sure what, yet.


TIME: 07:11 GMT
DATE: War Day 1008, 6 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Principality of Marenaco


Yes, Marenaco, not Roam. A storm had come up in the Mareterranian Sea, and combined with a nice security threat made in the capital, we had decided to reroute to Marenaco instead, and go to Roam by train. We were escorted by the Prench and Roaman fleets the whole way.

Once we arrived, we were brought not to the palace, but to the FINEST hotel in the land. Which was also a casino.

Prince Vouz-Tire le Levier: "Ah, Zhjenaral K!" He bowed his head a little. "Welcome to my land."

K: "Prince Levier." I nodded to him in return. "Allow me to introduce my staff.." I motioned to the ones that had joined us aboard the Bounty after meeting up with the Roaman Fleet. "My wife, Applejack. My bodyguard, Steela. Dusty, Sunset, Dusk, Rarity, Trixie, Rainbow Dash, Rainbow McSherbet, Fluttershy, Golden Wattle, and Aria Blaze."

Prince Levier: "Oui! It is our pleasure. As we have zee political allegiance with Prance, consider us a home port, Zhjeneral." He motioned for us to enter the Casino portion of the hotel. "The manager of the Hotel, Colour Velour." He presented a stout, somewhat uptight, but at the same time friendly, stallion in blue coat with a dark blue main and small "Poirot" mustache.

It was true - while Marenaco was -technically- independent, it was in a Dynastic Union with Prance. Prince Levier was Princess Escargot's twin brother. As they were not married (of course), this would not be a Personal Union. As such, the terms of the Dynastic Union dictated that Marenaco engage in alliances alongside Prance.

When it came to NEIGHTO Standardization, Marenican citizens were free to join the Prench armed forces (and wore a tiny patch next to their National Flag to show they were Marenican). Marenaco had its own independent Gendarmes Battalion, however, that did function as both National Police and a self defense force.

Colour Velour: "Please. Welcome." He gestured us in. "Zee Prince has arranged a.. account for you.. to relax with, oui?"

K: "Oh, really? Chance to go gambling and all." I smirked. "Never done it."

Rarity: "G-Gambling.. y-yes.." She started sweating instantly.

Dusk: "Are you okay, honey?" He tilted his head at her, he saw it.

Rarity: "S-Slot.. m-machines.." She was starting to get sweaty.

Colour Velour: "Oui, madame. And we have Baccarat as wel-"

Rarity: "BACCARAT, you say?!" She absolutely lit up.

Dusk: "Uh.. what's going on?"

Applejack: "Ohhhh.. OH NO! Not this again!" She snorted, and walked right over to Rarity, and grabbed her tail in her mouth. "NO! Ab-sa-loot-lee, not! REMEMBER WHUT HAPPENED LAST TIME!?" She loudly corrected her.

Dusk: "K?" He looked at me, shrugging his shoulders.

K: "I.. I have no idea." I shrugged and shook my head as well.

Fluttershy: "Uhm.. before you came to Equestria, K, Rarity had.. a bit of a.. gambling probl-"

Rarity: "IT WAS NOT a PROBLEM, Darling!" She hissed at Fluttershy. "I could quit any time I wanted.. I just hadn't hit my lucky streak yet."

Applejack: "YEW GAMBLED AWAY EVER BIT Y'HAD, AN' THE BOTIQUE, AN' YER FAMILY'S PROPERTY, WHUT'CH'ALL DIDN'T HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHTS TO!" She bellowed. "That's when them.. COLLECTORS.. came 'round an' nearly busted yer knees!"

Rarity: "I-I.. just needed.. a little more TIME.. a-a little more MONEY.. I could have won it all ba-"

Applejack: "YEW AIN'T JES' ADDICTED T'GAMBLIN, Y'ALL SUCK AT IT HARDER'N DASH GOIN' AFTER THE CIDER!" She just about screamed, and I had to PULL HER BACK (I was not going to beat her in strength).

K: "Soooo.." *GRUNT!* "..honey, how did you solve that?" I didn't remember THIS being an episode!

Applejack: "Ah." She blushed. "Ah dun took't'em to th' cleaners." She rubbed the back of her neck. "I'm real good at them thur cards, I s'pose.."

Rarity: "I-Indeed, I.. that's why-"

Applejack: "NO!" She glared at her.

Fluttershy: "..she had help." She shrugged her wings. "I.. have an instinct for cards." And blushed. "I've never gone bust in a single game of Blackjack."

Golden: "Izzat so?" He tilted his head, smiling.

Fluttershy: "W-Which is why I don't like gambling.. it's too easy.." She hid behind Golden a little.

K: "Okay, then.." I nodded sharply to Dusk. "Take your wife into custody and escort her to her suite." I looked to Trixie. "Go with. Keep her busy."

Trixie shot me the horniest look.

K: "I'm well aware of what I just said." I smiled broadly.

Dusk: "You got it, K." He nodded firmly, and hefted his wife up over his shoulder.

Rarity: *SHRIEK!* "Oh, UN-HOOF me! You.. you.. barbaric raider!" She swatted his flanks (softly).

Dusk: "Yeah, I'm.. gonna be raiding, alright." He grinned mischievously.

Prince Levier: "Oh, my my!" He beamed a grin. "A very healthy marriage, oui-non?" He even ribbed me a bit.

K: "About as healthy as mine." I nodded, watching Rarity (largely pretend to) carry on as Dusk absconded with her.

Rainbow McSherbet: "Say.. do you have.. races here?" He wiggled his eyebrows.

Colour Velour: "Oui. We have zee great Pegasi Race of Marenaco - zee Grand Prix - happening tomorrow." He nodded to the prince. "His Highness asked you be afforded good seats."

Rainbow McSherbet: "You.. ah.. you take wagers on that?" He grinned a bit.

Colour Velour: "AH! OUI Monsieur!" He gestured over to the side hallway labeled for racing bets. "Here." He handed over several Casino placards of different denominations - about 50,000 Equestrian Bits worth.

Rainbow McSherbet: "Hey, K." He tugged my sleeve. "Come on." He was.. quite excited.

Applejack: "Eh, why not?" She shrugged. "Jes' keep me away fr'm 'em cards."

K: "Sure." I nodded, accepting my cache of placards. "Everyone? Shore Leave." I nodded.

Prince Levier: "OUI!" He nodded firmly. "I insist you take some time for rest, Zjehneral." He patted my shoulder. "I hear you work so very hard."

We made our way over to the sports betting windows, and I found that this included a HUGE lounge area where radio reports of different events could be listened to.

Rainbow McSherbet, like an expert, went right to the racing forms, and biographies of the racers. He was a quick study, examining and discarding various racers as he looked over their materials. Finally, he selected one.

Rainbow McSherbet: "This one. Sky Stinger." He held up his race card.

Rainbow Dash: "Hey, I know who that is!" She snorted. "I wonder what they're doing racing?" She shrugged.

K: "Who are they?" I nodded to her.

Rainbow Dash: "I met them a while ago. They worked in the Weather Crew. He wanted to be in the Wonderbolts, but.." She shrugged and shook her head. "He's a bit younger than me - he always hung around with this other guy, Timber."

Sunset, Sacquet, Julienne, and La Boche (who I was SHOCKED was wearing an Officer's uniform), Cody, and some others came up about then.

K: "Philippe." I nodded to him. "Where's Gorton?" I shrugged.

Julienne: "GENERAL.. Gorton." She beamed a grin. "Ze new king, Gorcat, asked him to come and be the commander of the Griffon armies." She shrugged.

Sacquet: "So, I promote La Boche to Lieutenant." He nodded. "Gasconade is now Sergeant Major. And Zoroloa's cousin is our new Legionnaire." He nodded. "BUT! Mon ami!" He hugged me... genuinely, not formally, and very tightly. "I am so glad to see you alive."

K: "And likewise." I hugged back. "This is Rainbow McSherbet." I gestured to him.

Sacquet: "Oui. I am General Philippe Sacquet." He shook hooves. "General K and I have been friends for a long time."

Julienne: "Oui. Once, a mare fancied him, but he was a good friend and directed her into the hooves of another." She showed off her engagement band.

La Boche: "And I? Am pleased to be an officer raised through zee ranks." He shook hoof-and-hand with me. "You were the reason, mon ami." He nodded to me.

K: "You're not Society in any way, are you?" I shrugged.

La Boche: "I am.. as you say.. fallen from graces. My father, before ze war, was Professor, but was disgraced for coming up with zees theory regarding zee magics of Friendship." He shrugged a bit. "So, he was cast down from Society, and became a shop keeper. Not even zee owner."

K: "Hm." I wagged a finger at him. "I'm going to want to learn about that theory, it might help." I nodded.

La Boche: "Oui?" He nodded.

We were all following Rainbow Dash and McSherbet to the area where the racers were preparing.

Whom we met there.. was unusual.

Timber Spruce: "I think you'll be fine, Sky." He was helping him stretch.

Sky Stinger: "Thanks, Timb." He was just getting done with his post-workout massage - it was clear that Timber had worked out with him.

Rainbow Shine: "I-I know you will. We've worked so hard at this." She was fussing over him.

The room looked like a cross between a gym and a car garage. It made sense. The Marenaco Grand Prix was a replacement for the Earth Monaco Grand Prix, and as they didn't have vehicles until RECENTLY.. the races would be done by Pegasi.

What got me was Sunset's reaction to the crew. Specifically, Timber Spruce.

Sunset: "OH! H-Hello.." She gazed at Timber the same way she once gazed at me.

Oh, really, now? Huh. I grinned.

Timber Spruce: "Hm?" He turned to look at her, and I could tell, immediately was struck. He blushed. "Ah-hi. I'm Timber. Timber Spruce." He realized I was there, cleared his throat, looked back from Sunset to me, and continued. "This is Sky Stinger and Rainbow Shine."

K: "I'm K." I nodded to Sky Stinger. "General K." I gestured to the others. "My friends." I nodded to Rainbow Shine. "I know Shiny already."

Rainbow McSherbet: "Hmmmmmm." He paced over to Sky Stinger, and nodded. "Yeah, he's going to win." He nodded with a smile.

Timber Spruce: "Excuse me?" He tilted his head at Rainbow McSherbet.

Rainbow McSherbet: "Yep. And? Call me Sherby." He nodded to all of us. "My nickname. Rainbow McSherbet is the full name."

Rainbow Shine: "G-General K.." She blushed hard. "It's been forever."

K: "Sure has, Rainbow Shine." I pet her head.

She melted.

Applejack: "Y'all know he's married, right?" She cocked a brow at her.

Rainbow Shine: "S-Sorry, Applejack.. just.. YOU know.. ever since the party.. all those years ago." She was fawning over me.

Everyone was blushing a bit - Sunset was staring at Timber like he was a piece of meat. Timber was blushing at the attention from an ALICORN of all things. Rainbow Shine was practically MELTING at my attention. Applejack was thinking.. evil things.

Applejack: "..when's th' race?" She asked, flatly.

Timber Spruce: "Tomorrow." He nodded.

Applejack just.. smirked. She had PLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAANSSS.. I could see the devious look in her eye.

I was in so much trouble.

Part 4: Racing Raced Races

TIME: 05:22 Central European Time
DATE: War Day 1009, 7 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Royal Hotel and Casino, Principality of Marenaco


It was the day of the Marenaco Grand Prix. Very early in the morning. I slid out of bed. My "Harem" had a guest in the form of a very exhausted, very hole-pounded Rainbow Shine, but was one Mare lighter.

Sunset.

I smiled, as I went into the connected next bedroom. She was asleep alone, but there was a reason. The previous evening, she had been forward enough to ask Spruce on a date (this was entirely AJ's doing, as I would discover). It ended well. Very well. She had been intoxicated. So had he. Spruce brought her to our suite, and put her to bed, making sure her snootle was turned away from her, with her on her side, facing a trash can.

He had experience with drunkenness, and it showed.

Timber Spruce, on the other hand, was asleep on the couch in this room. Keeping in mind, this couch was the width of a Pony twin bed, and twice as comfortable.

This ABSOLUTE GOOD LAD.. had the good sense to sleep apart from her.

I looked at the OTHER bed in this room, and Aria Blaze and Sky Stinger were also asleep.. THEY had fallen asleep in the Pony MATING PRESS position, with Sky Stinger DEEP inside her, and her on all fours.

THAT had shocked me.

So, now, my "harem" was reduced to AJ, Dusty, Steela, and Luna. This suited me well.

I was staring at the strangely-positioned duo, as I sat at the VERY end of the couch to get my boots on - I didn't think I'd alert Spruce, but I did.

He sat bolt upright (this bothered me).

Timber Spruce: *Quietly* "Sorry, General." He said, addressing me as though 'General' was my name, not my rank.

K: "Just K, my dude." I nodded to him. "Sorry to wake you."

Timber Spruce: "Yeah.. ah.. old reflexes die hard." He rubbed the back of his neck.

K: "..drunk mom?" I put the pieces together.

Timber Spruce: "Ah.. yeah.." He shrugged, blinking, and looking downwards.

I slid over and put an arm around him. Even in Pony society, Bros don't HUG-hug unless they know each other better. Still, I wanted him to know I cared.

Timber Spruce: "Th-thanks. You get it..?" He looked up at me, sheepishly.

K: "My mother got piss-her-pants drunk a lot, before she was forced into Rehab." I shrugged.

Again, TRUE FACTS folks. My mother came home drunk from the bar with her pants pissed, and her unaware of it, several times. Worse, my teachers told me it was no big deal (they gaslit me). No one helped for a long time, until a Social Worker did, and forced my mother into Rehab under the threat of arrest for child neglect. She complied, GOT SOBER, and never drank again. Good ending (more or less).

Still, I understood where Timber was coming from.

Timber Spruce: "Y-Yeah." He leaned into me a bit. "Thanks."

K: "..you like Sunset?" I nodded to her passed-out self.

Timber Spruce: "..a lot." He blushed. "But I.. it's just been one date. I mean. I don't know how to show her I want it to be more."

K: "Easy. Tell her you had fun. Ask her to go out with you." I nodded.

Timber Spruce: "But, she's.. an Alicorn.. and.." He sighed, wistfully. "There's a war on and all."

K: "We'll be here for better than a week, with the security issues that're happening in Roam." I shrugged. "You have a shot. Take it." I nodded slowly.

We both heard the groaning from the other side of the room, and looked over to see an unconscious Sky Stinger and an equally unconscious Aria Blaze, very slowly, bucking hips again. I had to bite my lip to keep from laughing. Timber looked like he was about to burst with laughter.

Timber Spruce: "We.. we should wake him up." He grinned.

K: "Yeap." I nodded, grinning like a loon. "I got this."

I stood up, once my boots were secured, and went over to Aria and Sky. I leaned down into Aria's ear and whispered something to her that I won't repeat.

Aria: "OH HORSEFEATHERS!" She jolted awake, and-

Sky Stinger: "YIKE!" He did, too, and-

Both of them fell out of bed on opposite sides.

Timber Spruce: "Come on, Sky, my colt! We gotta get ready for the race!" He encouraged.

K: "Good morning, Aria." I said, with her at my feet, curled up, tail tucked to cover her parts (despite the puddle quickly oozing out), and blushing at me.

Aria: "REALLY, human!?" She flushed harder.

K: "I've done it before." I shrugged.

Aria: "You.. you KNOW.." She blushed absolutely maroon. "..that's kinda why I betrayed them." She rolled over on her hooves, and VERY quickly scurried to the bathroom. "NOW I NEED A SHOWER!"

Sky Stinger: "Hey, babe! Wait for me, I'll join you!" He scurried after her.

Aria: "ARE YOU KIDDING!? I think you've 'JOINED' me enough for one day!" She called, as she shut the door in his face.

Timber and I fell on our butts laughing at the display.

Sunset: "Ahahahaa!" She laughed, sitting up in bed. "OH! That was hilarious."

Applejack: "Mm.." She was at the door to our room. "Quah't the display, Honeybun." She smirked, and trotted over to me, rubbing her head on my hip.

K: "No kidding." I nodded.

Applejack and I slid into the main room of our very large suite. As we made our way over to the breakfast rolling carts that had been brought in, she nuzzled me again.

Applejack: "Ah c'n see it now. Sunset's goin' fer that Spruce feller. An' Aria's gonna end up with Sky Stinger." She grinned a little. "Means we'll have'ta bring'em with, ya know." She said, going over and pouring some Prench Roast coffee from the decanter.

K: "It does." I accepted the cup from my wife, leaning in for a kiss. "It's nice." I shrugged a bit. "Our friends finding people to love."

Applejack: "Yeah-huh." She set about arranging a plate for breakfast for us to share.. we'd be fork-feeding each other.

The others started coming out of the rooms. Our "Royal Suite" had four actual SETS of bedrooms (each set was 2 or 3 bedrooms for a total of 10) and one large central area, plus the "royal bed chamber" at the back. It was designed for visiting royals with large entourages.

I wasn't a royal, but I had an entourage. The amusing sight of Dusk practically CRAWLING out of his room and over to the coffee made both me and AJ giggle.

Dusk: "Oh, really?!" He smirked at us. "And what did YOU do last night?!" He leaned in at me, while using his telekinesis magic to pour coffee.

K: "Rainbow Shine." I nodded, cocking a brow. "And I had AJ, Dusty, and Steela in there as well." I shrugged.

Dusk: "Still." He nodded.

K: "We have our fun." I shrugged at him.

Rarity practically OOZED out of the bedroom, carrying herself like a Cheshire cat. Smug. Happy. SATISFIED. She trotted over to the breakfast carts as the others started grabbing coffee and tea. She said nothing, but gave AJ a wink.

Trixie finally came out after showering, and she looked PLOWED. Like, last night wore her out, and the sleep did little to rest her. She trudged over to the coffee and just.. started drinking straight from the decanter. We snickered and chuckled.

Timber: "After breakfast, we need to get down to the Studio and get ready for the race." He nodded.

K: "I'm.. not a racer." I gestured to him and Sky. "Tell me about this." I nodded to Sherby.

Sky Stinger: "Racing around here.. anyone can do it. It's just.. to make a living, you gotta be GOOD. Any race with a purse worth anything, is invite only. The bigger the race, the more exclusive the invite. Marenaco is the BIGGEST." He shrugged his wings, and picked his meal carefully.

Timber: "It's important. Marenaco isn't just the toughest race in the International Pegasus Race Federation, it has the second biggest Purse for the winner." He nodded. "Only the Paris Grand Prix has a larger purse - and you can't get an invite to that unless you win at least two Marenaco Grand Prix in a row, or three in five years." He shook his head. "Pegasi racing is tough. The average Pegasi is good for maybe 20 to 25 seasons of racing."

Rainbow Dash: "..yeah, ah.. once we pass about 40, we just don't have it any more." She shrugged her wings. "Speed, that is. Most Pegasi peak between 16 and 26." She blinked a bit. "I mean.." She suddenly looked a bit nervous.

Gilda: "Don't you EVEN." She came over and kissed her wife. "You're the fastest Pegasus ever. You won't hit the wall until you're at least 35." She smirked.

Rainbow Dash: "YEAH!" She gave an invigorated look.

Dusty: "It's true, though. Most Pegasi over 40 or 45 just don't have the speed, any more. There's a few exceptions. Like Heart Hilldale." She shrugged her wings. "He was one of the best. He died in a crash about a year before you showed up, K." She frowned a bit.

Timber: "That's another risk. Pegasi generally fly so fast in these races, at close to ground level, that sometimes.. sometimes they slam into things. Buildings. Trees. Ponies." He shrugged a bit, and took a bite of toast as Rainbow Shine STAGGERED out from the bedrooms, looking positively WRECKED.

ALL of my former lovers in the room nodded with approval. AJ struck a haughty pose, grinning madly.

Rainbow Shine: "Ugh.." *Groan* "..that's why Sky getting an invite to Marenaco was so big. Another racer, Airton Sienna, crashed badly at San Mareino a couple months ago." She blinked and looked down. "He died, too. Sky was in the seed to take his place and got drawn at random for an invite. Out of 24 other Seeded racers." She shrugged, and went for the coffee.

K: "My question is.. why?" I looked at the three of them. "I'm a bit familiar with racing from my world - we used vehicles. Generally, teams have sponsors. I don't see any, here."

They, all three, looked at each other and lowered their heads.

Timber: "It's all because of me." He grew quiet.

Sunset: "Secrets kill, Timber." She slid up next to him, and put her wing over his shoulder. "Look, I like you. I want to see if last night was just a night or something more." Timber blushed electric red. "But I don't want to start a relationship based on lies or secrets."

Timber: "Ah." He considered himself for a good couple of minutes, and nodded. "My sister, Glory, and I. We run a camp in Equestria. In Coltorado. It's for.." He grew sheepish. "..mainly foals that don't have a lot. Lost a parent, poor, whatever it is. It's a chance for them to have fun for a summer." He grunted a bit. "We had several big sponsors, at first, but.. most of them.." He looked at Sky. "A lot of them stopped helping us because of his dad."

Sky Stinger: "Yeah. My dad wants the land. He kinda scared off a lot of the sponsors." He shrugged his wings. "I.. my dad and I don't get along any more, because of that. So, that's why we started racing. We picked up gear and whatever else we could, from stuff other teams threw out or gave to us. Training equipment, gym time, transportation, we did it all ourselves."

Rainbow Shine: "That's.. why we need to win this race, K." She looked up at me, doe-eyed.

K: "Well, Sherby says you can do it." I nodded.

Rainbow McSherbet: "YEAH!" He nodded, enthusiastically. "I know he's going to win."

Well, they certainly had their reasons. Now, it was just a matter of doing it. Given that Sunset had basically fallen for Timber, I felt I needed to see this through.

I had no idea what we were in store for.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Places and Peoples

TIME: 07:44 Central European Time
DATE: War Day 1009, 7 Primaus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Marenaco Grand Prix Racegrounds, Principality of Marenaco

We were at the studio (think of it like a Garage, if you're into NASCAR or F1 or something) for Sky Stinger. It was, indeed, very plain compared to the equipment I saw stacked up at other Studios for other racers. Things like electronic wing beat sensors to optimize wing beats per second, to massage equipment, to "chilling stations." They took this VERY seriously.

Sky was getting warmed up after a carefully selected breakfast. Balanced nutrition for energy and endurance. This actually meant some meat in there, along with animal fat - he had eaten a pork steak with breakfast. He was slowly "revving" his wings, up, then down. Coming to speed, then slowly backing off.

Timber: "You're looking good." He nodded.

Aria: "He BETTER." She gave him a very Yandere look. "I don't let losers 'join' me." And smirked.

That.. made him blush a bit.

K: "So, Timber, you're from Equestria and all. Sky, you, too." I nodded to them. "You done military training?"

Timber: "Ah, yeah. I'm in the Coltorado Springs Militia's Ranger Platoon." He shrugged slightly.

Sky Stinger: "Air Force. After the race, I'm supposed to do pilot training." He nodded. "Finished Basic Training, though."

Rainbow Shine: "And K knows, I'm in the Ponyville Militia." She looked at the others in my crew not from Ponyville. "I was there for both battles of Ponyville and a few other ops." She shrugged. "I'm Ranger Qualified, but I moved to take Written Script's post as Militia Quartermaster." She nodded to me with a beaming grin. "You know him and Goldie are expecting?! Scoots is so excited to get a sibling!"

K: "That's great!" I beamed a grin.

Norfy: "She's pretty good." He came pacing in with Gaze, Cosmic, Forest Spirit, and Redheart. "Heya. Norfy."

Gaze: "Gaze." He nodded to them.

Cosmic: "Cosmic Plane." He adjusted his glasses.

Forest Spirit: "Forest Spirit - and my wife, Redheart." She smiled, next to him. "Good to see you, Rainbow Shine." He gave her a high-hoof.

Rainbow Shine: "Commandant!" She leaned into that, then giggled. "I remember when you were just a Captain!"

Redheart: "I remember before K had a rank!" She nudged me. "He used to come to the hospital and just help out. Sometimes, he read stories to the foals." She looked thoughtful for a moment. "A lot's happened since then.."

K: "Yeah. And I hope to go back to that, soon." I nodded firmly. "Race starts in a few minutes - let's all get to our seats and leave the Race Team to their thing." I nodded to them.

My group found their way to the stands. This being pre-Television, they had a magical solution. Gigantic broadcast crystals and a small army of Unicorns to power them. A huge one was set up for our area of the stands. Along the route, other crystals - acting much like live cameras, powered by Unicorn magic - would send signals to the large display crystals at the stands. One especially powerful Unicorn - acting as Director - sequenced which display crystals got which signals.

It struck me how much they could replicate modern technology, with magic, if they put their minds to it. It was a fascinating study in what made the world work. After a bit, we got to our seats.

Announcer: "Bonjour, messieurs et mesdames. C'est l'heure du Grand Prix de Marenaco!" There was a pause. "Sirs and madames! It is time for the Marenaco Grand Prix! The racers will now line up!"

I saw all of them get into the starting brackets, painted boxes on a concrete slab that marked the starting point of the race. Some of the race path was 'paved street' in the sense that it had slab concrete roads (of Roaman concrete), while other parts were dirt, or cobblestone. The rules were simple - get from the start to the finish. Pegasi were allowed to run along the ground briefly for safety reasons, but could not spend more than a few seconds running.

Sky was starting near the back-middle of the pack. Since he was randomly seeded, and not a top competitor, he was randomly placed in the "back 15." The top ten contenders were in the front, with the odds-on favorite having Pole Position.

PA: "UN.. DEUX.. TROIS!" *Popgun sound*

And off they went! They broke through the first section in an orderly fashion, and as soon as the roadway opened up, there was an immediate move by several racers to improve their position. Sky was in the upper middle somewhere. I could see him. Smart - he was letting the early race chaos play in his favor.

The racers were all amazing athletes. I could tell, though, some of them were very egotistical. The odds-on favorite, Brilliant Flash from Ambleon, was ahead by several lengths, and showing off just a bit.

Rainbow Dash: "..maaaaan, these guys are all so slow." She snorted, looking through binoculars, and occasionally, the big screen.

Gilda: "Not all of them are as awesome as you, honey." She slid her arm over her wife's shoulder.

K: "No kidding." I nodded. "It's still fun to watch, though." I smirked.

Applejack: "Sky's doin' good - bein' conservative in th' early game, lett'n others tucker'em'sevles out." She smirked.

Rainbow McSherbet: "Brilliant Flash will make a mistake about three quarters of the way through. That's his chance to overtake." He nodded, suddenly serious and strategic. "See there? He's already moving up the pack - he's breached the Top Tens."

Sure enough, a check of the screen showed he was in 8th place at the moment. Racers in 6th to 3rd place were bunched together. Second place was a bit ahead. Brilliant Flash, in first, was way out ahead.

Sky bided his time well. As they approached the next turn, the four racers ahead of him that were bunched together, clustered badly on the inside, causing the 4th place racer to crash into a pile of hay bales. Meanwhile, Sky slipped past them on the outside, executing an in-line twist into a canopy roll.

That's when it happened. As the crash team got over to where the 4th place racer crashed..

Cosmic: "HEY! What's THAT?!" He pointed to the hay bales.

A giant trunk of a vine shot up from the ground. The 4th place racer was completely cocooned in the vines. They lashed out, grabbing one of the crash team, and cocooning them as well. Once the vine was further out of the ground, the former racer was ejected from the cocoon at high velocity, her corpse rolling to the ground.. then getting up.

Taken over by vines, with one growing out of her right eye socket, she shambled forwards.

There was a pause.

I bolted for the announcer's cabin, getting to the PA system, with Julienne right behind me, and half the team trailing me.

K: PA> "ATTENTION! ATTENTION! WE ARE UNDER ATTACK! CIVILIANS, PLEASE FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OF NEIGHTO OFFICERS TO ESCAPE THE AREA! RACERS, STOP THE RACE! GET TO COVER! ALL MARENACIAN GENDARMES THAT CAN HEAR THIS BROADCAST, ASSEMBLE AT THE RACE STAGING AREA - CODE TEAL!"

Julienne took the mic from me, and repeated these instructions in Prench. Everyone was checking their weapons and gear.

This had to be Tirek, I figured - another assassination attempt.

I would find out, tragically, I was very wrong.
