"Fashionably Late"




It was another lonely night. Another lonely night for a lonely mare. Her coat the finest white, her mane and tail still a vibrant darker blue hue.. very faintly lighter than it was 12 years ago when the current Princess of Friendship first arrived in Ponyville.

She sat at the bar itself, staring at her wine glass. It was.. a good wine.. she just didn't have the heart to drink it. The glass was sipped on, some, and about one quarter drained from the point it had been filled.

She didn't even have the strength to get drunk, any more.

Her red dress and heels.. they turned heads when she first wore them here to Coxsaddle's "Brown Derby" Jazz Club about a year and a half ago. Now? She was a regular.

She realized this and snorted wistfully, bitterly, to herself as Melody Keys and her Jazz Band tuned up.. and started playing a familiar tune that had no words.

Tonight, it did, as she slunk over to the stage, in front of perhaps.. fewer than two dozen ponies. The white coated one simply nodded to Keys to keep playing as she leaned against her piano.

Tonight, her pain would come out, and put words to this wordless tune, making it more Blues than straight Jazz.

("Bar Jazz" - BGM, 2024)

"I'm sitting in a Jazz Bar.
Life has taken me this far,
is this the end of the lonely road for the fashionista, Rarity?

Monotony just carries me
through the day-to-day activities..

Adventure's gone, life carries on,
I live my dreams so miserably..

I'm sitting on my lonesome..
Ponies go, and ponies come,
but nothing lasts,
a fleeting past, I've given up on finding THE ONE.

I have it all,
I'm standing tall,
with vapid popularity.

They carry on,
with friendships gone,
good times now a rarity.."

She stayed up there as the song played, gently swaying with the beat. The song ended, and Rarity, stepping off from the piano, initially went back to her table, and then.. just grabbed her handbag and walked out.


Off to the side, however, two familiar mares had been watching. The two mares had heard the song, and both had been touched by her words. They realized something - that perhaps they needed to act. Though, the pinker one perked up a bit, an idea forming in her head.

"We should.. I dunno.. do something for her." The periwinkle unicorn mare frowned, looking at Rarity as she slunk off, noticing she hadn't even finished her wine.

"Just you wait." The pinker one nodded. "I have something planned."

"Really?" Her companion looked at her. "YOU? What're you going to do, cast a spell on her so she's always happy?"

"Mmm... SOMETHING like that.." The devious unicorn mare beamed a grin.


As she paced home from the jazz bar, Rarity reflected ruefully on her life. Eventful! For certain. Especially the years she spent with Princess Twilight.. years she treasured and memories she hoarded jealously. Even the time she spent two days in a desert with Pinkie Pie...

It has been a couple of years since those adventures had ended. Rarity had more or less retired to private life. While the elegant lady of Ponyville society had kept up with fasion trends, and occasionally designed for close friends, family, and others, she had largely retreated from the public sphere.

Fame will do that.

She wanted to live the rest of her life in peace, given that her friends had largely moved on. Rainbow Dash and Applejack were married, and had fostered a couple of foals. Pinkie Pie was dating someone. Twilight Sparkle was busy running the country. Fluttershy was working to 'reform' Discord, while balancing her suddenly-found love and family with a pony named Ironoak Evertree.

Starlight and Trixie were.. doing whatever they wanted. She didn't really keep up with them, so much. They weren't her core friends.

Even her little sister was dating, now, and the stallion she picked.. while not what Rarity would call a fine Gentleman.. took good care of her.

She climbed the stairs to her bedroom, thinking about all of this. She brushed out her hair, sitting at her vanity mirror, looking herself in the face. And being disappointed in what she saw. She slipped out of her little red dress - something she should.. she PROMISED herself, she'd only wear when she was happy.. and slipped into bed more like a rock than a proper lady, still thinking to herself.

Really, it was long past time the fashion mare allowed herself to slowly fade into the background. Pleased that her closest companions were happy, and trying to make that a mental accomplishment in her life. Trying to make that, and her past fame as a designer.. enough.

It wasn't. She knew damned well it wasn't. But, she couldn't be bitter about it, oh no, no, no. No, that would be unbecoming. So what if she never had a family of her own? Her own mate? Her own slice of happiness?

It's not like one would magically drop itself into her new Botique in Coxsaddle..

"WHAAAAAAAAAA!"

And a loud crunch of furniture being cracked, it would rouse her from her slumber, and send her darting down stairs with a hefty pair of textile shears levitated by her horn magic. Whoever did THAT, was going to get a flank full of steel! She might be cresting 36, now, but she was by no means an old nag, yet!

"WHO DARES BREAK IN TO MY BOTIQUE!?" She bellowed, charging down the stairs, and seeing her main designing area in shambles in a cloud of dust, she shrieks. "MY FABRICS! Oh, you better be really sorr-"

She stopped, seeing who - or what - was in the middle of it all. It was on two legs, had strange forelimbs with digits on them like a Griffon, but made of flesh, and was currently trying to fix a broken stuffed horse mannequin (ponyquin?) she'd used often to lay out fabric designs on.

He stood, suddenly, and held his hands up.

"Relax! Relax! I have no idea how I got here!" And wagged them defensively in front of him.

She looked at him, a bit surprised. She tilted her head, looking at this ungainly form clad in a grey suit with a red tie, and walked up to him. Her inner Fashion Designer was overriding her good sense.

"Goodness, Darling.. what is this?" She tugged dissaprovingly at the poly-cotton blend of his jacket.

"My sport coat. Being a Corporate Drone, I have to wear this as a sort of uniform." He shrugged.

"Ah.. where are my manners? I'm Rarity." She bowed her head to him a little, seeing he was no threat, then quickly levitated the shears behind her with a slightly sheepish grin, slightly raising one foreleg.

He took her hoof in his hand.

"Anon. Anon Y Mous, dear pony. And if there's nothing like me around here? I'm a human. It's nice to meet you." He bowed his head a bit. "Is it still socially acceptable, here, to kiss a lady's hoof?"

Really, she didn't know it, but Anon was just really good at reading an audience, and at THIS moment, was trying not to get stabbed!

"Ah-bu-huh.." She was flustered immediately. "..I mean.." She blushed, but gently extended her foreleg a bit more.

He DID IT!

"My lady." A short nod, and he stood up.

Her heart immediately went to her throat. It took her several moments to regain her composure.

"Ah.. eh.." *Ahem* "So, you've no idea..?" She looked around, and a quick magical scan showed evidence of some kind of powerful spell focused on her ceiling, but the spell had long dissepated.

And, to be plain, she wasn't nearly as powerful as Twilight. She could detect that it was there, not what it was.

"None. One minute, I was trying to get a cup of water from the cooler, the next minute, I was falling through swirling purple." He shrugged. "Then, I landed on things." He gestured to the things around the botique. "I'm sorry, it seems like I broke some of them." A wide shrug. "Give me a chance to make it up to you, huh? Try and fix this?" He gestured.

Rarity, for her sake, smiled.. blushed, really. He may be alien, but he was a gentleman.


She had no idea, but there WAS a certain "reformed villain" outside, smiling to herself.

"He's hideous.. but the spell doesn't lie." She smirked.

"And you dragged me out here.. why, honey?" The periwinkle mare with the pale hair asked, quietly.

"Mm.. to see what I did. I mean, I really am trying, here." She frowned. "I've been trying for a dozen years to really, really be good.. and.." She nodded to Rarity through the window. "..Rarity being alone, for some reason, after that song... didn't sit right with me."

"You're developing a conscience." The other mare smirked.

"Ehh.. stupid conscience." She frowned. "Whatever. I found her love. She's got to do the rest from here." She shrugged. "Come on, before someone sees us."


Back inside, Rarity and Anon were cleaning up the things he'd broken on his fall down.

"I really am sorry." He sighed.

"Nonsense, it wasn't your fault." Rarity nodded. "Would you like some tea?" She smiled a bit. "It's been a long time since I entertained."

"Sure!" He smiled. "I love tea. What kind ya got?"

"Ohh.. I have some lovely Red Leaf from the Crystal Kingdom. A.. a present from an old friend." She smiled, looking down, and realizing that she'd gotten the tea for her birthday, from Cadence, two whole years ago, and never opened it.

She took just a moment, here, to realize how alone she really was.

But, then she went and made the tea.

"I can fix the mannequin." She said, getting the kettle on to the stove. "No problem. It's just the lower stand. I've got a spare." She smiled a bit, thinking about Mac crafting that spare stand for her.

"Sounds okay, I guess. I still feel bad." He said. "I guess this beats office work." He shrugged.

"Office work..?" She asked.

"Yeah.. yeah. I make spread sheets, organize numbers, and stare at a computer screen all day." He looked around. "I.. don't think you've invented those, yet."

"Computer? No, I've never heard of those." She said, getting some tea biscuits.

"To be honest, I've always wanted to make stuff. I used to design things when I had free time. But, they fired one of the guys on my team, and the rest of us had to pick up the slack. So, I've been working six days a week. No overtime." He sighed a bit, and when Rarity came back in, he was examining one of her casual designs.

"I can't think of what to add to that, to make it just.. pop." She nodded, and set the tea down.

The human gave her a glance, and moved over to some of her material bolts, and unwound some dark purple fabric. Taking up another pair of shears, he cut it to length, draped it over the pony mannequin, and draped it in an offset angle, securing it with a hand-tied button bow, that he loosely stitched together.

On the darkish red dress with gold appointment, it did indeed add that dash of complimentary contrast.

"Yes..! YEEES!" She scooted over, and helped him - with telekinesis - fix up the waist sash ribbon into a proper fit.

She didn't realize it, but they went about accessorizing the dress as well, wordlessly moving across the dress and adding just the right touches, together, feeling that vibe of creativity, and on the same wavelength.

About an hour later..

"Oh.. that was amazing, Darling." She smiled. "OH! The tea! It must be cold by now. I'm terribly sorry!"

"No, no, it's fine. It's been a long time since I've gotten to create something from.. just imagination." He shrugged, sat, and drank the tea, black and unsweetened. "Tastes really good."

"Ah.. thank you, Darling. Do you usually take milk and sugar?" She sat next to him.

"When it's hot, yeah. Or lemon and honey, depending on the tea." He nodded to her.

"Tell me, Darling.." She looked down at the cup. "..did you have a human.. uhm.. marefriend? Back in your world?"

"HAH!" He chortled. "Me?! Nahhh.. I don't make a ton of money, I'm not incredibly tall, I'm not the most handsome human in the world, and I don't drive a very expensive car." He shrugged. "Basically, I have zero qualities that human females desire that are symbols of wealth. Keeping in mind, that most females my age, aren't really looking for long term relationships. They just want a man to sleep with, and give them money, so they can do whatever they want." He shrugged, gestured, and finished his cup. "This is really good! I've never had Tea this flavor before."

"That makes two of us." She shrugged a bit.. then paused, realizing what she said. "I-I mean.. about the tea." She cleared her throat bit. "I've had.. some romances before.." She trailed off.

"I get it. You have high standards." He nodded to her. "No one really ..measured up." He smirked, and wiggled his eyebrows.

"Oh? Oh! Oh! Hahaha.." She smiled. "That pun was terrible.." She blushed a bit. "..but, thank you. It's been a while since I've had such good company."

"Same." He nodded. "Actually, this is the first time I've been to a lady's house.. in.. five years?" He shrugged. "My former co-worker, we played cards with some of the others. Two of them got fired, one got arrested for drug stuff." He gestured. "Kinda put an end to that."

"How horrible! Haven't you any social life at all, darling?" She blinked. "No friends?"

"Not really. I used to hang out with some guys from work, but, none of them are still working there." He sighed. "Actually, I.. don't have any friends, come to think of it."

"A shame." She nodded a bit. "It seems no one will miss you, there."

"Not really? I have, like, a cousin I see once every few years. Parents are long gone, no siblings." He shrugged. "You?"

"Oh.. I.. have five very dear friends, but we've not met up much in the last few years. Drifted apart, really, come to think of it. I have a darling little sister who's.. dating.. someone that takes.. good care of her." She shrugged a bit.

"But, you don't approve..?" He led in.

"No.. no, I think she could do better." She nodded firmly.

"And what about you? You've said you've had some romances." He shrugged a bit, with a small grin. "Have I got any competition?" And the smile grew to a smirk.

"Oh, my!" She blushed, and brought her right hoof to her chest. "So forward!" And wiggled her brow a bit. "No, darling. I'm afraid my paddock is empty."

"It shouldn't be." He said, plainly, looking her right in the eye.

"I.." She blushed again. "..thank you."

"So.." He looked around at the botique. "..seems I need a career change! Mind if I apply for a job, here? Gotta earn a living somehow." He shrugged.

"I'd say your application was already approved, darling." She nodded to the dress they'd worked on together. "It's about time I started getting back into fashion, myself." She said with a smile in her voice. "Now that I have a partner."

"Oh? From fabric grabber to partner in just a few minutes?" He smirked at her.

"Indeed, darling. I have so many half ideas, these days.. I suppose I needed some.. inspiration." She smiled, sweetly.

"Just getting smothered by the corporate life was enough to kill my inspiration. Working six days? Five days, nine hours, and four on the sixth day. Just barely under the legal limit requiring over time pay. And yelling at us when we can't get enough done. Man, I just felt suffocated." He shrugged.

"That sounds horrible, darling!" She nodded a bit, genuinely concerned. "I can see the stress in your face, too. What YOU need is a good night's rest, and a proper breakfast in the morning. A good walk will help you, too. You need to discharge all of that horrible stress, Darling, or you're just going to wither away from it!" She rose, and beckoned him to follow. "Come. I've a spare room with a nice, big, fluffy bed.. soft sheets, and the breeze tonight is nice and comfortable. You should sleep quite soundly!"

"I.. uh.. that.. that does sound good." He got up and shrugged. "It's better than sleeping on a futon."

"No more futons for you, darling." She said with an edge of annoyed caring. "A proper bed, and a proper set of sheets and pillows."

"Thank you, Rarity." He smiled a bit. "It's been a long time since anyone did anything like this for me."

"It's been a while since this lady has had a reason." She smiled, her tone soft.

That night, Anon slept better than he had in years. Better sleep and more restful sleep than he'd had since his old apartment burnt to a crisp 4 years ago, thanks to shoddy wiring and barely-legal fire safety equipment.

When he got up, stretched, and looked out the window.. he realized that the sun shone more brightly, here. The air from the open window was cleaner, more vibrant, and felt better in his lungs. He smiled.. genuinely smiled.. for the first time in ages.

Rarity had breakfast already ready for him, too. When he came out after stretching and washing his face, he found she'd made food, and was serving it.

"Hey..!" He smiled. "This looks pretty good."

"Well, Darling, it looked to me like your diet would be closer to a Griffon's, so, I went and got some ham. Add some eggs, and toast, and tea.. and you have a lovely breakfast." She smiled warmly.

"I.. I'll be honest.." He shrugged. "I haven't had a decent breakfast in a while. Usually, I just grab a frozen waffle and stick it in the toaster." He sat, though.

"Well. You can't design fashion on an empty stomach." She nodded firmly, eyes shut.

"Thanks." He grinned, blushing a little.

As they ate, Anon started to think about designs he'd always wanted to see brought to life. He was no fashion man, but he had thoughts. Interesting ideas that blended tradition with daring. And he was eager to share them.

Rarity, for her part, was internally buzzing like a hamster on a sugar rush. She had a fine gentleman in her house, he was kind, he was inventive.. so what if he was two legged? He seemed to have at least some feelings for her.

The society girl in her, however, was trying to pull back the reins as hard as it could - no, no, no, imagining being with him is not proper. Let him make the first moves and all of that.

It didn't help that there was a regional fashion show in two weeks, and while she had been invited to display something, she hadn't responded.

"..Anon.." She started, sipping her tea.

"Yeah?" He looked up, swallowing some ham steak.

"I've been invited to present something at the Warana Regional Fashion Show.." She started. "..and I've not responded." She looked to him. "I would.. like to see if we can design something that can absolutely.." She leaned in. "..WOW them." And wiggled her eyebrows.

"Sure!" He beamed a grin. "I'd LOVE to take up a challenge like that. Sure beats trying to fill out spreadsheets."

"Excellent." She nodded, with a more-than-reserved smile. "I want to.. make my mark again. On the fashion world. I was once VERY highly regarded. And I have a feeling, Anon, you're JUST the fresh blood I need, to excite mine."

"I have to admit.. it sounds like fun.. like.." He blushed a bit. "..it's a chance to do something really positive for someone, for once."

He meant more than those words.

She knew it.

She was still trying to be reserved about this.

After breakfast? They went to her design table. She had to.. kinda clear it off, as she had all kinds of things stacked on it. And dig out her sketch pencils. And her charcoals. And her pastels.

Anon watched all this, as she moved.. more like a chicken digging for worms, than an organized former Mistress of Fashion. He looked around the Design Room a bit, and saw that, indeed, she'd neglected it. Dust everywhere, boxes in one area, the works.

It was clear to him that she'd basically stopped designing for at least a few years. It made him even more nervous about showing her his ideas, but at the same time, it made him want to hlep her even more. She, clearly, was something special.. and he desperately wanted her to feel that again.

After she got the drafting table cleared off, she gestured for him to have a seat.

"Let me see what thoughts are in your Human brain, Anon." She said, with an air of softness. "I'm quite curious."

"Alright.." He shrugged, and slid into the stool.. that was almost comically too small for him, but he made it work by shifting his lower legs down.

As the table had a fresh sheet of design paper on it with the rough outline of a horse, he started drawing.. at first, he drew somethign simple and sporty - a half-skirt (covering the flanks only) with a quarter skirt bottom (covering up TO the flanks/legs) that vaguely resembled a wavey fold cheerleader skirt.. he added a top that was close cut and cut off at the shoulders. For color, he made it silver and blue, his old high school's colors.

It was, however, no cheerleader's outfit. It WAS.. a take on a sporting outfit for mares, that, while it evoked a sense of that youthful vibrance, it was more designed to flow with the wearer, while looking.. a bit more formal than, say, an aerobics outfit. It would do for tennis, perhaps polo, and so on. The top was given a loose slung collar.

"Oooo.. this is interesting." She leaned in. "I've never seen a skirt idea taken this way before." And tilted her head. "It allows more skirt, while still covering what it must. Flirty, fresh, sporty!" She tapped her hooves..

..she hadn't done that in ages.

"I'll get a loose working design going. Keep at it! This is amazing!" She basically cheered, started humming, and dragged over a pony mannequin.

"I'm glad you like it." He nodded. "That's not all I have in mind, either."

He got back to it, and immediately designed an evening gown that had three-quarter, front-only sleeves with a one-quarter rear that only reached the elbow. So the front can be formal, and the back of the sleeve functional. A slight poof at the shoulders, that flowed to a poof-shape-matching sash cinch and sash. He used carbon paper to trace this one, since he then colored it two ways. One was black with a hint of silver, the other was a dashing sea foam green, with gold hints. Both were accentuated with gemstones on the sash cinch, as that was on display at the hip.

Rarity barely had the first outfit prototyped when she realized that Anon had designed not only the evening gown, but a "slinky black dress" for less.. formal liasions. Cut up the flank to show the Cutie Mark, more than scandalously low in front to show off the chest floof, and while short, was again styled with different length 'top' and 'bottom' so it would neither drag nor require supporting seams to keep it close to the body.

"Anon, darling..! These.. are incredible!" She was GIDDY! GIDDY! "Ohh.. and the evening gown.. we could also do this in deep plum with a red sash, yes?"

"..yeah! Yeah! Daring plum with a blood red." He nodded. "Gold and green jewels for that."

"Hmm..! Yes. Yes, accessories are very important.. and, is this a comb?" She tapped the evening gown.

"A mane comb, yes, that's intended to be stuck permanently at that side, functioning like a tiara might, or similar mane jewelry. It can be used as a comb, or just left in place." He tapped at it.

"Amazing! Darling.." She smiled broadly. "..I think you have just the basic ideas the fashion world has needed for some time."

"Ahh.. I'm glad to hear it." He was blushing. "I never thought my ideas were any good. Wanna see what human girls wear?" He pulled out his cell phone and showed her a picture of that one girl from the office on a casual day - sweats, slutty spaghetti strap tank top, and slides.

"Eww..!" She recoiled in horror. "No wonder your ideas are so amazing. You were in a fashion desert, darling, and.. your heart cried out for something better..!" She smiled.. and blushed a bit herself. "Eh.. shall we have some tea?"

"Mmm? Oh! Yes, yes, tea would be great! We've been at this.." They both looked at the clock, and it was 1:45PM.

They'd STARTED at about 9AM.

"..lunch, then, darling?" She blinked.

"Lunch!" He nodded, with a grin.

"Hm!" She nodded a bit.

"Maybe we should get some fresh air and stretch our legs, eh? I mean.. the lady's home is gorgeous and all, but I don't get outside so much." He shrugged. "Not that it mattered, I lived in a very heavily populated city, there wasn't much place to get out TO that wasn't covered in concrete."

"OH! How horrible, Darling." She nodded a bit, and went to fetch a sun hat. "And when we get back, we must do something about your attire." She nodded to the poly-cotton Corpo Prisoner's Uniform. "Something more comfortable!"

"Sounds like an idea." He smirked.

With that, they went out to a cafe nearby.. and whom might be there, but a small flock of hens - that is, Mares, and among them was one particular up-and-coming designer..

"Ahh.. that's.. Sterling Bow." She nodded to her, as she.. intentionally sat as far from her as possible. "No respect on that one." She gave a tiny huff, as she picked up the menu. "If you want meat, the Griffon-style menu is in tan, Pony is in white."

"Well, I can eat anything but hay, really." He shrugged.

"Hmm! Good to know. Do you like carrots?" She asked, idly.

"Love 'em. And cucumbers, and broccoli.." He smiled. "And boiled eggs!"

"Hmmm! Darling, I think for the most part, we've a most compatible diet." She litled her head a bit. "I make a mean carrot risotto.." She started to say, as Sterling spotted her prey..

"Ah, if it isn't Equestria's most out-of-touch former fashion designer.." Sterling Bow said with insultingly haughty confidence, trotting up with her hens. "..and whatever THIS abominable thing is."

"..Rarity? You hear that? I thought I heard a sewer backing up?" Anon said, staring right at her, and not looking at Sterling.

"Indeed, Darling." She gave a short sniff. "Smells like it, too." She glanced at the menu. "Shame we're going to run away with the fashion show later this month, really.." She blinked, with her eyes half closed. "..it almost hurts not having any real competition with taste and flair."

"Indeed, indeed." Anon said, looking down at the menu. "Mmm.. gonna need to light a match, that smell isn't going away."

"YOU UNCOUTH BUMPKINS!" She sneered at them. "This is one of the finest Prench perfumes!" And snorted. "Rarity, your pet monkey doesn't seem to know his station!" She looked at Anon. "Not that I'd even let this creature polish my hooves. Disgusting two legged thing! Why don't YOU go BACK to whatever HOLE you CRAWLED OUT OF!?"

"Speaking about my new design partner like that, Sterling? How unbecoming of a lady." She brushed it off.

Anon did, too, still pretending to read the menu, even though he'd already decided.

"It figures a washed-up old hag like you needs the help of this ungainly creature to design the latest fashion in TRASH BAGS!" Sterling Bow hissed. "I don't even think the Garbage Ponies would be interested.." She got her snout closer to Rarity. "..in the filthy, ancient pencil sketches of a washed-up, never-was, geriatric old crone like you."

Anon turned to her with what could only be described as a death glare. He said nothing, he just stared at her... stared with eyes that had seen things, had known suffering, and.. suddenly valued her existence far less than that of an insect.

And held out one hand, with a strike-anywhere match in it.

"As I said, I need to light a match. The stench of sewage and failure grows thick, around here, and is utterly combustible." His words were delivered with absolute chilling ice.

Sterling.. paused.. having never seen eyes like that before. She blinked, and backed away.

"Whatever kindergarten crayon art you call fashion won't hold a candle to mine." She said, plainly, and trotted off, with her entourage.

Anon just stared after her, his eyes almost sunken in, like.. dead pools of jet black hatred.

"..Darling." Rarity leaned over a bit. "Darling?"

"HM!? Oh, sorry, Rarity." He bowed his head a bit. "I'm sorry. I.. got really mad."

"Regarding what she called you?" She said, somewhat expectantly.

"No.. uh.. how.. what she called YOU." He lowered his head even further. "I'm used to being insulted. I can take it. But.." He glanced up at her quickly retreating form as it went around a corner. "..not you. Not around me."

"Darling..!" She blinked, surprised. "Well.. I-I assure you I can defend myself socially.. but.." She blushed. "..having a knight in shining armor ride to my rescue like that was.." And looked down a bit. "..welcomely unexpected."

"Uh. Yeah." He blushed a bit.. was he developing a crush on his boss?

He didn't want to think about that, but he was. Even as he ate, and Rarity started going on about different specific dresses she'd made, he was staring at her. Watching her smiles, her movements, how her hair bounced...

But, his eyes weren't seeing a unicorn pony, they were seeing something else. Someone with grace and elegance. Beauty.. beauty inside themselves. The Generosity she was marked for, giving him a place to stay and a real job.

For the first time in over a decade, he felt something stirring within him. Not just repressed ideas, no.. something else. Something.. emotional.

Had he truly been dead inside so long?

He ate everything on his plate, without thinking about it, the entire time, allowing his soul to fill up with that positive warmth this Lady was exhuding. He smiled. Broadly.

"..and I said, of course, two white dresses would be silly, since I know you're both not virgins." She tilted her head. "Anon, did.. you hear anything I was saying?"

"Ahh..." He turned red. "..not really." And lowered his face. "I.. um.. I was.. I was thinking about something we could create together that would put Sterling in her place, once and for all!" Yeah, that's it, redirect and don't admit that you're crushing hard.

"..oh! Yes, yes." She brushed it off, too, but in the back of her mind, she had a clue he wasn't being fully honest, and why. "Well, that was a lovely lunch. Now, we should return to the studio.." And a sharp smirk. "..and create the masterpieces that will, indeed, humiliate Sterling and her so-called sense of fashion." And wiggled her brows, deviously.

"I do have a few ideas." Anon said, shrugging. "Ahh.. do they leave tips in these parts?"

"Depends, honestly. The nicer the restaurant, the more you're expected to leave one." She smiled a bit. "I usually leave one for Stitchen Thyme, though, he's always good to me." She said, depositing the bits for the meal. "This place may not be fancy, but he's always been a gentleman."

"Huh. Most places in my part of humanland ask for some kind of a tip. You're only expected to give one at a sit-down restaurant or someplace where crafting your meal takes some real effort." He shrugged a bit, getting up as she did.

"Interesting." She noted. "So.. what are you thinking?" She means about the dress.

"Well, that, if I'm going to get anywhere, I really need to leave an impression.." He wasn't.

"..oh? Oh!" She blushed. "I meant about your idea to WOW them, Darling." And smiled a bit.

"Ah! Ahh." He blushed a bit, too. "As with many things.. not in public. Lest the walls have ears." He made a show of glancing around shiftily.

"Ha-ha! You're such a card, Anon, Darling!" She smiled broadly. "But, you're right." She said, slightly increasing her pace towards her botique. "Walls, and foals, have big ears.."

After they arrived, they both went back to the design room.. and Anon slid right back into the drafting table.

"How formal and elegant can I go?" He asked, looking at her with a cocked brow.

"Hm.. go nuts." She wiggled hers, and slid another pony mannequin over, to work on another one of Anon's design.

Anon? Had the most devious idea. And he intentionally designed two elegant 'event dresses.' One of them was gauche and radical. The other was a Louis the 14th-inspired Ball Gown with very pony appointments, and his now-signature quarter-bottom covering, but with a slight bustle in the caboose.

"..why the crazy design, Anon?" Rarity leaned over.

"I have a feeling she's going to try some sabotage and espionage. Go ahead and assemble the crazy dress, but leave it loosely basted. Don't put all your effort into it. This one.." He tapped the Ball Gown. "..do it, but get it off the mannequin fast and into a closet where it won't be found. I'll leave a slighlty updated version of the Crazy Dress where it can be found.." He smirked.

"You really think she would?" Rarity blinked, and shrugged, but levitated a bunch of materials over.

"Just.. the way she went off about it. She's too defensive about talent, and I think she's one of those that faked it until she made it." He nodded a bit.

"Huh." She started assembling the Crazy Dress. "..Anon, these lines.."

"I know what I'm doing." He grinned broadly. "Trust me?"

"Ohhh.. I didn't think humans could be so.. deliciosuly devious!" She cackled a little. "Darling, I love it!"

Indeed, they spent the rest of the afternoon going through every category in the event and making three designs, then picking one design to create for the event itself, and a second as a backup.

The "crazy dress" was (they were pretending) being reserved for the "open formal" category. The most important one, actually, given the prestige involved. And it was set on its pony mannequin, positioned precisely in the center of the design room to signify this.

"Mm. I kinda hope she falls for this." She nodded a bit. "It would certainly cement me some fame, for sure."

"You kidding? We used to call this 'Trolling' in my world. As in, trolling for a reaction? If she sees this, she's GOING to think we're trying to break new fashion ground, and that'll be an irresistable bit of bait." He smirked, sipping tea.

"Hmm-hmm!" She grinned. "Come, let's get to bed. We've much to do tomorrow to finalize these outfits." She prodded him off the seat, and making sure he stretched and popped his back.

The two of them retired for the evening, and left everything.. right where it could be found.

The next day, before breakfast, the two of them slid into the studio to see if the trap had worked.

"..she took the updated design paper." He nodded, with a broad grin.

"Hmm.. she also de-stitched a few areas here, and stitched some of the pleats shut. Clearly done to pass casual inspection. Not bad. She's good at sabotage.." She tapped her hoof to her chin.

"..maybe a wooden sabo is her cutie mark?" He smirked at her.

"HAH!" She giggled. "Oh, yes, darling, that would be amazing!" And after she stopped and sighed.. "..breakfast?"

"Let's." He nodded back.

Over breakfast that morning, the two of them spent much time looking each other over. What they didn't know, was, someone ELSE was spying on them...


"..looks like it's working." The pinker one nodded. "Your Crystal Ball comes in handy, love."

"Mmm.." She blinked at the ball, and nodded. "I think they've got that spark." She shrugged. "I wonder what the babies will look like?"

"They'll probably adopt. I mean.. even if Rarity could carry a foal at her age, still, I don't think they're compatible in that way." She tapped a hoof to her chin. "Wonder if I could make a spell for that, too?"

"Don't reach so hard for the Moon, honey." She slithered over. "But, I have to admit.. this might just be the Great and Powerful happy ending that she deserves." She nuzzled the other mare. "Conscience."

"Nonsense!" She snorted a bit, but wiggled a bit at the attention. "I just.. can't.. don't want her to be a weepy old lady, is all! And.. what are you doing with that mane brush?!"

"Shhh. Let it happen." The other one said, nipping her ear.


Back in the botiuque.. the pair were working on the dresses themselves. Each little stitch, some minor alterations here and there, and the secret work on the "Baroque Revival" ball gown, took the two of them to another world of focus and mutual cooperation, such that the human and the pony flowed together like two streams long destined to create a great river.

Dinner time rolled around, though neither realized their hunger, as this evening was spent creating and crafting. Finally, around nine in the evening, though... the rumble of Anon's belly alerted them to this need.

"Oh! I guess I'm hungry!" He patted his belly.

"Seems we both are." She patted her own. "I think we skipped lunch, darling!"

"I think we did." He grinned back at her.

"Come, come. Let's go make something, hm?" She ushured him off to the Kitchen.

"Yeah." He smiled.. realizing he'd spent the whole day with her, without saying a word, and.. connecting.

Rarity realized the same thing, too, and was blushing the whole way to the kitchen. She brought out some vegetables and a chicken breast.

"Grilled chicken ceasar salad?" He smirked.

"Oh! Uhm.. what's a Ceasar?" She blinked a bit, and leaned her head to the side.

"He was a ruler of ancient Rome." Anon nodded.

"Oh, like Princess Twilight.. and Celestia.. so.. you mean a Grilled Chicken Celestia Salad! Yes, yes, that sounds lovely." She smiled.

"I.. I don't know who's doing what around here." He turned to face her, to get the chicken. "I.. I've been too focused on you." And he blushed.

She did as well.

"Truth, darling, so have I." She lowered her head a bit. "I can't remember a time I've fit so well with another.. like.." She looked up. "..ah, I'm silly!"

"Silly?" He smirked. "Nah. It's not silly." He shrugged.

"..well, I was going to say, like we were made for each other, but that's so silly to say.." She lowered her head again.

"Why?" He asked, lowering himself a little. "I mean, I feel the same way, and I've never felt like this before."

"I..." She looked up into his eyes, and she was flushed in the face. "..haven't even let you court me, properly?"

He leaned in and went for it.


"THEY KISSED!" The pinker mare exclaimed, looking through the crystal ball.

"NO WAY!" The other mare said, scooting over. "Oh, DAMN! I had no idea Rarity had tongue skills as good as the Great and Powerful Me.." She cocked a brow.

"Voyeur!" The pinker mare hissed.

"Yes, and?" She smirked.


When they finally broke the kiss, though, they were both panting heavily.

"I.. I've never." She blinked.

"Me, either." He smiled.

*Ahem* "I.." She raised her head, regaining her composure. "..am still a proper lady." And nodded a bit. "And I want to see just how truly compatible we are." And blushed a bit. "Not that I'm not curious, but.."

"I get it. I feel the same way." He patted her cheek. "I don't want to give in to pure horomones and all that. I want to know we both.." He gestured. "..really want to go that far."

She grinned brightly, blushing, and nodding.

"We do have a lot in common, then!" She wiggled a brow.

As they prepared dinner, the two of them were a bit preoccupied with thoughts of each other. Shockingly similar ones, really, as they came to grips with each their own realization that they were attracted to something not their species at all.

This was an internal monologue from each of them, both wondering similar things, but both wrestling with their conscience about this. They both wanted it as much as the other, but they both wanted to "do it right" after having had it done WRONG on them before.

They wanted to do this together.

Moreover, they wanted to win that fashion show.

Predictably, though..

"That was a lovely dinner." Anon nodded to her.

"Indeed." She smiled up at him. "Tell me, Anon, have you had any relationships before? Serious ones?" She asked, leaning into the table a bit.

"Ehh.. I had a few here and thre. Short stuff. Never worked out. One girl I dated wanted.." He gestured a bit. "..a lot of physical contact, but.." He shook his head, looking slightly away. "..there was no emotion in it." And frowned. "Maybe I'm jsut old fashioned, but.. I don't.. like the idea of doing that without real feelings to go with it." He sighed.

"I.. don't think that's old fashioned at all.." She blushed just a bit. "..I had a similar encounter, once, though we never progressed that far."

"I see." He nodded a bit. "Well.. we should get to bed. We still have a lot of work to do, and the fashion show is.. when?"

"Seven days." She nodded firmly. "I already sent off my confirmation in the mail." And grinned, just a bit. "We've got them by their tails, Anon, I know it."

"I know it, too." He grinned widely, getting up, and pacing over to her. "Good night, Rarity." And kissed her on the cheek.

Such a simple act of loving familiarity, and she blushed redder than she ever had before. NEW feelings were creeping up inside the not-yet-middle-aged mare. Feelings she never thought she'd ever have.

Tenderness.

Comfortability.

Affection on a deep level.

Adoration.

And, yet, here she was. Sitting, smiling, at the dinner table, a full five minutes after he went to bed, staring at his bedroom door, wondering.. not DARING to question what terrific magics brought him here, but silently praying they'd not try to take him back...

..and swearing on her very life that she would destroy them utterly, if they did.

The next two days were nothing more than dress construction. Th two of them working tirelessly to get each one just right, making adjustments, and even adding to the Crazy Dress, knowing someone was spying on them.

The dress was a trap. And they were falling for it.

Now five days since Anon arrived, and the routine between them was becoming tenderly familiar. They worked on the fashion, they broke for lunch IF they remembered, and they talked about each other.

One thing Rarity mentioned offhand was Sweetie Belle.

Lunch on that fifth day...

"So, you don't really approve of the guy?" Anon tilted his head.

"Not.. not really. I think she could have done better." Rarity shrugged. "He takes care of her, th-"

She was cut off by a knock, then sudden entrance, of someone at the front of the botique.

"SIS! SIS!? WHERE ARE YOU!?" The voice was.. distressed.

"Sweetie Belle?!" She got up, but stayed at the table. "Back here, darling!"

In came Sweetie Belle, herself now 21 years old. A full adult. And.. she looks very upset. She's got a blouse on, and a skort. For the uninitiated, that's a skirt with a pair of shorts attached on the inside, to properly cover one's lady bits.

"Sweetie.. what's the matter?!" Rarity bid her to sit.

"I.." She saw Anon. "WHAT is THAT?!" She pointed with a hoof.

"I'm Anon." He shrugged. "I'm a human."

"Oh." She shrugged a bit, and sat. "Rarity.. I.. I think I made a big mistake." She sighed.. then the tears gently came down her snout.

"Oh.. dear Sister. What happened?" No judgment, just concern, befitting a Lady of true class.

"I.." She gently rubbed her belly. "..I'm in trouble."

"Trou-" She stopped, putting the pieces together. "-and where is he?" She cut that one, like, she expected an answer that would anger her.

Anon picked up on it, but he kept his cool, sipping his tea.

"He's.. he took a job in Marechester." She shrugged. "He said I could come with, but.." She looked down. "..I told him, I didn't want to leave Ponyville."

"And what was his reaction?" Anon asked, evenly.

Rarity flicked him a look, but let him inquire.

"That.. that I ought to just go with him." She quivered in her voice.

"Like, he expects you to?" Anon pressed.

"Yeah.." She trailed off, sadly.

"Has he.. cut down the time you spend with your friends? You know, insisted he have all your attention?" Anon tilted his head, and sipped again.

"Yeah!" She looked at him, curiously. "How'd you know?"

"Rarity.." Anon looked down, and then over to her. "..she needs to get away from him. For good. That man.. pony, whatever.. he's an abuser. That's classic abusive behavior in human land. Isolate the target, make it so they can't reach out, then jerk them away from their home and keep them somewhere they can't make social connections, so they're entirely dependant on their abuser for everything." Then back to Sweetie Belle. "And, I'm guessing, you love him with all your heart and can't imagine living without him?"

"Y.. yeah.." She looked down at the table. "..how'd'you know all this?"

"I've seen it happen before." He nodded a bit.. and looked at Rarity with sympathy.

"I trust Anon, sister. He's been.. you don't even know. So helpful, so supportive.. he's gotten me back into fashion!" She smiled, but it faded. "If Anon thinks he's going to hurt you, somehow, I think he might be right." She patted her sister's hoof. "Sweetie."

"Ohhhhh...!" She cried. "I just didn't want you an' Mom to be right!!" She sobbed. "I wanted to be right, for once! About somethin' important!" And she slumped into the table, covering her eyes with her foreleg. "I wanted to be.. a smart.. adult.. for once."

Feelings of failure and being looked down upon for bad judgment - social shame - being one reason why those in bad relationships initially refuse to acknowledge the truth. Here, though, such barriers aren't as harsh.. perhaps one of the many reasons why Sweetie was so willing to open up in the first place.

A close connection to her dear sister, being another.

"Sweetie.." Rarity slid over and hugged on her. "..I only ever wanted what's best for you. Whatever makes you happy." She brought her hoof under her sister's chin. "Anything. I'm here. I'll always BE here.. no matter what."

"Thank ya, Sis.." She sniffled.

"So, what's his name? I guarantee he's going to show up, here, soon, chasing her and demanding she come back with him. I mean, if ponies here have the same mental processes as humans." He shrugged.

"H.." She looked up at Anon. "..his name's Cutting Bow. He's a tailor." And shrugged.

Rarity fixed Anon with a look, like, did he now understand why this was so personal?

Anon just nodded back with a grin.. a grim one, but a grin none the less. This fashion show wasn't just her return to the stage, it was an endorsement against her new rival, AND a shot at the one she long suspected was mistreating her sister...

..a Lady indeed. A Lady with the mentality, resources, and wherewithal to utterly destroy her social enemies.

They kept Sweetie at the botique for a couple hours, and let her vent. Tears and tea make for unusual, but familiar, partners. Especially when sisters are trying to make amends, and handle a problem. In this case, Cutting.

The usual suspects were all present. Mean comments about her looks, suggestions of her diet, implications that she wasn't as cute as when they first met, all the classic signs of an emotional abuser.

He'd never raised a hoof to her, though. That, at least, was a line he hadn't crossed, yet.

"..but, I'm sure he will, once he has an opportunity." Anon shrugged. "Like I said, I've seen this before."

"Anon, Darling, may I ask..?" Rarity tilted her head at him, her face full of concern.

"My mother." He nodded, looking down at his teacup long empty. "And my stepdad." And frowned. "It's why I left home as soon as I could. I.." He frowned harder. "..he hit her. Hit me a few times. Called me fat and stupid. Said I'd never make it out there. That I was a wuss. And a.." He looked at Rarity. "..he was horrible, but my mom never left him. Finally, she died. Police ruled it natural causes, but I know he did it. You don't jsut develop a brain bleed out of the blue. He boxed her down like she was a punching dummy. That's probably what did it."

"Anon..!" Rarity was flabbergasted. "I've never heard of such things!"

"And yet, it happened. I'm not saying this guy will go THAT far, but it's possible he'll smack her around." He wagged a finger, pointing up. "And if he does it while she's pregnant?"

"I see what you mean." Rarity scowled. She didn't want to consider the possibility, but..

"Ahhhwhh.." Sweetie mewled. "..I wanna say I don't think he would, but.."

Another knock.

Harder. Insisting. Demanding.

"That's him. I guarantee it." He frowned, but got up. "Rarity, would you trust me?"

"Implicity.. my darling." She slid over to Sweetie's other side, defensively.

And Anon went to answer the door.

"BELLE!? Are you here!?" Came the call from the door, that of a stallion.

"Yup." And he opened it. "Hello, there, friend! I'm Anon!" He stepped out, grinning widely. "Let's you and me have a little chat, hm?" He didn't 'ask' exactly, but he shut the door behind him, and put a hand gently on Cutting's shoulder, to guide him.

"ANON!? Who the heck are you!?" Cutting asked.. nay, demanded.

"A close friend of Rarity's." He shrugged, leading him around the side of the building, where there was an open window.. so they had an audience.

"My sister warned me she was working with some kinda freak." He snorted. "So, you're the monkey, huh?" He poked a hoof towards Anon's chest, but did not make contact. "What I got going with Sweetie Belle has nothing to do with you."

"Oh.. but it does." Anon looked down at him. "Since I'm close to her sister, whatever affects Sweetie, has an effect on Rarity. And I can't very well have her distracted with that fashion show coming up. Never mind not wanting to see a pretty lady in distress."

"A freak like you? HAH!" He snorted, waving his right hoof dismissively. "Whatever. This isn't your business, anyway. I'm here to take her back home!"

"And what if she doesn't want to go?" Anon asked, his voice almost lilting, his head tilting, his eyes studying his opponent.

"She does. She just doesn't realize it. That's MY FOAL in her stomach. And she's going to have it WITH ME." He tapped his chest, assertively.

"And if she resists your.. kind invitation?" He was smirking, now..

"She won't." He glared. "And neither you nor that washed-up has-been are going to stop me."

"I think that's exactly what I'm going to do." Anon rolled his shoulders. "You want Sweetie Belle? You get through me, first."

"You.. monkey son-of-a-bitch...!" He started, incredulously. "YOU GOT NO RIGHT!" He poked Anon's chest.

"I have EVERY right to protect a lady in distress. The question is, do YOU have the stones to try and move me?" He rolled his neck a bit, but left his expression neutral.

"I.. you.." He snorted.. no.. chuffed, with his ears pinned back, and his eyes slightly narrowed. A Stallion's big warning that violence is in the offing.

Anon waited.. waited for him to do something.

The two males locked eyes for at least two minutes, Cutting trying to decide if he would take that step or not.

"Well?" Anon asked, his tone bored. "I don't have all day."

"ERGHH!" Cutting snorted, but started to pace off and disengage. "This ain't over!"

"No, I think it is." Anon shrugged. "Go back to Marechester and make clothes. Find some other girl to rope in. Sweetie Belle is not your property any more." And lowered his expression to one of absolute death incarnate.. as if to say.. had Cutting taken that step.. he would not be breathing any longer.

And really, what trouble would Anon have gotten into? He's with one of the old Elements of Harmony. Who's personal friends with the Princess! Cutting put all this together.. and just walked away.

Defeated Male Leaves.

And Anon cracked the WIDEST grin he ever had! Not only had he stood down a Bully, he did it without throwing a single hand. Pure intimidation. Pure mental 6D Chess.

And back inside he went, grinning insufferably from ear to ear.

"He won't be a problem for a while." He re-entered, and gave a small bow.

"Anon.." Rarity started, smirking. "That was, at once, the most masculine, AND smartest thing I've ever seen." She nodded a bit. "You outsmarted him."

"More that, I know bullies don't like to pick on someone their own size, and used that to my advantage to intimidate him." He shrugged. "He backed down, rather than risk crossing a line that shouldn't be crossed. I took into account how the culture around here works, too. The idea that actual violence is more than a last resort - that aggression is taboo." He gestured a bit.

"Mmm." Rarity hummed with adoration.

"Thank you, Anon." Sweetie Belle sighed. "NOW what do I do?!"

"Surround yourself with friends." He nodded. "Good ones. Ones that'll stand up to that creep. Bullies don't like crowds, either, unless they have an entourage, and he doesn't." And half-shrugged to his right side.

"Alright. Can I stay the night, sis?" She cuddled into her sister, protectively.

"Sure, Darling." She smiled warmly.

"I'll take the couch." Anon pointed to it. "She's your sister - she deserves the guest room."

Rarity.. paused. No, froze. No, no, those thoughts were improper. Noooo.. not yet.

But, yet...

"If you promise to be a perfect gentleman, you can share my bed. Celestia knows it's large enough." She shrugged casually.

"Uh.. okay?" Anon shrugged again, a little confused.

"Hee-hee.. no hanky-panky, sis!" Sweetie Belle teased.

Anon, then, turned absolutely red faced and played with his hands a bit. While thhey HAD kissed, THAT was not on his mind at ALL...

"..perfect gentleman, I swear!" He crossed his heart with his fingers.

"Excellent, Darling. Now.. we should make dinner. It's getting late." She smiled a bit, and went towards the kitchen. "Join me, Anon, Darling?"

"Ah, yes, of course." He nodded, and followed.

"Anon.." She started, once they were in there, and she began telekinetically taking ingredients out.

"Yes, Rarity..?" His voice quivered a bit.

"I.. one reason I never really looked too hard for a mate was.. I was worried about my sister. I was worried that whomstever I became romantic with, wouldn't.. put her needs high enough." She shrugged, almost sadly. "She is so very dear to me." She looked up, then over to him. "I raised her." And shrugged a bit. "She's as much mine as she is my parents."

"I understand, a bit." He nodded. "If there's nothing else in this world, there's family." He smiled a bit. "I.. I'm starting to understand what that means."

Dinner that night was salad and hay for the ladies, and ham steak and salad for Anon. Over dinner, Sweetie Belle quizzed Anon about everything Rarity had, being fascinted with her savior.. and her sister's apparent love interest.

While Anon went to get the beds straight, they talked.

"You should totally get with him, sis." Sweetie started, sipping her herbal tea.

"Sweetie Belle!" She wasn't shocked or offended by her bold tongue, though.

"I bet he's wild in the sack!" She giggled just a bit, then stopped. "No, sis, I mean it. He seems really nice, and like he really, really likes you. You better get with him, because you might not have any other chances. And he's TOTALLY into you!" She beamed a grin.

"Sweetie Belle.." Rarity trailed off. "..I suppose you have a point, darling. He IS rather masculine, isn't he?" She smiled, a bit dreamily.

"Sure is. And he can handle himself, and he can design dresses.. come on, Sis! You two were MADE for each other!" She cheered her sister on.

"Well.." Rarity looked down into her tea cup. "..I don't want to just breeze through everything, of course, but.." She looked up at her sister. "..I suppose I should take the chance." And smiled. "He's a great kisser."

"SIS!" Sweetie Belle pretended to be shocked. "Naughty!" And giggled.

Later on, once Rarity came into her bedroom, she saw that Anon had indeed set her (very large by pony standards) bed up so that his covers were totally independent. He was just finishing setting up pillows, too.

"Anon." She started. "Thank you again for looking out for my little sister." And nodded, slipping onto the mattress. "I see you've.. secured the bed."

"No hanky-panky from me. Promise. And if I start snoring, just roll me over." He shrugged. "Supposedly, I snore when I'm on my back."

"I shall keep that in mind, darling." She said, getting comfortable.

For his part, Anon basically cocooned himself in his own sheets, being very careful that there was no overlap. He was rather nervous, considering he'd.. it'd been easily 15 years since he shared a bed with another person.

Person?

Pony?

Did it matter?

It was really starting not to. Ever since the kiss, he was questioning if the whole species thing.. really mattered at all. After all, there were no other humans here.

Huh. Wonder what the kids would look like?

Adoption?

He was kicking himself for thinking that way. Was it proper? Did that kiss they shared, mean everything he wanted it to? He didn't know, for sure. He wanted it to, but...

A new day dawns. Sweetie Belle was up early, and had made breakfast for them all. She even took into account that Anon needed meat, and had thinly sliced some ham steak into what Anon would call "imitation Canadian Bacon."

"Hope you like it." She smiled a bit. "Rarity's a better cook, though."

"Ah, thank you." He sat and sniffed. "Smells great!"

"Indeed, darling." She tilted her head. "My dear sister learned from the best." She coyly put a hoof to her chest.

"So, Anon.." Sweetie Belle sat down. "..how.. what do I do, now? I mean.." She frowned a bit.

"Make a clean break from him, and go seek the company of your closest friends. Stay with them, stay around them. Safety in numbers, and he will eventually seek easier prey." He shrugged. "I mean, from a legal stand point, he never hit you, so, there's really no crime here. And who knows? Maybe in a world like this, there's someone who absolutely wants to be his little pet-slave-thing? Like, that's their special talent."

"..hm! I never thought of it THAT way, Darling, but I suppose you might be right!" Rarity grinned. "There may well be a Mare out there for him who's special talent is subservience? After all, where there's rain, there's clouds, too, no?"

"Huh!" Sweete Belle blinked. "And maybe I just kinda put off the wrong feeling, then, maybe?"

"I'd say that's possible. You were driven to be proven right, he was a social familiar, and because of that, you accepted far more than you ordinarily would." A bit of a shrug. "Only when you realized that this was wrong, that it FELT wrong, did things go south."

"Yeah, huh!" She tapped her chin with her hoof. "Thanks, Anon!" She beamed a grin.

"See, I'm not just good at designing clothes." He shrugged.

"As I can tell. Speaking of which, we need to finish the rest of those this afternoon. It shouldn't be much." She shrugged. "Sweetie..? I know it's a lot to ask, but.. would you mind modelling for us? We.. ah.. rather made them more or less your size."

"I'd LOVE to, Sis!" She clapped her hooves, rapidly, in glee. "It'll be a great way to get my mind off of things! AND, I can finally do something for you!"

"Sweetie, you just being my sister, does something for me." She hugged her, and Sweetie Belle hugged back.

IF there was ANY rift here between sisters, it was closed, now. Solidly. And it would not have been so, had Anon not shown up.

A detail not lost...


"..damn, maybe we should've kept him for ourselves." The pinkish Unicorn tapped her chin, looking into the crystal ball.

"He IS quite the keeper, hm?" The periwinkle one slid up over the other's shoulders. "Maybe if we'd met an actual stallion like him."

"Maybe. But, it looks like he's meeting all her standards. And then some. I mean, look at him! She's treating him like family already!"

"No kidding, honey." An ear nibble. "You always DID have a good eye for things like this." And a shrug. "I mean, you almost took over the world, and all."

"A LOOONG time ago, lover." She nuzzled back. "And I've been trying to be the best I can be, ever since. Always saying sorry, even if I don't mean it.." She sighed. "..but this time, I did something RIGHT." She nodded firmly.

"You sure did, hon." The other mare rolled over. "Come on, I want to go shopping!"


..on their silent observers.

That afternoon, the three of them worked on the dresses...

"And.. if I'm right.." She slid the Baroque Revival dress over Sweetie's shoulders. "..it's perfect." She nodded. "Anon, some more of the silver thread, so I can secure this."

"Here you are." He nodded, passing it to her. "Yeah, it looks amazing on her."

"And with my additions, it should absolutely torpedo that harridan.." She smirked.

"Ahhh.." Sweetie nodded. "..my sister's getting her guts back. About time!"

"Anon helped greatly, darling.." She trailed that off just a bit, as she got the stitches in.

"I can see that." She smiled at him, giving him a wink of approval when Rarity wasn't looking.

"I can't wait to see how this goes. What're the festivities supposed to be?" He asked, getting another bolt of material.

"Well.. each category has their own time slot, then the formal category is last." She nodded. "In between the rest of the categories and the Formal Wear one, there's a break, as the Formal category has the most entrants. The break is usually a buffet and drinks."

"Hm." Anon nodded. "Good thing I can hold my liquor." He shrugged. "You learn to, having to deal with businesspeople."

"I think I know you well enough.." She trailed off, with pins in her mouth. "..you'll exercise due restraint."

"Oh, yeah. A glass or two, nursed, to look social and give me excuses." He shrugged, laying out the cut fabric for Rarity to attach.

"Hm!" Sweetie Belle grinned. "Sounds like ya got it all worked out."

"More or less." Anon nodded. "We have surprises, too." He smirked.

"INDEED, Darling!" Rarity grinned wickedly.

"Oh? Gonna tell me?" Sweetie Belle tilted her head.

"Be more fun if you see it happen live." Anon smirked. "You'll like it, trust me."

"Hmmm.. I guess, I should." She leaned into that phrase. "After all, you're probably going to wind up my brother-in-law."

DEAD.

SILENCE.

They both froze.

Sweetie Belle looked absolutely innocent, rolling her eyes, and gently whistling a nonsense tune.

"Sweetie!" Rarity was flush-faced.

"Re-Really.." Anon was uncomfortable.

"Oh, come on! You two act like two halves of a hay sandwich!" She stuck her tongue out a bit. "You're perfect for each other. Even if it's not today or tomorrow, it's GONNA happen." She shrugged, hoof upturned.

"That.. that is entirely up to Mr. Anon Y Mous." She blushed.

"Yeah.. uh. That's kinda up to Rarity.." He said.

At the same time. Talking over each other.

They looked each other in the eye, both remembering The Kiss. And both blushed, and turned away, each working on something different, to distract themselves from their feelings.

Sweetie Belle, on the other hand? Just grinned. She knew darn well what she'd just nudged, and she wanted to do a lot more.

She had no idea there was already a conspiracy going on.

Later that evening, though..


"I think this is a mis-taa-aake.." The periwinkle one said.

"Nah, it's cool." Her pink associate said.

They intercepted Sweetie Belle on her way back to her place.

"Hey, Sweetie Belle.." The Pink one started in.

"OH! What are you two doing, all the way out here?!" She trotted over, all happy.

"My dear marefriend is trying her hardest to help your sister.. and we need a pony on the inside." The Periwinkle one nodded. "Care to lend a hoof?"

"Oh, really?" She smirked. "THIS.. should be GOOD.." And broadened her smile. "Come on, I know a great place for shakes. My treat, even. Let's go talk.. business."


..forces working 'against' Rarity and Anon were on the move, and recruiting a new ally in their endeavor.

Meanwhile, Rarity and Anon were having a quiet dinner. Staring at each other.

"Er.. now that your sister's gone home.. I'll.. take the guest room over.. again.." He said, a bit uncomfortably.

"Y-Yes of course, darling." She flushed a bit, thinking still about the fact that she'd actually slept in the same bed as him once already.

"I uh.. I think we'll be done with everything tomorrow, pretty early. Care to.. maybe.. go out for lunch, then?" He chirped up.

"Certainly, darling!" She smiled. "I have just the outfit to wear."

"Yeah." He nodded. "And I should have a new one by then, too." And shrugged.

"Oh, yes, darling. I'd almost forgotten we'd made you some clothes, too. Hmm.. wear the dark jacket and light shirt, with the red tie. I can match that." She tapped her hoof to her chin.

"Sounds great!" He smiled.

But, really, she was thinking about having actual 'arm candy' for once. And he was thinking about her being happy.

The suit made for him was similar to the one he arrived in, but nicer, lighter fabrics and, of course, stitched with Rarity's usual care. The suit coat had an inside pocket, too. The shirt was blue with a white collar, and the tie was medium width, red, with blue stripes just slightly darker than the blue on the shirt, to tie it together. The pants, of course, matched the suit coat.

"Spaghetti?" He asked, exiting the guest room in his new suit.

"Spaghetti, darling." She said, exiting in a slinky black number, with low heels, and a little casual bling, accentuated with a light shawl and a rather dangerous looking black hat.

With that, the two went to Sanolini's restaurant. When the waiter asked about wine, she selected. When the waiter asked for their order, Anon spelled it out. The entire time, though, they were staring into each others' eyes.. their other movements mechanical and distracted, as they got lost in each other's souls.

Not that seeing Anon all handsome'd up, and Rarity prettier than anyone in town had ever seen her, didn't turn some heads. In the best of ways, Rarity was showing that she was not only off the market, but had scored someone unique and fascinating. Not a single witness could say Anon was anything but a perfect gentlestallion.

Maybe that's what sent.. her.. over the edge. The rumor that her rival was romancing something so foreign and strange. One that had insulted her family, at least in her mind. The confirmation of their familiarity, from mutual acquaintences. The witnesses, seeing him dressed so sharp, floating along the avenue with her.

And all of these revelations.. not knowing the genuine touch of another.. discarding emotional closeness for a career.. left -her- seeing green.

They didn't know it, but Rarity's rival had sworn a blood oath of revenge on her that very night. To be carried out around that fashion show.. in the most brutal fashion.

This rival's intent was humiliation, plain and simple. Disgrace. Social disfigurement. Dismissal. Destruction.

Little did EITHER Rarity or her sworn enemy know, there was a conspiracy in place, far grander than this rival's amateurish schemes. A pair of professional badmares.. with miles of 'evil' experience.. watching from afar, mindful of their ultimate mission.


"We should have stopped her." The periwinkle one frowned.

"Nah." The pink one shrugged, looking into the crystal ball. "She didn't do much REAL damage. She's an amateur at this sort of stuff." And smirked.

"Still.." The other one sighed. "..anyway, Sweetie knows what to do tomorrow."

"Excellent." The pinker one smirked. "I'm rather enjoying this!"

"Mmmm.." Her friend hummed, sliding up next to her. "..putting your devious mind to good use. It's sexy."

"I know it is!" She beamed a grin.


And soon, the dating pair arrived home.

"Anon, that was an amazing evening." She started, as they got back to her place. "You.. were quite the gentlecolt."

"You're such an amazing Lady, how can I -not- be?" He smiled.

She blushed.

"Thank you, Anon, I-" She lit up the room with the wall switch.

And.. the place is trashed. Crass vandalism. Bolts of cloth tossed and unrolled, her sewing kits dumped out, several dresses defaced and sliced apart, her shears jammed into the wall..

Rairty just.. slowly narrowed her eyes, and pursed her lips.

Anon blinked, and flexed his fingers.. gripping them tightly into balled fists.

"Not that we didn't expect this." She snorted steam, she was so furious. "But it still hurts."

"They.. went further than I thought they would.." He started manually picking things up..

..when EVERYTHING levitated.

"Hold still." She said, quietly.

It took her a few minutes, but she managed to re-sort everything back to where it was supposed to be. Mind, she could not repair the damaged fabrics, but she COULD re-sort her botique. As she was setting the stands back, one of them glowed purple.

"H-Hey, Rarity.." An unfamiliar-to-Anon voice started in.

In marched the Princess of Friendship. Twilight Sparkle. She nodded to Anon, and came up behind her old friend, and helped her, using her own magic to set the stands right where they needed to be, all at once, like a little army.

"..Twilight." She blinked, still furious. "I know who did it."

"I-I think I do, too.." She sighed. "And who are you?"

"Anon Y Mous." He shrugged. "I'm a human. Someone brought me here. Best thing that ever happened to me."

"..I care for him a great deal, Twilight." She was just about grinding her teeth, glaring at her old friend, ready to throw hooves.

Anon didn't get why. He didn't know Twilight's proclivites to jumping to conclusions - she'd largely matured out of that, but she still had her moments of weakness. Protecting her friends was a sure trigger.

"Oh, no-no-no. I-I wasn't going to.." She stepped back as Rarity turned around to face her, slightly bowing.

"Good." She nodded. "I would hate to have to ruin our friendship over him." She glared a little more, but let it go, her eyes going sad for a moment. "I could not stand two doses of bad news in one night."

"Oh, Rarity!" She slid her forelegs around her. "Okay, so.. I was thinking about it.. when I heard.. I mean.. what I was told is not what I'm seeing here." She sighed.

"What WERE you told, darling?" Her tone softened, and she pulled back a bit.

"Ehh.." She rubbed her right leg with her left fetlock. "..that he was some strange alien that goes around threatening everypony with violence?"

"For one thing, darling, he's as gentle as Fluttershy's tail-"

*Tiny "Yay!" from outside*

Rarity paused, walked outside, and nudged Fluttershy into the room.

"-As I was saying, he's as gentle as her tail. He's sweet, and kind, and, yes, protective. He defended Sweetie Belle from her now-ex-coltfriend, whom was emotionally abusing her. Without raising a hoof, I should add. He bluffed the cad. And made him.. punk out." She raised her head with an alluring haughty gaze. "Proving himself an Alpha." She smirked, with a raised brow.

"O-oh my.." Fluttershy blushed, and looked at Anon, smiling, and extending her hoof. "I'm Fluttershy, one of Rarity's friends."

"I'm Anon." He bowed to her a bit, and shook hoof-and-hand with her. "I certainly hope we can all be friends." And gestured to the purple princess.

"I'm Princess Twilight." She nodded. "Nice to meet you. I think someone has it in for you." She shrugged her wings. "I can see it's all a pack of lies."

"Indeed it is." Anon bowed a bit. "I promise, I would never aggressively harm another." He nodded his head to the side. "Self-defense? That's another story."

"O-Oh, perfectly understandable!" Twilight nodded. "Ah, Rarity, is there anything I can do for you?"

"Not really, Darling." She nodded. "Anon and I have this well in hand. You COULD make us some tea, though. The Fashion Show is tomorrow evening, and we have repairs to do."

"If you don't mind, Princess?" Anon shrugged, wide armed.

"Not at all!" She smiled. "Come on, Fluttershy. Let's help support Rarity and Anon."

It took them all night to repair the damage. However, they noticed, ONE dress was missing entirely. The Decoy Dress. The CRAZY dress. Rarity pointed this out to Twilight.

"We set a trap. Knowing her likelihood to sabotage me, we decided to make something radical. Crazy, even. To push the envelope of fashion - she should have realized that this 'push' is in entirely the wrong direction. Do not fear, Twilight.. come to the Fashion Show. And we will prove her guilt." Rarity smugly smirked. "Now, if you don't mind, we'd like to get a short nap in, before the show commences."

Twilight nodded to her, smiling a bit.

"I know you, Rarity. You've got something devious planned. I'm eager to see what it is!" She smiled. "Come on, Fluttershy."

"I-It was nice to meet you, Mr. Anon." She nodded a bit.

"Just Anon is fine, Fluttershy." He smiled so warmly, it made her blush.

The Princess departed with the yellow one, but they seemed most pleased with Anon and who he was. Rarity smiled at this, knowing that her choice in.. friend-and-maybe-more.. could befriend her dearest friends.

"I am pleased to see you get on so well with my dearest friends." She grinned a bit, and relaxed on the couch.

"I hope I can make friends with them, too." He said, slumping next to her. "Man, that was a lot of work. But.. we did it. Everything's ready."

"Indeed, darling." She levitated the alarm clock over and set it. "Hopefully, five hours will be enough beauty rest."

"For you? You could stay awake forever." He smiled a bit.

She blushed DEEP RED.

"Th-Thank you, Darling." A smile, and she curled up almost in his lap.

Sleep came easily to the two. Sweetie Belle showed up, as urged by her other conspirators, to make DARN SURE no shenanigans happened while the two rested.

At the appointed hour, she nudged them both awake.

"Ahh. Time already!?" He stretched. "Hey, Sweetie Belle!"

"Sister, dear." Rarity yawned.

"Twilight told me what happened.." A little lie. "..so, I snuck over to guard you, and make sure you had food and tea before show time. I also packed up the trunks, everything's ready to go." She smiled, and put a pair of watercress-and-cucumber sandwiches before them, with fresh Black Lightning Tea - the stuff guaranteed to power a rocket ship, or a pony for several hours.

"She let us sleep an extra thirty minutes." He said, digging into his sandwich.

"Thank you so much, Sweetie Belle!" Rarity beamed.

"Awe.. anything for my sister. And the kindly human that helped protect me." She beamed a grin of her own, and for a second, Rarity remembered the happy filly she used to be.

"Don't worry, sis. I even spied on Sterling. She has that crazy dress." She nodded.

Rarity's grin went from pleased, to absolutely dark and devilish, rubbing her hooves together, and chuckling to herself, which turned into a full-on villain laugh. Head thrown back, full chest-and-belly gloating laughter. Anon could almost see the horns grow out on the sides of her head.

And.. it was a bit of a turn-on.

"We're going to have some fun, then." He nodded. "Come on, let's get there."

The travel to the Coxsaddle Community Auditorium was fairly short. Anon pulled the cart with the fashions inside. Sweetie had gotten her mane styled for this, and Rarity had extra supplies on hand to make it fit certain outfits.

The pair had entered every category, so the presentation would be long and arduous. But, they were ready for this. They were ready to absolutely dominate Sterling Bow and her design studio.

In the rear area, they were met by the organizer, Grandly Rich (a cousin of Filthy Rich, someone Rarity once knew). He was an older stallion of about 50 or so, dressed in a fine older-style suit with a stickpinned ascot. His smile was ten miles wide, seeing Rarity enter the building.

"AH! Rarity!" The older man nodded, and nuzzed her briefly. "When I heard you'd entered, I was wondering." He nodded to Anon. "And if it isn't the talk of the town!"

"Sir." Anon nodded respectfully.

"Grandly Rich. I own the auditorium and.. quite a bit more around here!" He chuckled. "I'm the one that puts on this show every year. We're not as big as the Grand Fashion Show of Manehattan, or even some other places, like Paris, but.. we get some attention." He nodded to Rarity. "Shutter Stock and Glamour Wings are BOTH here today." And smiled.

"Both?!" She was surprised, but taken a bit aback as well.

"Indeed! There's a rumor going around that you're about to make some bold moves." He grinned mischeviously. "And I have a five thousand bit wager on it." He nodded.

"Grandly!" She smiled, and clapped her hooves. "Well! If you have faith in me, how CAN I lose?"

"Mmm. Her Royal Highness is here with Miss Fluttershy, too. They're already pressing the hooves. You know how it is. Now, I've got your dressing room set up, and my coltservant over here, Whinnifred Rockley, will ensure there are no irregularities." He led them to the one nearest the pre-stage area.

"Come on, let's get set up." Anon smiled. "We have, as they say in Human Land, the juice." He nodded to the side, a bit, getting the trunks in there with Whinnifred's help.

For his part, Whinnifred was a big, thick stallion. Coltservant, yes, but also a body guard, clearly.

"The Juice?" Sweetie Belle asked.

"Yes. We have the favor of some powerful people that are ensuring we get a fair chance. Of course, this means, we have to do our absolute best, so we don't let them down." He smiled, getting the trunks open, and the dresses on the racks.

"Gotcha!" She nodded firmly. "I'll do my best, Sis, you know that."

"Of course, sister, dear." She nuzzled her. "Thank you, Grandly. After the show, let me know if you'd like to buy one of them.. they might fit your daughter!"

"Hah-ha! Indeed, Rarity! Now, then, I have to go schmooze with these other rich stallions and mares. Good luck!" He departed at that point, and Whinnifred took up a protective position at the door.

The first event. Retro-Modern. This, in human terms would be anything from 1980 to 2000 in fashion, focusing on the mid-late 1980's and early-mid 1990's.

For this, Anon designed an Early 1990's Revival Women's Formal. A three color suit coat, cut femininely but with broad shoulders that hinted at a Zoot Suit's structure, with one lapel in gold-yellow buff, and the other in blue, with the structure of the coat in black. With this, went poofed pants with 1-inch creases in the legs, to add volume. Also black. For shoes, simple flats, in a blue that matches the lapel. The belt is buff and 2-inches tall, with a same-color buckle, to tie the color elements together. On the inside of the under-arm (under-fore-leg) is an "Afro-Jamaican" pattern in a three-inch strip, in buff gold, green, blue, and black.

This is then topped with a large-ish sun hat, with the crown in matching blue, the hatband in black, and the rim two-toned, with the top yellow and the underside black as well.

It looks like they just stepped off the pages of Ebony Magazine.

Given that 'race' isn't a thing, here, Sweetie Belle rocked the outfit. Accessories included a false watch chain that connected to a bitcoin purse, and a broad woven gold necklace. On her foreleg was also a gold watch.

The applause was deafening. Compared to the other fashions, it was clear that this exact style had NOT been done very much in Eqeuestria's past.. but there was a DESIRE for it. New fashion ground indeed.

Sterling's offering was a pastel polo/tennis outfit. Very bougie, very standard, not terribly exciting, but not horrible. More fit for the "Stacy's" of the world.

The second event was Outdoors/Sports. Anything that could be considered a sporty outfit, be it for an actual sport, or just working out.

Anon, again, went with a retro vibe with modern flair. A body suit that could break down. Spandex-cotton blend along the leggings, and a fitting body suit. The leggings detach, though, and the outfit can go from fully sporty to 'casual dining' with the additon of a simple short skirt (that became a skort when added).

Sterling's entry into this category was a fairly standard 'skort-and-top' combo with an additional tank top. The tank top was loose-ish and intended to be 'off-the-shoulder' and flirty. Again, pretty standard.

The third event was Nightwear. Again, this had variations. It could be 'adult wear' or comfy. Most designers went with 'flirty' in some way.

Anon and Rarity's design here was a unisex buildable night suit. Pants that could detach at the groin line to become shorty-shorts, an undershirt that was a soft t-shirt like thing with short sleeves. The overshirt was warm and silky. Last was a proper robe, now showing Anon's trademark "quarter-front" design.

Sterling's entry was a purely flirtatious teddy design that bordered on lewd. It included a thin meshy top, though, with little poofs on it, in red.

Event number four was "casual wear" for mares. Now, Anon's mark was being made.

His design was a two-part break-down dress. The front was quarter-length, as was his trademark. It broke down into a flirty-but-conservative short skirt, and the top of it, once this was detached, became a sun dress. Without it, and with an added waist-length coat, it became a fall outfit.

Sterling's idea of casual wear was a formal looking blouse, a sharp pencil skirt, nylons, and low heels. Casual, maybe, if you're in an office or rich.

"This is going so well, Darling!" Rarity excitedly whispered to Anon.

"They're eating up my quarter-length fronts and transformable clothes." He nodded.

"They ARE! And Sterling.. is doing better than the others, but not as good as us." She nodded.

"I can see that. Ohhh.. I can hardly wait!" He grinned like a Raccoon that just found a trashcan full of barely-expired chicken nuggets.

As it had been 4/5ths of the show already - each event taking quite some time as several designers had outfits to show off - there was a break before the final event. Open Formal.

The capstone to this whole charade.

Anon, Rarity, and Sweetie Belle made their way into the serving room. Several different buffet tables were arranged, as at least one fashion house featured here, were Griffons. Anon was hobnobbing with them.

"Some very interesting ideas, I must say." Said Glenda, the chief designer of Golden Nest, to Anon.

"Quarter-length dresses fit quadrupeds better, is all. And transformable clothing adds both variety and flexibility to an outfit." He shrugged, eating a ham sandwich. "The trick is hiding the transformation parts."

"You're quite good at it." Gerald, her chief tailor, said.

"Eh, my talents were wasted in Humanland." He smirked a bit, showing confidence befitting Rarity's Botique.

"They're utter garbage, is what." Sterling said, sliding up, butting through, and absconding with a slice of Tiramisu. "Transformable? Quarter length? How utterly plebian." She narrowed her eyes at him. "Just you wait until the Open Formal. I have a dress that will absolutely amaze." And sauntered off, with her tail almost tucked between her 'plot' region, twitching with annoyance.

"What an utterly detestable pony." Gerald snorted. "I'm glad you're such a gentlegriff, Anon. It's been a pleasure matching needles with you."

"You're not so bad yourself, Gerald." He nodded. "Maybe next year we'll have a closer competition.." He cocked a brow at the departing Sterling. "..I have a feeling she won't be here.." He said under his breath. "..pardon me." He said aloud, and bowed away.

Rarity and Sweetie Belle were chatting with Twilight and Fluttershy.

"Those Griffons are tough, but fair." He nodded. "Gerlad was telling me they would've had another dress, but mysteriously, a specialized bolt of cloth they needed, went missing."

"Interesting, that, darling." Rarity cocked a brow. "Most of the other houses have reported at least one sabotage."

"It sounds like Sterling is intentionally trying to burn the competition to the ground." Twilight frowned.

"Y-Yes.. but.. we don't have proof." Fluttershy stated, meekly.

"We will. Just you wait." Anon smirked, as did Rarity.

The Open Formal event.

Anon, Rarity, and Sweetie Belle are back stage. Anon is putting some last minute touches on the Baroque Revival.

"It's.. perfect!" He rose and nodded.

"Mister A-Non." Winnifred nodded. "My contact reports that Miss Bow indeed has the dress you mentioned, and is fitting it to her model, now."

"Eeeexcellent.." He wisped his fingers together. "..tell the Stage Manager we'll be delayed, and let her go first. Come on, Rarity."

"Indeed, Mister A-Non, Miss Rarity." He departed.

Meanwhile, Rarity and Anon got to the Designer side of the stage, but in the shadows.

Master of Ceremonies, Loudly Barkler, raised the microphone.

"Mares and Gentlecolts, a slight change-up. House of Bows will be going next. And here we are..!" He motioned to the stage.

The model was INDEED in The Crazy Dress.

"We have here a STUNNING number by House of Bows.. a DARING.. uh.. RADICAL new concept..!" He was looking for good words..

"Now, Rarity!" Anon harshly whispered to her.

With a magical flick, Rarity popped the seams on the dress's skirt section, and 'inflated it,' undoing ALL the pleats PERFECTLY.

THIS DRESS STOLEN FROM RARITY

Was stitched into the very base pattern of the skirt itself, in wild, slashing letters of gaudy coloration that only looked somewhat presentable when the pleats were in.

EVERYONE started gasping and exclaiming in shock.

"I'VE BEEN SABOTAGED!!" Shrieked Sterling Bow, charging over to Rarity. "YOU FILTHY STREETMARE! HOW DARE YOU SABOTAGE MY DRESS LIKE THAT?!"

"Oh, really?" Rarity started in. "What about that bolt of Featherweaven Cloth in your dressing room, darling? The one that can ONLY be obtained from Griffon merchants.. and each Bolt is made to order?" She cocked her head to the side. "I'm sure if Glenda and Gerald inspected it, they'd find it's indeed theirs. Or, perhaps, the missing cherry-scented scarves from Grand Lane Designs? Those are in there, too. I coudl go on, dear, but the truth is.. YOU'RE A THIEF! That dress was stolen from our Boutique last night.. and the theft was CAREFULLY planned - you also have the designs WE intentionally left where you'd find them! Right.. HERE!" She wheeled around and sent her back hooves into Sterling's saddle bags, causing her papers to fly out everywhere.

Fluttershy caught the one with Anon's signature on it.

"A-Ahm.. They're right!" She trotted up, firm faced. "This paper has Anon's signature on it. And Rarity's mark. This is stolen."

"And so's the dress." Twilight said, marching down from the Royal Box with Grandly. "Sterling Bow? You're finished. FLASH!?"

Flash Sentry and another guard with a dark grey coat came out from the side hallway.

"Yes, Princess?" He nodded to her.

"Arrest them. For grand theft." She narrowed her eyes at Sterling.

"I-I-I.. this is a FRAME-UP! This is.. SHE'S LYING!" She pointed at Fluttershy.

"No, I'm not." Fluttershy got cross with her. "And Princess Twilight knows it - I am one of the Elements of Harmony!" She was starting to.. stare intently.. at her.

"Fluttershy..!" Twilight got her attention. "Flash, take her into custody. And her whole crew. She didn't do this alone." She nodded firmly.

Flash Sentry and the other guard escorted them all out, with the two guards being applauded by the fine gentlecolts and mares.

With the situation calmed down, the show proceeded.

The Baroque Revival dress was on next. And when it came out on stage, everyone ooh'd and ahh'd at its fine lines, quarter-length front, and the last second addition of some pearl appointments to the edges of the sleeves and neck.

As with the other Anon-and-Rarity designs, it, too, held a transformation secret - the puffy shoulders detached, could be cinched together, and turned into a hoofbag, leaving an off-the-shoulder number. And the skirt section detached at the midpoint, leaving a thinner back and shorter length, with a slit up one side. The detached skirt part, then, became the hoofbag's rather luxurious matching strap.

Everyone ate this up.

The afterparty was equally magnificent, too. But, Anon and Rarity skipped it, leaving Twilight, Fluttershy, and Sweetie Belle to take the accolades.

THEY.. went home.

"Rarity.." Anon started, as they got in the door.

"Yes, Anon, darling?" She was soft in her tone, too.

"I think I'm in love with you." He just came out with it.

"I think I am, as well.. my darling." She raised up, and embraced him, in a tight hug, that led to a very warm kiss.

And then, out of the shadows, came two mares.

"Hey, Rarity." The pinker one started.

"OH!" She slightly disengaged from Anon. "Glimmer?! Trixie?? What are you two doing here!?"

"Simple, Rares." Trixie smirked. "My mare, here, is the reason Anon showed up." She shrugged.

"..we heard you in the Jazz Bar.." Glimmer started. "..I couldn't.. I heard you singing and.." She lowered her head. "Look, I-I know we're not best friends or anything, but.." She frowned. "I couldn't stand to see you so unhappy." She shrugged. "So.. I cast a spell designed to bring you True Love. I.. I admit I had no idea what it'd do, or if it'd work.. but.."

"Glimmer.. thank you." She disengaged from Anon fully, and went over and hugged her. "True love? Oh, yes, Darling, I have found it. I think Anon and I will be a very happy couple."

"I know I will be." Anon nodded. "I'm dating the prettiest mare in the world." He smirked.

"Thank you, My Darling." She slid back over to him. "For now, Glimmer, please.. thank you so very much for what you've done for me." She nodded. "But.. we'd.. like to get to bed." She shrugged.

"OH! Right, you two must be exhausted!" She blinked.

"..yes, exhausted.." She very vulgarly grabbed Anon by the belt and DRAGGED him. "..see you two later! We'll have tea some time!"

And so, Anon met Rarity, courted Rarity, and fell in love with Rarity. In return, she fell in love with him. Together, they outed a thief and ran away with the local fashion show, sending Hosue of Bows into the dustbin of history.

Together, they would make the most gorgeous fashions and designs together.. both in the bedroom, and in the studio!

Marriage? Of course! But, that's a tale for another time.

THE END!
