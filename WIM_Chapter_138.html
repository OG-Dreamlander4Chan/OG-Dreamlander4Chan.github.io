Part 1: Ascention

TIME: 13:57 EET
DATE: War Day 1040/8 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Holy Monastery of the Solarum, Thessaly, Principality of Vulpesylvania


By late in the day, we had arrived at Mount Olympus. More precisely, we arrived at the foot of the mountain, at a Monastery dedicated to Celestia and Luna. We were immediately invited in as her Acolytes.

Only problem I had, was, all the Monks here had taken vows of silence.

Applejack: "..kinda creepy, here, hun." She hushed very quietly to me.

K: "They can hear you, honey." I nodded. "You may not think they can, but they can. They're surrounded by silence. The slightest noise, to them, can be easily picked up."

Rarity: "I am pleased, though, that they were so ready to help us." She smiled.

They'd fed us. Dates, olives, oats, and milk. It was plain, but it was filling, and better than rations. We had to make our own tea. While they did not object, one of the Brothers made it clear that they do not consume either Tea or Coffee.

Yeah, we didn't even know their names.

Sunset: "Heh-heh-heh.. ahh.." She smiled. "I'm still psyched that we're literally Power Rangers."

K: "Don't expect us to need to do that again." I shrugged, munching my milk-sopped oats and dates.

Fluttershy: "E-Even if we don't.." She smiled a bit. "..it was very comforting to know that we could." She blushed a bit. "I've never felt so confident before."

K: "Oh, you've come a very long way, Fluttershy. Remember when you found me in the tree?" I smirked, and patted her shoulder. "I'm still sorry I made you cry."

Fluttershy: "It's okay." She one-wing hugged me. "I wasn't as confident in myself back then. And a lot more sensitive."

Rainbow Dash: "Yeah, you've come a looooooong way since the Junior Flyers." She smiled.

Toola Roola: "We've all changed. A lot." She shrugged. "I mean, Sunset and I wouldn't even be here if things had just.. gone the way they would've without the war."

Rarity: "Indeed, darlings. And now, at least MOST of us.. are either wed or betrothed or.." She glared at Fluttershy.

Fluttershy: "Eeep!" She ducked down, but in jest, smiling like a little munchkin as she did. "I'm just waiting for Golden to ask, is all." She raised up, and gave a confident smile.

Then.. ALL THE MARES stared at me. Even the Brother that served us. And HE had a look of "Thou must'n't breaketh yon Bro Code."

I blinked a few times.

K: "Okay, okay, I'll talk to him." I shrugged with a smile.

We finished our meal, and thanked the Brothers of the Order. From here on, we'd have to climb on foot.. er, hoof.

The trip was going to take a bit. At least a couple of hours. Possibly longer. I had no idea if there was a portal or something..? Waiting for us?

No matter. Most of the route up was a path and was marked. After we travelled for about an hour, the trail would come to an end, and we'd be forced to trek through terrain. The trail itself was steep and winding.

After almost an hour...

Sunset: "..Kay, now where?" She nodded to me.

K: "Straight ahead." I pointed. "The peak is over there."

Rarity: "It shall take us a bit, darlings." She tapped her back hoofshoes on a rock, kicking off a few loose stones.

Applejack: "Ah'm hopin' this'll be easy." She shrugged. "After that faight with Squirk'n'all.."

Toola Roola: "Oh, AJ! Don't be silly! Nothing's ever EASY.." She shrugged a bit.

Fluttershy: "..oh! K!" She pointed off to the left, suddenly. "Look over there!"

Sure enough, I could see a bird that seemed to be stuck in a bush.

..oh, y-

K: "Defensive formation, let's go help." I immediately knew what was going on here, but I let it play, and I didn't think too hard about it.

Rarity: "..I should ask if that's wise, but.." She put a hoof to my hip. "..coming from you, darling? I know it is." She smirked, and strutted away.

We moved over, and formed a small semi-circle around Fluttershy as she helped the bird out of the bit of netting that had gotten entangled in the bush.

Fluttershy: "THERE you go. Poor little thing." She put a tiny bandage on its tiny leg, and gave it a kiss on the head. "Be careful!" And fed it some seed, before letting it go.

K: "We good?" I nodded to her.

Fluttershy: "He's fine, now." She nodded back.

K: "Let's move." I motioned.

Another few hundred yards ahead, and at the end of the trail. Or, more precisely, where the trail branched off and led to another town. We'd be going into unmarked territory from here.

Lo' and behold, down the trail the other way about 500 meters, there was a large boulder blocking the way. And I could see an old tod (that's a male fox) pulling a cart, there.

K: "..let's go help him." I nodded.

Sunset: "Oh..kay.." She blinked, shrugged, and led the way. "I'm trusting you."

K: "As well you should. The Gods and Goddesses are watching us." I nodded, as I fell in behind her.

We got down to where the old tod was, and he was sitting next to his cart, gently smoking his pipe.

K: "Need some help, sir?" I nodded to him.

Old Tod: "Yes, young fella! I can't get to town-"

I held my hands up, and offered him my canteen.

K: "Say no more." I side-nodded to the boulder. "Need some rock removal?"

Old Tod: "Oh, yes! Oh-! Thank you, kind sir!" He drank the entire thing. "Been most of the day I've been stuck here."

K: "AJ? Detcord and some Comp-B." I pointed.

Applejack: "Yew got it, hun." She nodded, and got out her demolitions kit.

Old Tod: "Oh, my! Fireworks." He blinked.

K: "Yeah, if we just roll the boulder down the mountain, it could keep going and hit someone. Better we shatter it into smaller, less dangerous pieces, and move it out of the way as a pile. On the plus side, some of the stones should be the right side for house building." I nodded with a grin.

Old Tod: "Oh! Huh. Hadn't thought of that." He nodded.

Toola Roola: "Want a granola bar, sir? While we wait." She nodded to him, offering.

Old Tod: "Oh, thank you, young lady!" He gratefully took the offered granola bar and ate it as slow as his gapped teeth allowed him.

It took Applejack a good 10 minutes to rig up the demo charge. The others pulled security. Fluttershy made sure the Old Tod wasn't any worse for wear.

Applejack: "Ready here, hun." She grinned, and ushured everyone behind the bend, so we'd be in cover. "Plug yer ears." She nodded.

K: "CLEAR! CLEAR! FIRE IN THE HOLE!" I called out.

Jackie pulled the lever on the piezolectric detonator and sent a charge through the line, that caused the assembled explosives to detonate. Sure enough, the rock was shattered into smaller bits.

K: "Shovels and picks." I nodded, pulling mine out. "Clear a path."

This took us about another half hour. Sweaty, sweaty work. I knew a few stallions that WOULD NOT MIND seeing their Mares so worked up like this.

Rarity: *Phew!* "Shower after this, darling. I'm positively filthy!" She smirked, though.

Sunset: "No kidding." She frowned. "Eh, magic helps some."

K: "Road's clear, sir." I nodded to him. "Be careful."

Old Tod: "Thank you, young people!" He bowed to us.

K: "Any time, sir." I gave him a big grin. "Let's get moving." I motioned to my team.

Another.. ohh... twenty or so minutes later, a rather fetching mare in a light red coat, with blonde locks of gold, and a fine rump, came trotting up.

Mare: "Oh! Travelers!" She bowed to us, and immediately fluttered her eyes at me. "Care to take a rest? I have wine-"

K: "I'm getting sick of this, Aphrodite." I glared at her. "Wrong form, too." I shrugged, booping her snootle. "Should've gone with a human."

Everyone stopped.

Everything went still.

Aphrodite: "OKAY! Okay, fine." She shrugged her shoulders. "Look, for what it's worth, I didn't think this would work. YOUUUUU seem to know us, Human." She snorted.

Applejack: "..wuz she tryin'-" She looked at Aphrodite. "Jes' no. Goddess're not, ya ain't gettin' mah husband."

Aphrodite: "Oh, REALLLY!?" She was challenged! Aphrodite gave me the once-over, and transformed herself into some Venice Beach bleached blonde bimbo bodied babe.

I stood there and blinked at her, my face lacking any emotion.

K: "I'm married to two." I shrugged at her. "Both my human wife, J-- and Applejack. You can't tempt me."

She slid over and went to grope, but Applejack PULLED THE SWORD OF RAINBOW'S LIGHT FROM IT'S SHEATH AND POINTED IT AT HER.

Applejack: "YEW BACK UP THAT WAGON, SISTER! OR AI'M'AH SHOW YEW WHUT HE DONE TAUGHT ME 'BOUT NAILIN' GODS TA STICKS!" She bellowed.

Aphrodite: "Oh, my-"

K: "Zero out of ten. Unrealistic beauty standard. You have the dimensions of a Barbie Doll, and the personality of same." I shrugged. "Now, are you Gods and Goddesses going to quit SCREWING AROUND with us?" I looked back behind us. "The Old Tod, the stuck bird.. really." I looked back at her. "Take US to see Zeus." I held out Poseidon's gift.

Aphrodite: "OH!" She smiled.. paused.. then laughed/cackled seeing AJ still had her hackles up. "I surrender, young mare. I won't try anything with your husband." She waved her hands, and assumed her normal form.. which was a slightly more realistic version of what she'd transformed into. "Alright, alright. Come with me."

She summoned up a gold-ringed portal, and gestured to it.

K: "No tricks, or my wife will see your beating heart." I gave her a small glare.

Aphrodite: "You REALLY know us, don't you?" She giggled. "No tricks. I PROMISE." She crossed her heart over her chest.

K: "And even Gods and Goddesses must hold to promises. Let's go, gang." I motioned for us to follow her, after gingerly relieving my wife of my sword.

The things we seem to get ourselves into.

Part 2: Of Gods and Mares

TIME: Meaningless
DATE: War Day 1040/8 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: The Mystical Realm of the Vulpine Gods, Olympus


We appeared in a very, very large auditorium-like area, with thrones, massive tables, and all sorts of statues all over the place. Gods and Goddesses were milling about, chatting with each other, and doing all manner of magics.

Dionysus: "HUMAN!!" He about tackled me to the ground.

K: "GAH! Careful! Mortal!" I tapped his arms. "That's too tight, my man!"

Dionysus: "Oh, sorry, sorry!" He patted my shoulders. "Come here, come here!" He dragged me by the wrist, over to the food table. "Let's see... you like.. Double Quarter Pounder, No Cheese, Extra Seasoning, Extra Ketchup." He nodded, and made McDonald's appear on the table. "And fries in cow lard." He nodded again, grinning. "AND! Doctor Pepper!"

Indeed, my McD's order was right there on the table.

I blinked as the girls came over.

And I grabbed the fithy, chemically, fatty bun and wolfed down on it like I hadn't seen food in five years. It was PERFECT.

Fluttershy: "..that doesn't look too healthy." Her 'disappointment' voice.

Dionysus: "It's not! It's 50% Chemicals! But, eh. He hasn't had it in a while. Why not let him enjoy it?" He beamed a grin, and produced from behind his back a Mochi dish - entirely vegan, made of flavored Mochi. Shaped like Angel. "You know, your dear bunny has asked about you?"

Fluttershy: "Wh-" She sniffled. "ANGEL!?"

He bounced from behind a huge Turkey, and leapt into her arms. Hugging her.

Applejack: "ANGEL!"

Rarity: "OH MY STARS!"

Rainbow Dash: "HEY! ANGEL!"

Angel waved at all of us, accepting hugs from all the girls.

Fluttershy: "I don't understand! How-" Angel pulled her ear close to talk to her.

K: "Angel." I said, finally, after wolfing down the burger. "I.. I can't thank you enough, man. Y-"

He jumped into MY arms, and hugged me.

Fluttershy: "A-Angel.. said.. thank you for looking after me." She sniffled.

K: "We bros, now?" I held up my fist for a fist bump, and he bumped it. "We bros."

Applejack: "How'd'ya end up here?" She tilted her head.

Ares: "THAT.. was my doing." He stepped forwards, and held his hand out to me.

I knew to grab him at the forearm inwards, not at the hand.

Ares: "You are a fine warrior, and you have made so many more." He nodded. "Angel sacrificed his life to save the world. He DESERVES a place here!" He nodded firmly.

I should point out, he looks like the late Kevin Smith. Yes, the Ares from Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, starring Kevin Sorbo.

K: "So.. I mean.. the party is nice and all-"

Zeus: "I'M the reason you're here." He stepped forwards with his wife, Hera, hanging on his arm.

K: "..you two must be going through a make-up period."

The Gods and Goddesses laughed.. like, legitimately laughed.

Hades: "Brother was right - he's CHEEKY!" He chortled.

Zeus: "He is, at that." He nodded.

Hera: "Never doubt that I love Zeus." She smiled at me and Applejack. "There's a happy home if I ever saw one." And petted Applejack on the head.

Applejack: "Well, gosh, howdy, ma'am!" She beamed a grin. "I shure try!"

Hera: "You will be blessed well as a mother." She smiled.

Zeus: "So, human. YOU.. need my lightning." He nodded. "A fair deal. If you do not stop Tirek, he will soon gain the powers of a Godkiller." He shrugged. "That.. IS among his intentions."

Ares: "Indeed." He nodded. "PART of his goal is to kill ALL Primordals and absorb as much of our power as he can."

K: "Which would make him literally unstoppable." I shrugged. "Can't have that."

Zeus: "Indeed. So, each of us must give you a little something to help you on your quest." He gestured. "As with all things involving Mortals, we cannot intervene directly too much."

K: "Universal rules. And the threat that if you do, the Mortals will cease doing for themselves, and instead of being Worshipped, you're instead made into Servants." I gestured.

I noted Rarity was chatting with Aphrodite, despite AJ's very clear dislike of the Goddess.

Zeus: "A smart one, he is." He nodded. "Hephaestus!"

Hepheastus came forwards, in his expected limp. Me? I went right over and hugged him like a lost brother. He.. hesitantly.. patted me on the back.

K: "You got a raw deal in a lot of ways, man." I nodded to Aphrodite. "Best looking wife of the lot, but still, everyone should have a chance to be accepted for who they are."

Hephaestus: "..no one's ever really said that to me before." He blinked.

Rarity: "OF COURSE, darling! Everyone needs friends! And friendship is MAGIC." She beamed a grin.

Sunset: "Yeah." She hugged Hephaestus' arm. "I know what it's like being an outcast and barely accepted until someone awesome came along and gave ME a chance." She looked at me.

Hephaestus was moved to tears, smiling, and embracing ALL OF US.

Hephaestus: "Even though you're only mortals.. I'm glad to have friends." He smiled at Zeus.

Zeus: "I told you." He nodded. "They wouldn't just respect your skill. The human, especially. He has a strong heart."

Hephaestus: "You did." He nodded, and pulled back. He then produced a golden lightning bolt from his pocket, and took the Sword of Rainbow's Light, moving over to an anvil. "I shall imbue your sword." He nodded. "The Feather of Icarus was sacrificed to us days ago.. Queen Novo knew that only my skill could imbue the sword properly." He started hammering, carefully.

Zeus: "After this, you will have my Lightning, and the power of true Flight." He nodded to me. "Use it wisely."

K: "I will be certain to." I nodded back to him. "You all know. I will die for this place." I bowed my head a bit. "There is so much here that's good and pure. I want to defend it, more than anything else in my life. No matter the cost." I shrugged.

Apollo: "We know." He patted my shoulder. "We also know that you're probably the only one who could've done what you've done. You STARTED all of this." He smiled. "Without you, these ponies would have been almost defenseless."

Sunset: "ALMOST!" She smiled. "Not totally." And shrugged her wings.

Hades: "In.. addition to my brother's gift." He handed me a small piece of yellow diamond. "Give this to your Dragon friend. So he can Summon me." He smirked. "You may need me."

K: "I will." I nodded, accepting it. "I'm glad to see you're united in this cause."

Hera: "We have our.. disagreements at times." She smiled. "However, when it comes to the fate of all the world, we stand united." And shrugged a bit. "At least for our own survival."

Toola Roola: "This is really wild." She beamed a grin. "I never thought I'd get to see anything like this."

Apollo: "This isn't even the end." He nodded.

Athena: "Other Primordals will reach out to you." She addressed me. "And offer their assistance." She nodded. "You'll need it."

K: "Of course." I nodded deeply to her.

Hephaestus: "It is finished." He held up the sword.

Indeed, the sword had taken on a golden glint on the edges of the blade and the center ridge. The grip was a bit longer, now, and better suited to a proper hand-and-a-half grip. And when I held it, it seemed to overflow with newfound strength.

Zeus: "Now, then. You've an invasion to counter." He nodded to me. "We wish you luck."

K: "Thank you, Lord Zeus." I bowed slightly to him.

With a brush of his hand, we were sent away from the realm of the Gods in a foggy cloud of air. Like a breath of warmth, we found ourselves sent down the mountain. The girls were giddy.

I was still amazed.

The Old Gods had granted us favor.

I would be sure to earn this with every action I made. Just like the old days, when some would appeal to them for favor and assistance, I would not squander it.

After all, everyone was counting on us.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Pandemonium

TIME: 14:22 EET
DATE: War Day 1040/8 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: Pandeleimon, Thessaly, Principality of Vulpesylvania


We appeared on the beach.

K: "Well, that was something." I shrugged.

Applejack: "WHOA!" She smiled. "We sure were somewhere!"

Sunset: "Ahh.. Kay?" She suddenly turned towards me.

Toola Roola: "LOOOOOOOOK!" She yelled out.

Rainbow Dash: "OH CELESTIA!" She shouted.

I looked towards the sea. Landing craft. Just as I'd feared. Dozens of them, being lowered from the decks of several large warships. I picked out at least two Ocean-Going Monitors, four Battleships, four Heavy Cruisers, six Light Cruisers, and eight Destroyers.

Rarity: "Darlings, I think we're in trouble." She snorted.

K: C> "Alpha Actual to ANY NEIGHTO CALL SIGN! Condition RED! ANYONE RESPOND!"

We had perhaps five minutes.

Sherby: C> "This is Alpha Two-Niner! Heyyy, buddy! We're on our way!"

K: C> "SHERBY! You don't even know where we ARE!"

Sherby: C> "Of course I do! There's a Scout Plane watching you from your north-north west!"

We turned to look, and sure enough, a Vulpesylvanian Air Force Scout Plane was watching the area.

K: C> "We.. ah.. we got something for this?"

Sherby: C> "We sure do! Get off the beach - you're in a Free Fire Zone."

K: "LET'S GO!" I motioned, and we all took off for the tree line behind us.

Capt. Prime Alexei Kronos: "GENERAL! OVER HERE!" Came the call from the tree line.

We slid in to the defensive fortifcations, and a Melanized Fox (that is, one with large dark patches) leaned over and shook hand-and-paw with me.

Capt. Kronos: "Captain Prime Alexei Kronos, 2nd Infantry Regiment." He nodded. "There's a pair of Helicopters waiting for you, sir."

K: "Helicopters?" I tilted my head.

Capt. Kronos: "The Goddess Athena told us you would arrive here. We have the beach, sir, we need your expertise on the sea." He shrugged.

K: "Got it." I nodded. "Alright, let's go, girls." I motioned.

Rarity: "Seems we're expected." She smirked.

Toola Roola: "So was the invasion - wow." She motioned to the defense-in-depth fortifications and positions as we mae our way to the rear.

Rainbow Dash: "Anchored by the castle. Look." She was in the air by about 3 meters, and pointed to the huge Byzantine-style castle in the distance about 500 meters from us.

Bright Eyes: "COME ON, K!" She shouted from where the helicopters were.

The other pilot..

K: "SOARIN!" I ran over to his helicopter, and leaned in and hugged him.

Soarin': "Hey, K!" He hugged back. "Later, later. For now, get on board!"

Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Sunset got in with me. Fluttershy, Toola, and Rarity took the other chopper.

K: "AM I glad to see you!" I said, getting my headset on.

Soarin': "Same here, K. I-I'm alright. I promise." He nodded.

It had been so long since his husband, Braeburn, died. And on top of that, the ship named for Braeburn had been sunk in its first battle. A double blow to a stallion so brave, that he'd been up and fighting since the first Attack on Canterlot so long ago. He had fallen into a dark place. A very dark place. But, it seemed, he was back.

I couldn't be happier. He was family.

We flew out along the beach, just as the enemy infantry forces were starting to get close. We took a sharp turn out to sea, and I could see an assembled fleet.

Thermopylae (flying a very familiar Pirate flag), Marathon, Naxos, Andros, Argolis, Salonica, Athens, Argos, Rhodes, Kos, Patomos. Ablemarle (flying Sargasso's flag), Maine, Augusty, Reinleigh, Brazier, Bellicose, Dee Dovely, and Corner Sharpe.

This gave me two "light" battleships, two medium cruisers, two Heavy Cruisers, four Light Cruisers, five Destroyers, and five Frigates.

Not enough to face the enemy fleet and expect to win, but enough to make a fight of it.

We were set down on Thermopylae's forward turret, one helicopter at a time. I slid down the sides, and ran for the conning tower. Climbing the steps inside, I got to the bridge.

Sherby: "We're ready, K." He smirked. "And we only have to hold them off for a little bit." He leaned left and right, cheekily balancing on his peg leg. "We have a surprise."

K: "Oh? What's the surprise?" I shrugged.

Sherby: "The Germane Fleet is arriving." He nodded. "One Battleship, two Heavies, two Lights, and four DD's."

K: "That'll even the odds." I nodded slowly. "Let's go disrupt the landing, then!" I looked to the forward part of the bridge. "All ahead full, course zero-niner-seven. Let's get at angle to them, and give them all of our guns. Destroyers, prepare for deep strike. Torpedoes at the ready. Frigates, prepare to attack the enemy landing craft. Air forces, strafe the beaches."

Sherby: "YOU HEARD THE MAN!" He nodded.

K: "Try and stay out of the line of fire of those big battleships." I nodded.

As my orders were relayed, I saw my fleet swing into action. Gunfire erupted from our side, just as the enemy fleet became aware of our bearing and direction. We got in the first few hits, but troublingly, didn't seem to do very much damage. These ships were built for punishment.

The enemy Monitors broke free of landing duties, first, and with only a destroyer's escort each, made steam for the Thermopylae and Marathon, looking to engage in a duel.

Unless the enemy was STUPID, they already knew they had an advantage of some kind.

K: "Dance with those Monitors. I want to see what they plan to do." I nodded.

Capt. Cerra Xythos: "General, those monitors.. they used to be battleships." He nodded. "They built those as a direct counter to THIS class."

K: "Mm." I nodded. "Small hullform, low freeboard, fat beam.. sure to be armored well." I twitched my lips. "Cross their T. Course zero-eight-zero. Try to get a line on their superstructure or their turrets."

Capt. Xythos: "Aye."

We did just that. As I suspected, the ship was armored proofed against our ten inch guns. I saw two shells hit the deck, explode, and do no appreciable damage. One shell deflected off of the turret of the first Monitor. Another hit below the bridge, detonated, and resulted in only a major dent.

Return fire from the lead Monitor hit us amidships.

Sherby: "Our five-incher just got blown off!" He shouted. "Minor damage to the Boat Deck. One shell pierced above the belt, minor internal damage."

K: "We can't take any more punishment from those things." I nodded. "Break off - both Battleships, get us back to our fleet. Signal Ablemarle to come in and give us some cover fire."

We were able to do THAT smartly, but our speed and theirs were identical. They kept pace with us. When our Heavy Cruisers arrived, so did theirs, and another exchange of gunfire erupted at about 7km range. We couldn't shake them.

K: "They suckered us into this." I frowned. "Match indeed. They must've had some good intel to match the basic ability of the Thermopylae class so well."

Sherby: "Ablemarle reports moderate damage. The hangar deck is holed, but the munitions and avgas were secured. Maine reports significant superstructure damage and casualties, no impact on fighting ability. Small fires, but they have it under control. Destroyers report little success on the enemy heavy units. One enemy Destroyer hit, broke their back. The enemy vessels seem to have thickly plated torpedo belts." He shrugged. "And without the Hermes and Mount Athos, we can't really use strike aircraft."

K: "Time until the Germanes get here?" I nodded to him.

Sherby: "They said they'd be in gun range in-"

Lookout: "TO THE SOUTH! MASSIVE WARSHIP APPROACHING!"

K: "Oh, now wh-" I stepped off to the side of the flying bridge and had a look. The ship was gigantic.. what had Tirek-

Adm. Kaltbluter: C> "Eisen Actual to Alpha Actual."

K: "No way." I blinked, and reached for the comm set. C> "Alpha Actual, go Eisen."

Adm. Kaltbluter: C> "Stand back, old friend. Let Harnisse-Rhine and her Surface Action Group handle these rabble. Fall back. We make defensive line."

K: C> "Eisen - we're stuck in a one-to-one chase with the enemy Monitors, we can't shake them."

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Zhen.. get a raincoat." He said that last line with absolute dark ferocity.

Moments later, I saw the GIGANTIC BATTLESHIP open up with 14 main guns.

The shells were fast. Rocket assisted.

They slammed into the first Monitor and one of the Heavy Cruisers next to it, that was trying to bully Ablemarle.

The explosions from the massive shells detonated the Monitor and shoved the entire hull so far under water, hydrostatic pressure wasn't enough to bring it back up. It evaporated with all hands. The Heavy Cruiser fared little better, with massive impacts to its fore and aft magazines, AND the boiler room. Magazine detonations were instant, such was the force of the shells. This shattered the cruiser into pieces, and forced the open gaping wound at its boiler room under water, causing cold sea water to hit the hot boilers.. and thermal expansion caused another massive detonation.

Two ships. Each hit five times out of 14 shots. Both gone instantly with all hands.

The enemy fleet saw this, and immediately paused. They were trying to figure out what to do when six Strike Fighters came overhead and strafed their flagship, dropping small bombs right on the bridge. The Flagship was targeted for literal assassination, and it worked. The enemy fleet was in chaos.

Almost immediately, individual units broke and ran, as the Harnisse-Rhine reloaded. The next volley targeted the former flagship. A modern battleship in every regard, the plunging fire from the rocket assisted projectiles penetrated DEEP into its hull, causing blowouts and severe damage as the secondary battery magazines detonated. She immediately began to list. One shell pierced the smokestack, hit the base of the conning tower in the rear, and detonated there, causing the conning tower to partially cave in, to the rear. Its maximum speed was hobbled severely.

The remaining enemy vessels escaped to the north and east at maximum speed, abandoning their landing attempt, and any troops in the water. The strike fighters immediately retasked and started strafing the beaches, and the landing craft, sinking several. The Germane heavy cruisers got to us at this point, and started engaging the landing craft in the water with main guns. Their own strike fighters were armed with 75mm rockets, and they used those to good effect, peppering the remaining landers.

In just a few short minutes, it was over. By the time we made it back to the Germane flagship to lick our wounds, the battle was decided. I was out on deck in the tiny Coastal Defense Battleship, looking up at this gigantic monster of a battleship.

Admiral Kaltbluter smiled and waved from the bridge. About 25 meters up in the air from where I was. Or, 82 feet.

At last.. WE HAD THE BIGGER STICK, FOR ONCE!

Adm. Kaltbluter: "K. Mein herr." He nodded to me as I came aboard. "Vee heff heard you lost your battleship und carrier." He shrugged a bit. "I offer you Harnisse-Rhine as your flagship, mein freund."

K: "Thank you, Admiral." I smiled. "Full Admiral, now, I see, too."

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Prince Hoffnungsteyer thinks it is best I command the whole of the Navy." He shrugged. "I heff also brought ein brigade of Marinekampftruppe."

K: "We'll need them." I nodded. "It's good you showed. The enemy was landing at least a full Brigade there. The defending Militia and proper Army were only about a battalion and a Regiment or so." I shrugged.

Rarity: "Admiral." She bowed slightly. "May a lady beg ever so humbly for a nice shower?"

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Jahwol, Fraulei-"

K: "Frau." I corrected, smiling.

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Oh! Hahahah! FRAU Rarity." He bowed like a gentlecolt. "You shall heff to introduce zee lucky stallion whomst caught zee eye of such fine a lady." And smiled.

Rarity: "Oh, of COURSE, darling!" She smiled, sweetly. "Come on, girls. Time to clean up." She nudged them all along from behind.

K: "I could use a rest and cleaning myself. We've been going since yesterday and we've had a few big fights." I shrugged. "This is Rainbow McSherbet." I gestured to Sherby. "He's my Naval Special Operations Advisor."

Sherby: "I am the Pirate McSherbet." He bowed to Admiral Kaltbluter. "An honor, Admiral Kaltbluter."

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Ja!" He nodded firmly, and bowed a bit himself. "An honor. Vee heff heard of your exploits even in Germaneigh. You are a stallion vorth respekt."

Sherby: "Well, now I work for the ultimate good guys." He smiled broadly.

K: "He's good." I nodded. "Damn smart, crafty, knows what he's doing. And friendly."

Adm. Kaltbluter: "A fine ally." He clapped a hoof on Sherby's shoulder.

K: "How's your son?" I smiled a bit.

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Seigfried ist vell." He smiled back. "Him being in our lifes hast.. rekindled somesing in my marirage, Herr K." He lowered his head a bit. "I thank you."

K: "I did nothing." I shrugged.

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Shtill." He shrugged. "Mein wife hast gone home to raise him. Our former fleet now guards our shores, und she commands." He nodded firmly.

K: "Glad to hear." I smiled. "So. What all did you bring?" I nodded.

Adm. Kaltbluter: "First Surface Action Group, und First Carrier Combat Group." He nodded, and brought me over to the combat information center - which, here, was the back part of the main bridge in a huge (and very thickly armored) command center. "Each Surface Action Group, or Oberflächenaktionsgruppe contains one super battleship, three heavy cruisers, und six destroyers. Each Flugzeugträgerkampfgruppe contains one aircraft carrier, four light cruisers, und four Frigatten." He nodded.

K: "That's quite the force." I nodded back. "Just these two action groups has put us back on more than even footing. I didn't see any anti air ability on those ships. Your Carrier will have good hunting." I shrugged.

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Gut. Zo. Orders?" He nodded with a grin.

K: "For the time being, I want the shoreline of Vulpesylvania secured. Are the Roamans taking the other side?" I nodded.

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Ja." He nodded back. "Admiral Tortellini hast zee Roaman Navy arriving along Vulpe's western shores."

K: "Good. Secure the main coast up to Vulpe's international maritime boundary. Be aggressive. Chase the enemy fleet out of these waters, then use strike aircraft or long range bombardment to damage their port facilities and make further sea sorties impossible on a large scale. Land Marines on Thassos, Imbros, and Samothráki to secure them and deny them to the enemy. We'll take a detachment of the Inner Islands Defense Fleet towards Límnos and the other minor islands along the eastern sea flank. I'll have some of CAG with me for that, and some Equestrian Marines." I nodded.

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Zee main war ist on zee land." He nodded.

K: "Indeed. We're trying to free up as much space and troops as possible, so the Vulpes can counter the main enemy army with their best forces. Once we push them back towards the pre-attack borders, we'll see if they're interested in talking. If not, we'll see if the Vulpes want to get aggressive and reclaim their lost territories from previous conflicts." I shrugged.

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Zhen.. zis might be our first truly OFFENSIVE action, ja?" He smiled a bit.

K: "It very well might." I nodded. "Until now, we've only acted in defense of existing territory, or as raiders. We've never intentionally attacked the territory of an enemy nation with the intent of keeping the land." I shrugged. "But, the Vulpes lost the Argeios Territories a long time ago. They want them back. Macedonkians were largely responsible for their loss."

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Zo.. how would zis be solved in Human's Land?" He tilted his head.

K: "Reconquista. But, only if the Vulpes really want it. See, thing is, those lands were Vulpinian, originally. After a generation, it's generally considered that the loser in the conflict that traded territories, loses most rights to reclaim them. However, if the same nation attacks again, that original losing nation can take the chance to get some of those lost territories back." I shrugged and gestured at the map. "Macedonkia has declared war on Vulpesylvania, that much is clear. Vulpesylvania, being part of NEIGHTO, has every right to ask for NEIGHTO's help. They did, and I asked you all for direct support. Now, if the Vulpes want their lost territory back, things get a little politically touchy. I don't know if Roam and Prince Hoffnungsteyer want to be party to a reconquest that didn't happen under Tirek's orders. For that matter, I don't know if Celly.. uh.. Princess Celestia.. does, either."

He gave me a cocked brow look of disapproval, at calling Celestia, "Celly."

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Und if NEIGHTO does not?" He nodded to me, head tilted slightly to the side.

K: "It's within their right to refuse to participate in offensive operations. I see the Vulpes argument that the land was theirs, and from what I know, a lot of Vulpes still live there. Many more were generationally disposessed of land and wealth. Macedonkia has to pay some kind of price for its aggression. This is the first time something like this has happened - even the incidents with Orghuz, the Herdiets, and the Khyangese, weren't outright declarations of war by a sovereign state. They were.. unsanctioned skirmishes." I shrugged.

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Zo.. what vill ve do?" He gestured.

K: "For the moment, we have a responsibility under the NEIGHTO Charter to repel the invasion and restore the pre-conflict border. So, we're acting under full agreed authorization for you to carry out my orders. Denying the enemy's ability to wage war by disabling their port facilites is a legitimate war goal, no matter what." I nodded to him.

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Agreed. Ast I have full authority of all Germane troops, I agree completely. Vhen ve remove zis rabble from ze lands of our friends, we see where we are, then." He nodded smartly.

K: "Aright, then, if it's okay with you, I'm going to go get a shower and a clean uniform." I gave him a sharp nod.

Adm. Kaltbluter: "Jahwol." He nodded with a smile.

With that, I was off. And in the VIP Quarters.. Applejack was waiting for me. I was simply dragged into the shower and forcibly cleaned.

Then we got dirty.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Wipe Out

TIME: 08:15 EET
DATE: War Day 1041/8 Secundus, 1005 C.S.
LOCATION: VMS Thermopylae, Offshore of Limnos, Principality of Vulpesylvania


The official declaration of war had arrived on the evening of the day after the strike on Athens. We were at war with Tarpangoslavia, Macedonkia, and Shquiptaria. The offical delcaration stated that Macedonkia wanted the rest of what they referred to as their ancient lands, and the subdjugation of Vulpesylvania as a vassal of Macedonkia or a member of the Herdintern Non-Aligned Movement.

This is also when we learned that Shquiptaria had recently undergone a revolution, and counter to our previous information, was now the Shquiptar Herdiet Democratic Republic. This was an interesting development to say the least. It meant that their former royal family had been overthrown.. but were they still alive? I had a feeling this would be important.

One of my favorite Power Couples was also here - Vigilance and Colgate. Vigilance was now a Warrant Officer, ever since Grylan, and technically would command his own unit in the Rangers, if he and Colgate hadn't been moved over to CAG.

Vigilance: "You know, K.." He smirked. "..every time I get near you, I get hurt."

Colgate: "Mhm." She polished the end of her Knox. "That's why you have me, big guy." She then gently thumped his flank with her hoof.

K: "Either way, I'm glad to have you two along. You're Veterans. These Fox Marines, aren't." I shrugged.

Signifier Sergeant Whispering Grove: "Sirs." She paced up. One of the more technicolor foxen, she was dark blue coated, with white 'fox gloves' on her front paws. "My platoon is all ready."

K: "Your platoon will come ashore with us. If anything's hinky, the rest of the company lands." I nodded. "Tell Captain Silverfish I'd like to talk to him."

SfSgt. Whispering Grove: "Aye, sir." Off she paced.

Vigilance: "I like these foxes." He smiled. "The land is beautiful, the folks are nice.." He looked at Colgate. "The three of us should get a vacation here, after the war." And smiled with his lids half shut.

Colgate: "Mhmm. YOU just want more foals." She smirked back, but leaned in a bit.

Vigilance: "Can you blame me?" He broadened his grin.

I cleared my throat.

Vigilance: "ER!" He leaned back, and looked at me, sheepishly. "Sorry, K."

K: "Uh-huh." I shook my head. "You two!" I wagged a finger at them. "You're as bad as-" I felt a hoof slide up my ass. "-hello, honey."

Applejack: "We'll make it a group vacay, Vig." She smirked. "Dusty'n'I'll wanna come with." And she shrugged a bit. "This place's down right romantic. No reason y'all wouldn't feel a lil' somethin'."

Vigilance: "You're right." He shrugged. "War first, though."

And nodded, got up, and offered his mare a hoof. She pretended to blush at his gentlecoltly gesture, accepted the hoof, and when he easily pulled her up, she let the momentum carry her to a kiss on his cheek. She then tousled his mohawk a bit.

Applejack: "Bad as us, honeybun." She giggled, and went to get her Go-Bag.

We took a couple of the 5-meter launches to shore. There was a small fishing village on the coast, and we picked there for our landing. Thermopylae was joined by the Coastal Defense Cruisers Tilos and Minos, and the Cutters Rhodes and Kastos. Not a bad little fleet.. if this was 1910 in Earth years.

It troubled me that the Macedonkian fleet had been about as modern as ours. The only thing they didn't account for was aircraft. And I wasn't entirely sure why.

Whispering Grove and her Marines got us up to the docks. We tied off and disembarked. It was me, Vig, Colgate, Applejack, and Fluttershy. The rest of the girls were on the Thermopylae with Sherby.

Vigilance: "K.. this place seem a little dead to you?" He shrugged. "War or no war, I'd expect a welcoming committee."

K: "Good point." I nodded. "Let's move in carefully - the villagers might've just been spooked by seeing Macedonkian warships and evacuated inland." I pointed ahead of me, and three Marines advanced.

We moved to the end of the docks, and into the main part of the village.

We did not have to wait long. A gunshot rang out from the village administration building, and down went one of the Marines. I was closest, so, I grabbed and dragged them back behind cover.

We didn't shout, we didn't panic, we simply moved back. Fluttershy was on the Fox Marine immediately, and started treating him.

K: C> "Alpha Actual to Alpha Roberts." I keyed my Mic.

Sherby: C> "Go."

K: C> "Land the Marines. They're here." I snorted a bit in frustration.

Applejack: "Ah got 'im in sight. Donkey alright. Up thar with a Herdiet rifle. Looks like the one Rarity used." She grumbled.

K: "Lovely. Well, we know who was helping them, now." I shrugged. "I'm not happy. I expected this, but I'm not happy." I shook my head. "I'll deal with Dear Leader later. Anyone got a bead on that sniper?"

Vigilance: "Mmm.. I can drop an egg on him, but we don't know where the civilians are." He shrugged.

Colgate: "We need to get this Marine back to the ship. He needs a proper Doctor." She frowned. "I got the bleeding patched, but it's not in a good spot, K."

K: "Roger." I nodded, and waved to Sergeant Grove, then pointed to the Sniper. "No Explosives!" I called.

She nodded, and moved up her Platoon's machine gun. The foxes manning it got it into position, braced on a stone wall. The sniper took a shot at them, but missed by a hair. They opened up, and put about 15 rounds into the bell tower. The sniper fell through the wooden slats, and to the ground.

That's when we started taking fire from EVERYWHERE. The sides, the front, and the rear. We were fully covered.

K: "GET TO COVER AND RETURN FIRE!" I called out, grabbing the injured Fox, and heaving him over my shoulder, before buffalo'ing through a glass window and into the house we were taking shelter behind.

After a bit of movement, I could hear everyone returning fire. I also heard the guns from the Cruisers open up, and start hitting the area. They were calling naval gunfire support. I was with Colgate, Vigilance, Fluttershy, and Applejack. Vigilance and I slid up to the first floor front window. Applejack took the window I'd barged through.

Vigilance: "I think we're in a bit of trouble." He murr'd. "Looks like.. two companies and change. They're dug in everywhere - they were expecting us."

K: "Probably invaded this island before the attack on Athens." I opined. "I'm betting a lot of the outlying islands were picked off as fast and stealthily as possible."

Vigilance: "Not good." He frowned. "What's our play?"

K: "Wait for the rest of the Marine Detachment to land, for now. Evac our casualties, retake the village." I nodded. C> "Alpha to all callsigns. Once the rest of the formation starts to land, look to break from cover, pick an axis of advance, and make for it. Aim back towards the docks."

Colgate: "Well, it's a good thing we came, then." She frowned a bit.

Applejack: "Shapin' up to be a big campaign, honeybun." She fired off a few shots, and I heard a loud 'hee-haw!' in the distance. "Reckon it'll be like the East Indies?"

K: "As big. Or bigger." I nodded. "And we're down to two Surface Battle Groups. Good thing our allies have the big stick for once." I smirked a bit. "We got this. As usual, this is going to hurt, but we got this."

Vigilance: "Yeah." He fired a grenade shell, and I heard the impact cause some casualties among the enemy. "Tirek seems to like doing this."

We looked at him.

Vigilance: "What? I'm not wrong. I know it. Herdiets might've armed and advised 'em, but I don't see no ponies out there - just Donks. This is right up Tirek's alley - division between races, start fights, and keep us off balance." He nodded to me.

K: "Can't fault the logic." I shook my head, and was reminded just how veteraned some of my troops were - to the point where the strategic aspect, wasn't just part of their thinking, but something they could register a proper opinion on.

My smart, brave friends.

It took the Fox Marines a bit to start getting close to shore, but I knew when they were getting closer - one of the cutters escorted them as close as possible, and opened up with machine guns and autocannon.

Fluttershy: "Ahm.. they'll be here soon. We can break out." She nodded.

K: "Alright. I'll get him." I pointed to the Fox. "You guys cover me."

Colgate: "Right." She loaded a smoke shell in her Knox. "I'll give 'em a little smoke."

Vigilance: "Ready." He nodded, taking point.

Applejack: "Ah got th' rear." She moved up behind me.

K: "Go!" I hefted the Fox over my shoulder.

We broke out. As soon as we cleared the building, Colgate laid down smoke on the nearest enemy position. Vigilance gave that a few taps, and switched aim to the next nearest one ahead of him. Fluttershy did the same, but on the other side of the single file. Applejack cleaned up any that survived the others.

We got to the beach, just as one of the Launches got there. As the troops disembarked, we got the wounded Fox in, and were soon joined by several other groups, putting their wounded inside.

Capt. Silverfish: "General!" He slid up to me, and nodded. "What went wrong?"

K: "Everything, I-" I looked as Sergeant Grove's body was loaded into the Launch with a blanket over her. "-you're losing good Foxes, Captain."

Another one I'd remember.

Applejack: "We need t'sweep th' Island." She nodded. "Have th' other ships drop all their Marines, too."

Vigilance: "Break them up by Platoon. We have 11. Move half up along one side of the island to the south, the other half to the north, and the remaining leftover force stays here to hold the beach. First job, get the village swept." He nodded.

Capt. Silverfish: "Yes, sir." He nodded and moved off.

K: "Good going, Vig." I smirked.

Vigilance: "Ehh, you expect it at this point." He shrugged.

K: "Aright, let's get going." I nodded as the Medics got the Launch into the water.

This wasn't going to be an easy campaign indeed. But, it would have to be decisive, or the Foxes would just get bullied again, later, after I'm gone. No matter "how" I'm gone.
