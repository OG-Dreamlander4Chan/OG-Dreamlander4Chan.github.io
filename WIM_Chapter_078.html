Part 1: Antidote

TIME: 14:04 ERDT
DATE: War Day 713/17 Tertious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: East Cahokia, Inoka

It took Zecora two days, and then some, to gather all the materials. It took her most of the morning to mix them in controlled conditions.

I was in her temporary tent workshop with her, helping out, since I had hands.

Zecora: "Tha Bat Salt, please." She asked. "Two shakes."

I did as instructed, then looked over the brewstand to her.

K: "Zecora, I have.. first I want to apologize. Almost two years ago, because of me, your home was destroyed, and you were gravely injured." I shrugged.

Zecora: *Warmly* "Ahh.. faghettaboutit, sugah." She smiled at me. "Best excitement I had in yea'hs."

K: "Thing is, I barely came to see you afterwards." I shrugged. "I mean.."

Zecora: "War's war, eh?" She cut me off with reassurance. "I ain't just a pretty face, I know when someone cares 'bout me. Ya gave me an unlimited budget ta build a new place any way I wanted, broke some rules'n'laws, I know, ta git me some'a'them ingredients, too." She shrugged.

K: "I felt guilty that you lost everything." I frowned. "I've been at a point in my life where I've been close to giving UP everything.. all my material things.. I know what it's like to have a precious little and want to defend it. Keep it. And how it'd hurt to lose it."

Zecora: "S'fine." She added another ingredient, and used a reed to stir it. "Yer otha' question's whether're not.." She looked up at me, and smiled. "..I wants'ta make some rhymes wit'cha." And winked.

K: "..yeah, actually." I shrugged, nonchalantly. "I just want to know where we stand."

Zecora: "Oh, I would. I would, honey, an' wit' some.." She looked at her saddle bags. "..chemical enhancements.." She grinned flirtatiously at me. "..see if I can knock the Monkey Sex God off'a his throne."

K: "But..?" There was less 'dripping with lust' there than there was with just about every other mare that'd thrown themselves at me.

Zecora: "Be honest wit'cha." She shrugged. "I don't find yer form.. make me tingle in all'a the right places, yanno?" She tilted her head. "Nah.. I got my eye on a pony back in Ponyville. Goofy lil' Pegasus guy named Puffy Clouds." She nodded with a smile. "Now, if I had'ta do it to save th' world or.. some cultural shit.. yeah, I would. But.. not.. you know."

K: "I appreciate the honesty." I shrugged.

She gave me a friendly kiss on the cheek.

Zecora: "Don't mean I don't care about'cha, though. Yer like family." She patted my cheek.

K: "That's worth a lot more to me than a roll in the hay." I gave her a big hug. "Sex is a few hours and done. Friendships.. familyships.. that's for life."

Zecora: "Yeh. That's why I care. You GET it." She turned back to her brew, and added the last three ingredients.

K: "So, what'll this do? What's the effective range?" I shrugged.

Zecora: "Ehh.. Radio drinks 'dis, she'll start puttin' off waves within a few minutes. Range? Few hundred metahs." She nodded. "Drive'er around them mounds, she'll make 'em all drop dead. After that, clean 'em up an' burn the bodies to ash."

K: "Sounds good." I nodded. "And the potion just flushes out of her system?"

Zecora: "Yeh. We tried a few small'ah potions b'fore, to.. you know.. see what's up. Make sure stuff like this won't hurt 'er. Near's I can figger, she's.. like.. immune to alchemy." A shrug.

K: "As long as it doesn't hurt her." I nodded.

Zecora: "She'll be fine. Promise! Also.. it's done!" She held up a large Erlenmeyer Flask filled with a bubbling, swirling brew.

We went outside, and over to Radio, who was.. uh.. inspecting the troops with Norfy.

K: *AHEM!* I coughed loudly, at the two of them cuddling in the supply tent.

Norfy: "AH!" He was a bit surprised. "Sorry, K. I.. thought you'd be longer."

I gave him a sidewise glance, and a bro-nudge in the shoulder.

K: "I thought the same thing." And an eeevil grin.

Norfy: "ACK! HEY!" He flushed a deep maroon.

Radio: "Oh, trust me, K.. he's PLENTY long." She knit her brow at me, with a likewise evil smirk.

Norfy: "EEP!" If he could turn a shade darker, his head would pop.

Zecora: "Eh." She shrugged. "I got potions fer that, too." She dismissively chided. "Anyway, potion's ready." She held it up. "Effective fer about four hours, but we won't need that long. Drink it, hop on a truck, and drive around."

K: "I'll drive." I nodded.

Radio: "CAN you drive?" She tilted her head at me, and took the flask, while Norfy was busy trying to tame his erection and get his uniform back on.

K: "Yeah." I nodded. "I designed them, partially." I shrugged. "They're a bit small for me, but I can fit if I slide the seat bench out."

Radio: "Alright." She poked her Stallion. "Get dresseed, already! I want you on the Browning in case this goes south on us!" She snorted, and flicked her tail in his face.

Norfy: "Ah..ey..yes..uh.." *COUGH* He was flustered, baaaaad..

Gaze: "Oi, Norf!" He poked his head in, with Cosmic, seeing what was transpiring. "Ech.. ain't th' first time I seen that." He snorted, dismissively. "Figger we're ready, K?"

K: "We are. As soon as Norfy gets his pants on." I smiled.

Gaze: "Aye, ah'll git a truck." He slid out.

Cosmic: "Well, Pinkie would say something about us needing to keep our.. spirits.. up." He smirked at Norfy.

A SHOT ACROSS THE BOW! From the former "NERD!" even!

He got a magical snowball to the face, and laughed like a loon.

A few minutes later, and we were loaded up. Dusty was riding shotgun with me. Since I'M the one that designed vehicles, I went with the American layout - driver on the left - and made that the world standard.

This world may force me to use Metric, but I'm not giving up ALL of my Americanisms!

Indeed, driving these is cramped for me, but the gas, clutch, and break pedals are designed to be adjusted for non-Pony drivers, and with the bench seat removed and me sitting right on the riser for it, with the pedals all the way forward, I just barely could fit in one of these and drive. My knees were still bent a bit more than I would like, though.

Radio downed the potion, and started giving off a blue-green aura. Strong enough, that I could feel the Sword of Rainbow's Light react to it.

We drove.

A slow circuit around all the Mounds.

We could hear them scream.

The ones caught outside simply melted.

I felt bad.. these used to be Ponies, now twisted by dark magic.. and it looked like this mercy upon them.. was painful. It was the safest option for us, but.. I wished it could have been painless.

After a three hour drive, we returned.

K: "Colonel, Major." I nodded to the senior officers. "It is done. They're all dead. All of them. Everything's scrubbed. I want teams from Recon and Rangers going into the mounds and cleaning them out, just in case. Once that's done, Zecora said the portals can be disrupted and shut down with an explosive charge."

Major Bellweather: "Yes, General." She nodded. "Thank you. This.. this was an experience."

K: "Yeah. And now, your Regiment has been blooded. This may not translate so well to Porcine and Raptorians, but they now know what it means to kill to save their lives." I put a hand on their shoulder. "And they have a good Commander. When we invade Tirek's home land, I have every confidence in the 20th Regiment."

Major Bellweather: "Yes, SIR!" She puffed up a bit.

With that, the situation in Inoka was solved. I didn't like the outcome one bit. We'd executed 72 ponies for treason. We knew they'd sacrificed all the citizens that lived in the south of the town, and at LEAST 57 more 'tourists' to these creatures.

And, we found, these creatures weren't the mindless evil monsters we thought they were. They were former ponies, in pain, twisted by blackest magic, driven by unearthly hunger. And we had no choice but to kill them in a very unmerciful way to save ourselves.

In a way, this did reflect on how, in War, it's not always a black-and-white choice on the battlefield. Sometimes, you have to make morally grey decisions, to save the lives of your troops. Maybe we could have done something more? I don't know. I'd never know, for sure.

[End of Part 1]

Part 2: Coltago

TIME: 17:22 Greenwich Mean Time
DATE: War Day 714/18 Tertious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Coltago, Inoka

I was dressed up. Dusty? Was practically green with envy.

K: "Don't think I don't have something planned for you." I looked at her in the mirror.

Dusty: "Oh, K. You know I'd be fine with going to a sandwich shop and sitting by the lake or something." She smirked. "You don't HAVE to do fancy things for me."

She was, indeed, even more comfortable with that than Applejack. Don't get me wrong, my Pony wife loves the casual and laid back, but there IS that part of her that's still an Orange, and still likes occasional glitz and glamour. Dusty? Had been raised around the "plastic glitz" of Las Pegasus, and, truth, really didn't care for the taste.

K: "Yes, but.. I want to." I nodded. "You'll see." I grinned.

Octavia showed up, in a rather classy dress and heels. Her handbag.. was.. she had her Morgan in there, I knew it. Still a Ranger.

Octavia: "Well, I'm dressed!" She smirked at me. "Now, what was this about showing me around Coltago? As far as I know, you've never BEEN here."

K: "I've never been to COLT-ago.. I grew up in CHIC-ago." I smirked. "Chicago, Illinois." A small gesture. "Here, Coltago, Inoka. I checked a map, and the city is laid out like Chicago was about 1932 in my world. That means, I know the city. I could be blindfolded and get you from the Loop to the North Side." I held out my arm. "Octavia, I promised you an evening. You wanted to see. See if something there might've swerved me from the path of Applejack. You've been wondering for four years. I intend to make my best effort."

Octavia: "Mm.." She took my arm. "Which will either lead me to insane jealousy that you married Applejack, or a confirmation that we would not be a match."

K: "Exactly. But. I am going to charm you like I'm not a married man. I'm going to give this a fair chance. It's what was promised you when you helped save the kids." I gave her a warm smile.

Vy: "..we'll be ready to QRF if you get into trouble, K." She snorted a bit. "There's a nice little restaurant up the block from Union Station. I've BEEN to Coltago.. did a few gigs here. We'll have our radios on us." She slid up to Octavia. "Tavi. I want you to have the best evening ever. But, for Celestia's sake, be careful. We get into so much trouble." She was being.. protective.

Octavia: "I have the hoof - arm - of the single most desireable male on the planet, that also happens to be our commanding General, and a highly capable warrior. Nothing. Will. Happen." She was almost.. well, very firm about this, but almost like she would freely bend the Universe to her will to get this.

K: "Shall we go?" I said, and Octavia nodded.

It wasn't time for dinner, yet, so.. our first stop was this world's version of Navy Pier: Coltago Lakeshore Pavillion. Just like Navy Pier in Chicago, The Pavillion was a huge, covered structure sitting out over the lake that had a hundred and one uses.

Today? The Coltago Philharmonic Orchestra was playing... what she didn't know, is, I'd.. messed with things.

The fun part of being - more or less - third in charge of the whole country, is that I can send things like sheet music, my dear friend's cello, and orders that the Coltago Philharmonic open a chair for her..

When we walked into the music hall, the director, Dr. Notesonly Clef, met us.

Dr. Clef: "AH! You.. you MUST be Octavia Melody!" He bowed to her.

Octavia: "Y-You're.. Dr. Clef.." She looked at me. "I.. I thought we were just going to hear a concert?!"

K: "My Dear.. today.. you're the featured Cellist." I kissed her hoof.

She was tearing up.. as Concerto arrived with her Cello.

Concerto: "Octavia. K." He nodded. "I brought it, like you asked." He shrugged.

She teared up even more, not really able to form words. Coltago's Philharmonic Orchestra was.. in Equestria.. the third most prestigious, after Fillydelphia and Canterlot's, but ahead of Manehattan, Denver and Los Angeles.

This had been on her list of Orchestras she wanted to try out for. Before the War.

Octavia: "I.." She cleared her throat. "..K, thank you.." She blinked, having to dab tears with her kerchief. "Let me.. go get warmed up." She slipped her Cello case into her hoof and went with Dr. Clef.

Concerto: "..you're really doing something special for her." He trailed off.

K: "I can never repay any of them for everything they've done, Concerto, but I want to make at least some dreams come true, for whatever time I have here." I said, pointedly. "I can't do anything for Berry, other than immortalize her name. Octavia? I can.. do quite a bit." I put a hand on his shoulder. "Vy says you're dating."

Concerto: "Yeah.. uh.." He cleared his throat. "..I met this Guard, see?" He smiled a bit. "Silk Moon. She.. ah.. she saved me from the Vampires."

K: "I met her. Good Pony." I nodded. "Thanks again, Concerto."

Concerto: "No, thank you, K. I mean.. even after everything that's happened.. you care." He nodded.

K: "I always will." I nodded back.

The piece that Octavia played was one of the songs that I'd had Spike transcribe. This was the first time it was being played in Equestria at an orchestral performance. And, moreover, it was a chance for Octavia to take center stage.. in front of a huge crowd of very Society Ponies.

Her play was flawless.. filled with deep emotion, style, and grace. The applause was thunderous.. and she was thrown several bouquets. One of them was from me. She gathered a few up, bowed, and was just about sobbing with joy as she left the stage at the end of the performance.

I met her backstage.

She embraced me so tightly, so warmly..

Octavia: "K.. that.. that was absolutely magical.." She was smiling a mile wide.

K: "Mm.. and it's time for dinner." I offered her my arm.

Octavia: "Knowing you? You probably already have reservations." She smiled.

K: "Oh, yeah. But.. not quite what you think." I said, leading her to the taxi (with Concerto picking up her cello - this was his first night with them as official third chair).

We went to Little Roam (Little Italy), and were dropped off at a nice, but fairly small, Roaman restaurant. I escorted her inside.

It wasn't the glitz. It was the food. The smells of expertly crafted Roaman dishes infiltrate the nostrils as soon as you enter. While the restaurant is "classy," it's not "glitzy." There's a big difference.

Magistrano Olivier: "AH! Meester K! Mees Melody!" He nodded. "Your table awaits!" He escorted us to the table, and as with Mario & Luigi's restaurant in Manehattan, I tipped him as well. As I said, tipping the Maitre'D is going out of style. "Would you care to see the Wine list?"

I looked at Octavia.. I knew she liked wine, but not nearly as much as Rarity..

She batted her eyes at him.

Octavia: "Yes, please.." She nodded to me just a bit.

The list was - as I'd been coached by Rarity - filled with some good vintages and years.

K: "They have fresh Calamari, here." I nodded to her.

Octavia: "OH!" She blinked. "I so rarely get it..! I usually have to make it myself.. ah.." She flushed. "If it's not too presumptuous, I'd like the Calamari pasta.. and the Vinito Giorgio to go with it."

Matching wines to her dishes.

K: "Spaghetti Bolognese. And coffee." I nodded. "Remember, I don't drink."

Octavia: "I know.. it's why a Lady feels so safe around you, K." She batted her eyes at me, just a bit.

Magistrano: "Of'a course!" He bowed, and moved away.

Octavia: "You've been.. so amazing, K." She blushed.

K: "I will say, I would indeed do things like this, had we ended up together." I gently took her hooves into my hands. "You wanted to know."

Octavia: "I did." She blushed a bit deeper. "I think.. I'm having some second thoughts, now.."

K: "Wish it'd remained a mystery?" I tilted my head.

Octavia: "Ah.. do.. you play an instrument?" She changed the subject.

K: "I do. Baritone Horn. Haven't played in years, but I could probably figure it out again, if I was handed one." I shrugged. "My arms were too short for a trombone."

Octavia: "Oh!" *Giggle*

We were served, and the food was amazing. There was a big difference between my "ideal date" with Applejack and Octavia. Applejack had no idea what a real "fancy dream date" was like, and had no expectations. Octavia? She'd been on the fringe of fancy for most all of her adult and teenage life. She had seen the fancy, the real glamour.. and desperately wanted every bit of it.

Not something you can get being a cellist, really.

But, that meant, she had high standards. Expectations for her "fancy dream date." That mingled with both the highest class, and the middle class. Wish fulfillment grounded with positive reality.

That meant, to me, that I had to blow all of them out of the water, to show her a snapshot of how I would have courted her, had I not ended up with Applejack, but her instead. Show her my own refinement, my own manners, my own sense of fancy.

Tragically, we were meshing far too well.

Octavia: "That Tiramisu was something special!" She giggled. "The food was amazing.. rich, but not ponderous." She was also.. just a bit drunk.

K: "I'm not done, yet." I smirked.

Octavia: "I.." Another blush.

I paid and tipped the waiter, and got us another Taxi. To the lake shore, by what would be Grant Park in my Chicago. No Ulysses Grant? No Grant Park - it was simply Lakeshore Park, here, but mostly intact.

Tonight, there was a moonlight concert by a local string quartet. We were dropped off right by the lake shore.

K: "If this was my Chicago, we'd be getting robbed right about now." I said, taking her hoof, and walking to the edge of the boardwalk.

Octavia: "..K." She blinked. "I think I already have been." She slid against me.

K: "I'm sorry." I brushed a lock of her hair aside, looking into her gorgeous eyes..

..we slipped together..

The kiss was a symphony of emotions. She tastes like.. Earl Grey Tea, sweet cream, and a touch of honey.

I held her, as we swayed back and forth, listening to the music, and watching the moon and stars dance..

Part 3: Reflection

TIME: 09:22 Greenwich Mean Time
DATE: War Day 715/19 Tertious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Departing Coltago

I woke up with a very happy snuggling Octavia in my arms. We'd walked around Coltago some after the moonlight concert, just enjoying each others' company. When we got back to the train, everyone'd gone to sleep - and Dusty, despite her jealousy, had tactfully snagged Octavia's bunk near Vy and Dex in one of the cabins.

We both decided that.. well.. we both wanted each other in the worst way. And at the same time, we both knew that if we did it, we'd both be feeling a huge twinge of regret that our lives never went this way. All the talking we'd done, revealed that we were, indeed, compatible. That I would have done anything to help her career, moved anywhere she wanted, even played with her if she'd asked, taking up an artform I'd long since let fall into ill practice. That I enjoyed music (I really do), of all kinds, and I would have.. been there for her.

This regret gave way to cuddles.. very tender cuddles. Soft cuddles of reassurance.

We did not fuck.

Octavia would go down as the only other Pony that I'd taken on a date, matched up very well with on some level, but did not take to bed. We couldn't bear the idea, we were far too close as friends, that we both missed something.

Perhaps if we hadn't only met at the party, with me playing peacemaker. Perhaps if I'd landed in her yard, instead. Perhaps if I'd asked her to dance with me, felt that spark on that first night. Perhaps if she hadn't been greviously wounded.

Perhaps.

Truth be told, I had this problem in abundance. I was married and dedicated to Applejack - she was so much my soulmate that it hurt. I loved Luna. We were co-parents together, and I knew that if I wound up being Immortal, I would be with her until the Sun consumed the Moon a billion years from now. Now, I had Dusty.. the rough and tumble mare from Las Pegasus that had a hoof in either of my worlds - the Wiseguy and the Country Boy born in the wrong place.

Now, Octavia knew, and I knew, that the Musician and Society/Formal Man in me also had a very solid match that would have meant great happiness.

So, we cuddled. Because neither of us could stand it if sex turned out to be amazing, too.

Dusty, however, came in with breakfast.

Dusty: "So? How was he?" She smirked.

Octavia: "A perfect gentleman." She sat up and stretched. "Be glad he did not suddenly crash into my Orchestra the day he came to Equestria, Dusty, or you would've been a mere security pony for one of our concerts." She shrugged.

Dusty: "I had a feeling about that." She sat on the bed. "K's too good of a human. He's got too many good things about him - too many talents." She shrugged and patted her hoof. "I can tell you didn't try the sex." She bit her lip a bit. "Be glad, it's addicting."

K: "It's only that way because Stallions last about 15 to 30 seconds, it's a biological thing. And I can go hours. But, really, compared to other humans, I'm probably about average when it comes to the basic mechanics." I finally chimed in. "Octavia and I are much closer friends, now, and we had an amazing time, but you're right, Dusty, I didn't.. we couldn't."

Octavia: "It would have led to too many regrets." She gave a bit of a sad smile. "Thank you for loaning him to me, though." She slithered out of bed. "I'm going to go assure Vy that I did not hop on the Monkey's Banana or whatever silly terms she was using for it."

That was an unsaid "He's all yours."

TIME: 11:34 ERDT

We were going through La Porte, Neshinabe (Indiana), when I finally extracted myself from Dusty, and we ate the (now cold) breakfast she'd originally brought.

Dusty: "You.. really have a complex love life, huh?" She snuggled me, though.

K: "Yeah. It's been said before, but you ponies are genetically predisposed to seek out another pony of absolutely compatible talent and complimentary skill. My problem, being human, like I told you once before, is.. I'm adaptable and I have SO MANY talents and complimentary skills. It drives the mares crazy, your biology is being tugged at constantly." I shrugged. "I'm just happy Applejack is very aware of this, and.. is okay with it. To a point. She's already independently bedded Luna just because." I smirked.

Dusty: "Oh-ho-HO! No one told me THAT one!" She grinned cheesily.

K: "Yup. Apparently, Luna is VERY flexible in her sexuality, and.. Applejack has.." I winked. "..very good tongue skills."

Dusty: "Rarity's supposed to be better." She smirked.

K: "Not with Mares, she isn't!" I grinned.

Dusty: "OHHHhhhh! Juicy gossip!" She beamed a grin.

K: "..I really hope I get to stay here.." I said, suddenly.

Dusty rolled into my lap and pushed me down on the bed, a bagel still in her mouth, and she clung to me like a drowning person would, a life ring. I found myself hugging her, holding her, enjoying being with her, despite everything that was going on around us. Despite the skinwalkers, the war, and everything else, I just.. stopped everything, and enjoyed what I had.

Several hours later, we arrived in Lashing, Michigami for fuel and to take on water for the boilers. Since the incident in Cahokia, we changed our route, so, Spitfire saw to it we took on a resupply, here.

There were so many things going through my mind on this trip, it didn't surprise me that I spent a lot of it in my cabin. The Anniversary was coming up in a few days. We would be going to Paris for it, as a symbol of our connection to our NEIGHTO allies.

At the same time, I was wondering... how much is enough? If a magical solution can't be had, then how much would I need, to stop Tirek? How many graves must I fill? How many atomic weapons might I require?

And there was the ever present dread about what would become of ME afterwards. Would I go home? Would I be made immortal? Niether of those sat good with me. No outcome did. I was too invested in this world, these ponies, to want to leave them. But, I wanted to see my J-- again.

Whatever happened, however it happened, I would end this war as fast and as safely as possible. For these ponies that I called family and friend.

Part 4: Respite

TIME: 13:22 ERDT
DATE: War Day 717/21 Tertious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Ponyville, Equestria

Here's an odd one! Daddy and Big Brother Big Mac coming home.. but not mommy!?

I was first in the door, and found Koringo coloring. I leaned over real careful, and picked her up!

Koringo: "WHEEEEEEEEE!!! PAPA-SAN!!!" She giggled as I gave her tummy tickles.

Starlight Mint: "DADDY!" She came over and hugged me.

Applebloom: "K!" She zoomed over to Big Mac, though. "Big Brother!"

Rolfe: "POP!" He about tackled me.

Pomme: "Oui!? Is PaPa!!" She set down her cooking and dove into the pile.

Granny Smith: "Ahhh! There's'ma two legged grandson!" She came over and.. EVEN SHE hugged me. "We miss't ya, young fella!"

K: "Aww.. well, I'm here for a few days, at least. The Girls are still in Crystalpolis, solving THEIR issues and looking for clues." I set down my Go Bag, and the kids INSTANTLY rifled it.

They all came away with marked goodies.

Pomme: "Oooouhhh! PaPa got me a new Dolly! Und a BEAUTIFUL new dress! Notes of Music on it?" She beamed.

K: "Auntie Octavia helped pick it out." I nodded.

Starlight Mint: "Appleloosa.. Cahokia.. Coltago.. Detrot.. wooow!" She studied her new snow globes.

K: "Yup. East Cahokia didn't have any snowglobes, so, I got two for Cahokia." I shrugged.

Rolfe: "HEY! An official army Machete! And what.. what's this?!" He held up a Def Leppard T-Shirt I'd had made. "New shirt! What's a.. deaf leopard?" He pronounced it like the right words.

K: "Daddy killed Skinwalkers. That was on a shirt they were wearing." I nodded. "It's an old rock band from 8,000 years ago - Uncle Teddy's time."

Rolfe: "AWESOME!"

Koringo: "Oooo.. is new dress up doll! And new tea set!" She showed them off.

Pomme: "We must have zee tea partie, little sister!" She hugged Rolfe. "You are invited - no tea partie is complete wisout zee gentleman!"

K: "Hey, that's pretty spiffy. Back in my day, they were girls only affairs!" I smirked.

Rolfe: "I'll wear my best uniform! And afterwards, we can do combat practice!" He smirked.

Starlight: "Good idea. Never know what'll pop up." She nodded firmly.

Koringo: "Hai! And I make traps!" She grinned, cheekily.

Mac: "Heh.. seems the kids're already makin' plans!" He grinned.

K: "Eh, I'm glad for it." I nodded. "Granny, don't you worry about dinner - the Palace is coming to US!" I nodded firmly.

Granny: "OH! Be nice'ta have a break!" She grinned.

K: "Mac... bro.." I shrugged. "..just relax! We're off duty for a few days. My orders!" I nodded firmly.

Mac: "Heh.. EYUP!" He grinned widely.

So, for four days and nights, I played Daddy to my kids. A few people were shuffled around for the trip to Paris, and Luna came down from Canterlot to Ponyville for a couple of those days, to spend time with Starlight Mint.

She made it very clear, Starlight did, that we MUST take her to the Paris Celebration, if for no other reason than to recognize her birth parents.

TIME: 11:05 ERDT
DATE: War Day 722/26 Tertious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Canterlot, Capital District, Equestria

K: "..so, you see, Celestia, the Parliamentary System I'm proposing would free you from most of your duties. You can still perform your ceremonies, and still meet with the few odd Petitioners, but much of the Government would run itself." I nodded.

I was explaining my personal idea for how Equestria would be run after the war.

Celestia: "Alright, K. You know about all of this - what are the pitfalls?" She sipped her tea.

K: "A few. First, you must never allow the Bureaucracy to expand, to meet the needs of the expanding Bureaucracy - that is, don't add layers of specifics to disguise and disrupt the interaction between Citizens and a Responsible Party. Simple example. Applejack needs a new Well dug. Under the current system, she'd have to submit a request to Mayor Mare, and whenever Mare got around to it, it'd likely be approved. A centralized Government Office of Water Management could take that responsibility for Mare, send out an inspector to make sure she's going to dig in the right place, and issue a certificate to approve construction. The PITFALL would be having Applejack go to this Office, request an appointment, meet with an Inspector, get another appointment to inspect the Well proposal, make her subit that proposal seperately, have the Inspector lack the authority to issue the certificate themselves, force the Inspector to submit the proposals and inspection verification to someone else, who then approves it.. to be sent to an unelected board of water management, who will hold a hearing to determine if Applejack has a right to build a Well on her own property." I shrugged. "And before you ask, in the human world, it's WORSE than that in some areas!"

Celestia: "Dear ME!" She snorted. "That.. that IS a conflicted bureaucracy." She nodded.

K: "Best solution would be to have Ponies who are - in this case Well Inspectors - have the authority to inspect the Well and issue the certificate immediately, as long as the Well construction plan is solid. And if it isn't, have both the education and the authority to instruct them how to fix the plan, approve THAT, then issue the Certificate. Just for this example. And the Chief Inspector's position in each District should be ELECTABLE. That way - not saying ponies would - but, if some Inspectors weren't up to standard and their friendship with the Chief Inspector keeps them from getting fired or reassigned, the Chief Inspector can be replaced at the next election, and change can be had. Avoiding Bureaucracy is as simple as maintaining proper authority in a select number of hands, backed by elected officials no more than one or two levels above them, who have the authority to unilaterally remove and replace defective government employees." I nodded.

Celestia: "Mm.. and this Parliament.." She nodded.

K: "Simple enough. Two houses of Parliament mimicking the American system - a House of Representatives, and a House of Ministers. The Representatives represent the Ponies directly, and are elected every four years. The Ministers represent the interests of the State Houses of Parliament, and are appointed by those houses by an election within them, every six years. At the State level, two Houses again. A Senate and a House of Representatives. Both are elected directly by the People - Representatives on a District level, and Senators on a Township level. Rowed Island has 24 Townships and 52 Districts. They would elect two Representatives per District, and one Senator per Township, for 104 Representatives and 24 Senators. All by popular vote." I nodded. "The Parliament, once assembled, would then vote on a First Minister of Parliament, and you would select a Prime Minister of Equestria. The First Minister would be second to the Prime Minister, but Parliament would retain the authority to override certain choices made my the Prime Minister if the First Minister requests so. The Prime Minister would have many of your powers - Absolution to a lesser degree, direct Petition, promotion of officers, appointment of Cabinet Secretaries and Office Ministers, like a Minister of Finance. If Parliament objects strongly to an Appointment, they can interfere and force a vote on the Candidate. The Prime Minister would be bound by the results, unless YOU decide to interfere directly. Thing is, though, you wouldn't really have to."

Celestia: "..because of the nature of this world and the higher level of honesty, team work, and sense of fair play that Ponies have." She nodded, finishing the thought.

K: "Indeed." I nodded. "And I know who I'd want as your first Prime Minister."

Celestia: "Mmm.. I think I know, but tell me anyway." She smirked.

K: "Twilight. Of course. You set her up to learn about all of the things happening in this world - and put her in a position to try and stop the bad things from occuring. Problem is, the world conspired against you, and if I hadn't arrived, you'd.. probably be dead right now, and so would they. Things changed. Maybe you wanted her to be a new Princess?" I tilted my head. "Chrissy was hinting at that with her final breath." I smirked. "What, you think I forgot?"

Celestia: "..it's true. Remember, I said I wanted Ponies to take over Pony affairs. I WANTED to be able to retire into obscurity again, and let someone like Twilight simply take over." She shrugged her wings. "I see, now, that this wasn't the right course of action. Radical change. A gradual change where they become less reliant on me and Luna, but we're still around as figureheads of decreasing importance, is probably the way to go in the future." She sighed a bit. "Be honest. How long do you think it'll take before they're ready for full self-governance?"

K: "If we solve all the problems and win the war without ruining the country in the process? Two or three generations, and you and Luna can start taking extended vacations for decades at a time. Five generations and you can probably just mostly retire. Seven to eight, and they won't need you two specifically, but they'll always need a Princess.. so.. if you don't make Twilight an Immortal.. you can pick one to groom for Princess-ship in about five to six generations, so they'll be ready when the time comes." I nodded. "Elected Government can do the rest, and as long as you maintain tight control over the Bureaucracy and not allow it to create a class of unelected bureaucratic officials that have all the technical authority, you'll be fine. Robust education, having Election Days be full Holidays, and taking a 'when in doubt, make them vote' path.. yeah." I shrugged, and gestured, grabbing up my coffee cup and finishing the contents.

Celestia: "You've given this some thought." She nodded. "I'm glad our General is wiser than just the ways of War." She gave me a wing-hug.

K: "This world, this country, is different from my own, but the same in many ways. The exact things WE do in MY land, won't work here. But! There are paralells. Things that can be modified to work. And one of the most important things? Having a simply-worded, but robust, and ironclad Constitution. I know Equestria has a Charter of Rights that's similar, but it doesn't have ironclad guarantees. A Constitution would." I nodded. "Among those most vital? And a LOT of people in my world would hate me for saying this. The right to bear arms." I nodded, again, firmly. "Any Nation that does not trust its Citizens with the ability, means, and education to forcefully overthrow their Government should it become despotic, is a Tyranny in the making. Even with tanks, battleships, and fighter planes.. all those equipment operators have to sleep somewhere, and between the local Militia and the Gendarmes and the private citizenry, should.. say.. some dark and evil wizard somehow subvert the elected government in the future, the Ponies, the Citizens, should have every means at their disposal to overthrow them."

Celestia: "Mmm.. considering Unicorn magic can be a deadly weapon all on its own? I can see why you'd have this line of thought, here, especially." She nodded. "Magic is a double-edged sword. Such a dark wizard like you stated, could turn the majority of Unicorns against the others if they had suchlike powers. But, they'd have a much harder time doing that to Earth Ponies and Pegasus Ponies." She shrugged.

K: "Exactly. If Magic gets corrupted entirely, a non-magical solution of equal force must be in the hands of the Ponies, so they can resist." I shrugged.

Celestia: "Interesting." She nodded.

K: "Absolute freedom of speech, even speech you don't like, is the first and most sacred right. You can't put out a call to arms, if you haven't the freedom to explain why it's needed. Third is security of one's possessions and privacy. Fourth, a guarantee against governmental abuse and intimidation - the right to refuse to answer questions, even in court." I skipped the 'qartering of soldiers' thing, since, the Miltia here would be so robust. "You get the idea. The Constitution should exist specifically to limit the Government and guarantee Rights to Ponies that should already exist."

Celestia: "Mmm.. and I presume this is based on your own Constitution?" She smirked.

K: "And a few others from my world. My nation is the only one that has robust guarantees of the right to bear arms, though. As a RIGHT, not a revokable privilege." I shrugged.

Celestia: "I see." She nodded. "Well, I do need to get to today's petitioners.. we must speak of this again, K. I want a real plan in place to make this work, as soon as the war ends." She shrugged her wings. "Until then, Autocratic rule, I'm afraid, is necessary."

K: "Indeed. Now.. I also need to prepare to head out to Prance." I nodded. "We will speak of this again, though."

With that, the real groundwork of a Government by the Pony, for the Pony, and of the Pony was laid. It wouldn't be quite like America, but it would have a.. very distinct American flavor to it.

And, I hoped, would indeed pave the road to self-governance.

[End of Part 4]


Part 5: Maine Crossing

TIME: 09:22 Greenwich Mean Time
DATE: War Day 724/28 Tertious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Lubec, Maine - Equestrian/Prench border

Now the intricacies of how the world is shaped differently come into play. The edge of Maine was connected to Prance, and to the south, was "Spain," hanging off the edge of the northern continent they called North Equus. The Bay of Bitscay formed a gulf between the three nations.

"Spain" had declined to join NEIGHTO thusfar. I wasn't sure if they expected the rest of us to handle Tirek, or if they simply had no stomach for a fight at all. This part of things, I had far better negotiators for - Starlight, the princesses, and my international partners.

Sacquet and his Legionnaires along with Havoc and his Rangers were waiting for us in town when we arrived. The girls, Katrina, and Jade were waiting as well.

The second I stepped off the train, though..

Starlight Mint: "MOMMY!" *WHUMPF!*

Applejack was tackled by my.. our daughter.

Applejack: "HONEYBUN!" I hugged her tightly. "Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here?"

Sacquet: "She came with her mother. Er, her second mother." He smirked and paced over.

Having been slammed aside, I got up, and dusted myself off. Applejack grabbed me and.. rather lewdly kissed me.

Applejack: "Ah missed yew.." She trilled into my ear when she was done, then wiggled her eyebrows at Dusty. "Hope y'all was kept in good comp'ny.." She smirked.

Dusty winked back with a grin - I was in for it tonight.

Braeburn: "Cuzin!" He.. interruped us, and gave her a hug.

Mac: "Sis." He nodded. "Family sends their regards." He looked at Braeburn and nudged him a bit.

Braeburn: "OH! Raight! Cuzin, this here's mah special somepony.." He dragged.. DRAGGED Soarin out of the train car by his tail.

Twilight: "Soarin?!" She was a bit surprised.

Rainbow Dash: "HA! I KNEW IT!" She had a very mischevious grin.

Gilda: "Ugh.." She waddled over. "K." And hugged me. "I'm going to probably Lay either tonight or tomorrow." She rubbed her belly. "God.." And thunked Gorcat in the arm. "..gave me awhole clutch, ya jerk!"

Gorcat: "HA!" He took the hit like it was nothing. "See? I was worthy." He smirked. "Boss." And a nod to me.

Princess Cadence: "K." She paced over and gave me a hug as well. "We heard there was a major engagement in Konzas and serious problems in Inoka."

Prince Sunshine: "Shame I missed it." He paced up, and bro-hoofed me.

Lord Sombra: "Indeed, my friend!" He nodded smartly.

K: "Long story short, the tanks work, but the 76mm gun is under-powered. I need to work on that - the enemy has Heavy Tanks of a design I've never seen before, but that very much fits the aesthetic of this world. And the 76's can't penetrate their armor from the front or sides." I shrugged, and pat Sombra on the shoulder. "That and Skinkwalkers are allergic to high velocity lead poisoning."

Cosmic: "Indeed. We either need a better anti-armor shell, or higher velocity." He shrugged, as Kiwi came over. "Hi, honey." They embraced.

K: "Well. Seems we're having a reunion, here - come on, let's go hit up a cafe and get something to eat, eh? We have a lot to talk about." I nodded to Rear Admiral Iris Emerald, and the others.

Yeah, just about all of my friends are here. Not just my staff, my friends. Family.

We found a large outside cafe that served sea food. We'd have to wait, anyway - my command train needed to be switched over to European track gauge, and that took some time.

Everyone got themselves a table, and we all got our hellos and hugs out of the way before getting to business.

Princess Cadence: "So.. we did find something." She nodded to Twilight.

Twilight: "Megan left a book behind." She pulled it out and handed it to me. "It was in the basement of the royal library - we never would have found it if Spike and his girlfriend.."

Spike was over there, doing the "cut it off" motions with his hand.

Twilight, gave him a bemused smile, blushed slightly, and continued.

Twilight: "..hadn't been exploring down there." She gave me a bit of a grin.

K: "Exploring." I smirked. "I didn't get to that kind of exploring until I was older." I broadened that to a cheesy grin.

Smolder: "Ah!" She blushed, hard.

Spike: "I.. that is, we.. uhm..!" He turned even redder.

K: "Relax, Spike." I shrugged. "You're a teenager, it's natural."

Twilight: "Well, we know a few more things about the Rainbow than we did before. As we know, it was lost at one point.."

K: "Skip over the history lesson." I gently waved a hand.

Twilight: "Alright. I have a feeling, based on the evidence at hand, that the Rainbow of Light, or its source, is in the Kingdom of Harmony - the real one, not the villages Sven and the others were occupying. That means farther north - in the coldest part of North Equus." She nodded a bit.

Rarity: "Indeed, darling. It's the only logical conclusion - our magical jewelry and Twilight's tiara were made using the Rainbow's power, but the Princess Wands from antiquity were the source materials. They were not made from scratch." She gestured, and slid me some of her notes. "According to Megan, she left the Rainbow in the ponies' care when she became an adult, and travel across the Rainbow Bridge became impossible for her. They promsied to take it with them.. and we know that locations have changed in the last ten thousand years."

K: "So. Once this ceremony is over, we go north again. Further north than ever before. Have any expeditions even gone that far?" I gestured.

Fluttershy: "None that we know of. From everything we researched about the area - there's no life up there at all! And it's bitterly cold." She pursed her lips a bit.

Toola Roola: "Best we can figure.. it's that terrible cold that keeps the Rainbow of Light safe. Now, the real problem.." She frowned.

Pinkie: "You're, like, the only person that can use it, K." She sighed. "It requires a human with a pure heart."

K: "Oh! Well, that leaves ME out..!" I side-looked AJ.

Applejack: "Uh? OH!" She turned beet red. "HESH!" And she slapped my ass with her tail. Ow.

Pinkie: *Giggle!* "No, silly! THAAAAAAAAAAT.. doesn't count! It's the pureness you have inside. That.. whole thing about being ready to sacrifice yourself to save everyone. I'm positive that's what's needed!" She grinned.

Toola matched her.

Katrina: "Indeed, K. Based on everything we've read, that's.. that's the most likely theory. And, of course, it won't activate unless you focus, and your emotions are running high - since you don't natively have magic power, it will take a great deal of WILL power to activate it. It's probably much easier for a child - they have pureness and innocence both, no dark thoughts to cloud their minds. Meaning, a human child could use the Rainbow very easily, but as they get older, it becomes harder to do."

Jade: "Mhmm. And that would explain why Megan wasn't able to come here - according to her - very much after she turned 16. After 18, she was afraid of getting trapped here, so she stopped coming." She shrugged.

K: "So. Another expedition in the offing. Admiral?" I looked at Iris.

RADM Iris Emerald: "The Centaur is ready. The Hermes officially launches on the Anniversary. In 200 days, we'll also have a new ship - an Aerobattleship - based on an incomplete hull we found in the Capital's main aeroport. All told, the Aero Fleet will have one Aero Carrier, one Aerobattleship, two Aerocruisers, and two Aerofrigates. Maybe another Aerofrigate or two, depending on how refitment of the Aerodocks at the Capital goes." She shrugged.

Sacquet: "Of course, mon ami, we will be at your side for the expedition to the Rainbow." He nodded.

Havoc: "You'll need us, too. We're Canids - cold weather is our element." He smirked.

Bright Eyes: "And you'll have a fully working and robust air force in one year, General." She slid in, with a pile of charts and things. "Teddy." She nodded to him.

Teddy: "Hey, Bright Eyes." He smirked. "Kinda funny - when we were going to school, I never imagined we'd end up saving the world. Kinda makes me regret being a jerk sometimes.."

Bright Eyes: "All in the past, Teddy." She smiled. "Together, we can help them. And then, maybe, we can bring back part of the past, too." She tilted her head. "It'd be nice to have a game system again, or something."

Starlight: "Yeah." She sighed as well.

K: "If you think about it, there's someone here from each epoch of Ponydom - save Generation 3. Even then, we MET Starsong." I looked at Pinkie. "This is why I know we're going to win - the past and the present are coming together to defeat Tirek. For GOOD, this time. No sealing him away, no turning him to stone. We kill him. We kill him and we make it stick, so nopony, or human, ever has to worry about him ever again." I slapped my hand on the table.

I was given hooves.. first Twilight, then Applejack, then Pinkie, Fluttershy, Toola, Dash, Rarity, Havoc, Katrina, Jade, Sacquet, Gorcat.. everyone piled hands, hooves, and claws into the center of the table, in solemn oath, that Tirek would be put down, no matter what.

For the sake of our future, and pony, griffon, dragon, and other lives yet to come.
