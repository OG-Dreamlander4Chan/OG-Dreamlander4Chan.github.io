December 31, 1011 C.S.
11:00AM, Canterlot Royal Time
Dusk's Apartment

The next morning. Having seen two murders in two days, Trixie was sluggish in waking. Her dreams were littered with terror. That unseen form stalking her. Chasing her.

Dusk slept like a rock. She didn't know how he managed to do it. But, he did. He was already at work. Trixie was more or less under orders not to accept any gigs at any price, given the potential danger to her life. Even Rarity insisted.

Starlight? Ended up at Dusk's place.

Trixie woke up to snaked Starlight making her breakfast.

Trixie: "..eh?!" She sat up, and covered herself, even though she had a tanktop on.

Starlight: "Ah, good morning." She slid over with eggs, bacon, Ambleish (English) Muffins, and cinnamon rolls, setting them on the table next to the couch. "I thought seeing a naked mare with my kind of curves, might cheer you up." She shrugged. "That, and breakfast."

Trixie: "Ah-er-uh!" She blushed, cleared her throat, and crossed her arms, shutting her eyes. "It's not that Trixie hasn't thought about Mares before..!"

Starlight: "Ah-huh." She literally spoon (fork) fed Trixie a piece of bacon. "Eat up, you're skinny as a rail."

Trixie: *Mrpf!* She couldn't deny how good it tasted. "W-Well, you're certainly talented at cooking." She blushed harder.

Starlight: "Mhm. I'd make a great mom." She got up. "Be right back with the coffee."

She walked away, and Trixie couldn't help but look at her.. plump rump. It'd been.. a long time.. since she enjoyed looking at someone other than Dusk. She knew this was more momentary lust than anything, but it was still there.

Starlight came back over with coffee, and Trixie was hard at work, eating.

Trixie: "..I do appreciate this.." She mumbled.

Starlight: "Eh, you're cool." She shrugged. "I know I'm sexy - how do you think I got so many followers?" She smirked. "May as well use it to cheer someone up."

Trixie: "Mmh." She blinked. "What.. DID happen with that?" She looked at her.

Starlight: "Ohh.." She shook her head. "..I was a late bloomer, you know? Real bad. Socially isolated. Lost the one man that I was really into.. childhood sweethearts and all.." She sighed. "..and when it all went wrong, it went really wrong. I was basically an outcast in school, you know? It was really bad. So, when I graduated, I decided I was going to do something SO impressive, he'd HAVE to notice. AND!" She flicked her hair and bounced her boobs a bit. "Make a place where everyone was truly equal - none of that Herdiet socialism fake equality stuff." She shrugged. "So, I ended up with a magic staff that could remove Cutie Marks." She nodded. "Some strange man gave it to me." She dismissively flicked her hand. "Then, the Royal Guard intervened and I got arrested for running a cult and misuse of Magic." She lifted her bangs to show the Restrictor that was back on her horn.

Trixie: "That sucks." She frowned. "Men can be such trouble."

Starlight: "Right? So... the court put a restrictor on me, I turned evidence on other baddies that had approached me and such, and I got probation and court-ordered psych time." She sighed.

Trixie: "Eh. Could've been a lot worse." She finished the muffin.

Starlight: "Yep." She nodded. "Then G-Man came into my life. I like him." She smiled. "I know he's engaged and all, but.." She shrugged. "..I kinda wanna tease Rarity, now that I know her." She smiled and leaned in a bit. "Nothing mean or REALLY bad, but.." She shrugged. "..so, how is he in bed?"

Trixie: "Starlight!" She blushed. "Well, if you MUST know..."


12:01PM
Nightwatch Headquarters


Dusk was moving around the office space, near empty with all the stuff that's been happening. He had a file on the latest murder, and some research materials he'd dug out of the archive. Something didn't sit right with him, about these murders. Astral was behind him with some books on psychology.

Astral: "When did the Nightwatch become the government's dirty job cops?" She smirked.

Dusk: "Eh, it's needed, we have talent, and we have a reputation." He shrugged. "Better we handle it, I suppose."

Astral: "Makes sense." She nodded.

Dusk: "Besides, the Tactical Teams are specialized for counter-terrorism and organized threats. We have eight of those with ten Watchers each, and a Support Troop of 40. Plus, the two Guard Companies of 120 Watchers each that pull special protection duties." He shrugged. "Really, we have 360 front liners. All smart, educated, and well trained. If we all worked together on big threats like this, we could keep a better lid on them." He nodded.

Astral: "And the Royal Guard is a full battalion - over a thousand - but they're mainly for important raids and things that local police can't handle." She shrugged. "Celestia's Solar Guard are mainly palace protection and close protection for her and her sister."

Dusk: "Right. And the Royal Guard isn't specialized in things like we are. Each Tac Team has a combination of specialists, and the two Guard Companies are cross trained in different things." He gestured. "The Solar Guard are literally only for protection duties. They don't even investigate threats and tips - we have been. Honestly, I think we should add another Company detail specialized in threat intelligence gathering, what with everything going on. At the very least, Watchers that can spot Changelings and Changeling activity easily." He shook is head.

Astral: "You still think they'll try again?" She tilted her head.

Dusk: "I do." He shrugged.


1:22PM
Khyangatown, Canterlot


In keeping with Khyangese tradition, the Songs' funeral was today - an auspicious day, being New Year's Eve on the Celestian calendar. While not a specifically auspicious day to the Khyangese, the Songs had many friends that weren't. Since they had no direct relatives here, the leader of the local Moodist (Buddhist) temple handled the arrangements.

Trixie was attending. Mainly because she knew Mae Song fairly well - to the point that they'd gotten into shenanigans when they were younger. Park, her dad, never really approved of Trixie's bad influence, but loved her as a customer. He kept hoping Mae's more conservative upbringing would wear off on Trixie.

She reflected on this - they weren't just her favorite restaurateurs, but acquaintances... friends. Seeing them killed in that manner.. Trixie didn't know how to put it out of her head, but she would.

She had no idea that someone else was here. Someone was watching her. As the procession passed her, though, she would become aware.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "Interesting culture, isn't it?" She said in low tones.

Trixie about jumped out of her skin.

Trixie: "Ack! Y-You again!" She pointed. "Don't DO that! You're the one who said I should be careful, and there you go sneaking up on me!"

Dr. Moon Dancer: "Sorry." She shrugged. "I came to see who'd show up. If I'm right, this type of individual would be very eager to see this - revel in the destruction they've caused."

Trixie: "..makes sense, I guess.." She frowned.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "Watch yourself." She nodded, and slid back into the crowd.

Trixie: *Mutters* "The Great and Powerful Trixie can handle herself." She crossed her arms, and turned her attention back to the parade.

The procession of mourning finished with the arrival at the local temple. Trixie slid along the street, to watch, and pay her respects.

Just as she passed an alley, she heard someone scream. She turned to look, and just barely avoided someone trying to knife her. Trixie screamed at the top of her lungs, causing everyone to look, and as she fell backwards, she looked to see who it was.. only.. they were gone.


1:47PM


The police arrived and took a report. Dr. Moon Dancer had caught sight of someone in the alley, too, but couldn't get a description of them at all, they'd been too far away. Dusk arrived to take Trixie home.

Dusk: "I want you under guard at all times, until this person is caught." He nodded.

Trixie: "..fine." She hugged herself.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "I did warn you. Seems I was right." She nodded. "They'll be after you."

Trixie: "Trixie DOES NOT like being a target!" She hissed.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "No, no one does." She shrugged.

Dusk: "I'll make sure there's a guard at the apartment once I go back to HQ." He nodded.

Officer Thunderlane: "I'll do it, Dusk." He shrugged.

Dusk: "Thanks, Lane." He nodded to him.

Thunderlane had been a couple years behind them in school, and had been a football player. Darn good Defensive Tackle, too. They knew him, and they trusted him.

Officer Thunderlane: "I'll get Cherry Coke to relieve me later." He shrugged.

Dusk: "Sounds good. Come on, Trixie." He patted her shoulders, and escorted her to his car.

This was getting serious. Dusk knew he needed to find this creep and fast, or Trixie might end up dead. He.. couldn't bear the idea. He needed to find this perp, fast.

Getting back to his place, he ordered pizza on the way, so Trixie didn't have to leave the apartment for the time being. Things were so messed up. He was worried, but he couldn't let it detract him from his duty.

Once back to his place, he saw that Starlight was.. here. Naked. Watching TV.

Dusk: *Sigh* "Starlight..." He covered his eyes.

Thunderlane: "OH MY!" He quickly looked away.

Trixie: "Still naked?" She shrugged.

Starlight: "Oh! Guests." She got up, and pulled her shorts on, then threw a shirt on over her bosom. "There, boys, better?" She dripped that with honey.

Thunderlane: "Y-Yeah.." He cleared his throat.

Dusk: "No more nudity at my place!" He said somewhat sternly.

Starlight: "Oh, you love it and you know it." She sassed back.

Thunderlane didn't know WHAT to think - he knew Dusk was getting married, to Rarity. He knew that him and Trixie were on and off.. but a third girl? He just ribbed Dusk, and gave him a wink and a grin.

Dusk: "...it's not like that, Lane." He chuckled, though.

Thunderlane: "Uh, okay, man, but say.. you ever need a hand-" He snickered.

Dusk: "No!" He thumped his shoulder. "No, no. Just.." He waved both hands, dismissively. "..watch 'em."

Thunderlane: "Suuuuuuuuuuuure!" He gave him a wolfish grin.

Trixie and Starlight were giggling in the background.

Dusk: "LANE! Not like thaaaat!" He made a sour face.

Thunderlane: "Phrasing, dude.." He patted his shoulder "..nah, I got this." He stood at a ready at-ease position on the outside of the front door. "I'll keep her safe, don't worry." He smiled a bit.

Trixie: "Are you.. suuure you want to leave me alone?" She immediately went and draped herself a bit over Starlight, and winked at him. They both made a lil' moan, to tease the two males.

Everyone laughed.

Dusk: "Yeah, yeah, you watch it." He wagged a finger at them. "I'll be back this evening." He shrugged.

With that, and another wolfish wink-and-grin from Thunderlane, Dusk departed. He was.. in a good mood after this. Despite the scary situation, he felt like he'd be able to overcome it. He had friends, and more than that, he had confidence his friends would be able to handle this.

He decided to stop at Joe's for donuts and coffee before getting back to HQ. After all, Astral could probably use a lift. He also needed to stop off at the Canterlot PD and pick up some files from Dr. Dancer.


3:38PM
Nightwatch Headquarters


The time at the Canterlot PD was well spent. He talked to Dr. Dancer's assistant, Forensic Technician Bitta Luck. She specialized in insectology, and could determine a lot of things just by the presence of insects and eggs - she did make it clear that Button Mash had been dead a while before he was found, given the presence of fly eggs on his entrails.

He asked around if Moon Dancer had anything else. Candy Cane, one of the other lab techs, emphasized that the killer had been apparently very skilled, and knowledgeable about anatomy, for them to have done what they did, how they did it.

When Dusk arrived at HQ, he could tell it was the holidays. One Guard outside, one at the Desk (Misty), and almost no one else here. Tonight was New Year's. So, back to Astral's office he went.

Astral was elbow deep in files. She was looking up things, reading through everything they had, and more. She seemed to have some kind of a lead, judging by the level of piles she had going.

Dusk: "On to something?" He leaned in, sliding her a coffee.

Astral: "Kinda? I mean.. I found out there was something like this in Coltago a few years ago." She shrugged, showing him a few news articles. "They never found out who did it, but three people were murdered in 1004. The Coltago Police didn't think anything of it, they didn't even suspect they were linked. One was a restaurateur, one was a worker at a magazine shop, and the third one was a police officer." She frowned.

Dusk: "Odd. Why do YOU think-" It clicked for him immediately - the first two murders there, match the first two here. "..aha."

Astral: "Exactly. Soooooooo..." She shrugged. "..we just need to find the link between Coltago and Canterlot. Some person that was in both places at the right times."

Dusk: "That's not exactly easy. They're both very big cities. Did the Coltago PD find any evidence?" He tilted his head.

Astral: "I'm not sure. We don't have a record of it, but I did find the detective assigned to the case - Mystery Wraps. Here's her phone number." She handed him a slip of paper.

Dusk: "Ah, alright." He took it. "I'll see if they're on duty today." With that, he went to his own office.

Sitting down with his own coffee, he spotted a couple of files from Dr. Moon Dancer. He decided to look through them as he pulled the phone over and pulled the receiver, sticking it in the crook of his neck, as he dialed the number.

Operator: P> "Coltago Police Department, Central Switchboard, Officer Pegs speaking, how may I direct your call?"

Dusk: P> "Altern Dusk Seeker, Nightwatch. I'm looking for Detective Mystery Wraps? I have an incident here of national security matters, and I need to speak to them right away." He thumbed through the files.

Operator/Officer Pegs: P> "Yes, the Serious Crimes division isn't on duty today. I'll call her desk for you and see if she's in. If not, I'll transfer you to Personnel so you can get her personal number."

Dusk: P> "That'll do. Thank you." He opened the file about the Songs.

He waited for a bit, as the transfer rang through.

Sgt. Lank Vote: P> "Serious Crimes Division, Sergeant Lank Vote." His voice was very deep, very gravelly, and his Coltago accent was very apparent.

Dusk: P> "Altern Dusk Seeker, Nightwatch. I'm looking for Detective Mystery Wraps." He was casually reading the Songs' file.

Sgt. Vote: P> "Oh, yeah, just a sec." Dusk could hear him put his hand over the phone and shout 'HEY MISSY LINE TWO'. "Jus' a sec." He could hear Vote put the line on hold.

Det. Wraps: P> "Dahtective Wraps." Her voice was very deeply accented, dismissive, and almost sarcastic.

Dusk: P> "Altern Seeker, Nightwatch. I'm asking about a series of murders from 1004." He shrugged. "We've got some similar murders happening up here. Two, so far, and we're looking for any information you might have."

Det. Wraps: P> "Oh! Oh, those. Yeah. Gimme sec." She could be heard looking through some papers, then opening a filing cabinet. "..y'know, you really oughtta ask the forensic team about this. They knew more than I did. I jes' ran down some leads, interviewed witnesses, you know. We don't usually GET bad crimes like that, but... Really, the murders were kinda strange all around. They kept saying they were all the same person - but that don't make much sense. Why would one person kill multiple people?"

Dusk: P> "A Serial Killer with a motive." He stated.

Det. Wraps: P> "A serial killer? Like Jacknife the Ripper? We haven't.. that's silly!" She chuckled a bit, then paused, then pulled out a file as she was talking. "Here it is. The forensic team's notes." She started flipping through them. "Yeah, they kept saying it was one person that did all of these. I interviewed everyone connected to the victims." She sighed. "I didn't really find a link."

Dusk: P> "What about the murdered officer?" He read through the method that the Songs were killed - a sharp object, like a knife or a scalpel or something, cut their throats, then they were stabbed with one of their own carving knives.

Det. Wraps: P> "They were one of our crime scene techs, actually." She sighed. "I r'member Dr. Dancer was tore u-"

Dusk: P> "Doctor Moon Dancer?" He interrupted.

Det. Wraps: P> "Yeah! She was our lead forensic expert."

Dusk: P> "..were the murders committed with knives?" He flipped to the report about Button Mash.. same thing.. he was cut open with a very sharp object, like a knife or scalpel.

Det. Wraps: P> "Yeah, all three of them." She said offhand. "The guy at the Khyangese restaurant was sliced open along the neck, but it didn't kill him. Dr. Dancer said it'd take a unicorn with a lot of practice to do it like that-"

Dusk: P> "Did Dr. Dancer frequent that restaurant, or the magazine store?" He had to know.. no, there was no way..


4:22PM
Dusk's Apartment


Thunderlane was chilling, sitting in a folding chair with a magazine that Trixie had given him. Absolutely nothing had happened. As he expected. Cherry Coke would be there in less than an hour to relieve him, too, so, he wasn't too worried. Trixie had fed him, too, so he was in a pretty good mood when Dr. Dancer arrived.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "Officer." She nodded.

Thunderlane: "Ma'am." He nodded.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "Trixie's here, right?" She tilted her head.

Thunderlane: "Yeah." He nodded. "It's just her and me. Starlight - friend'a hers - left about an hour ago."

Dr. Moon Dancer: "Good. I wanted to see if she recalled anything about her attacker. It should be about time for her mind to clear up." She shrugged.

Thunderlane: "Oh, yeah." He got up and knocked. "Trixie? It's Lane - Doc Dancer is here."

Trixie: "Oh, come in." She said, getting to the door, unlocking it, and opening it. "Come on in, Lane, get a soda."

Thunderlane: "Don't mind if I do." He smiled, and entered.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "So, tell me, Trixie, do you remember anything about your attacker?" She tilted her head.

Trixie: "Well.. I kinda remember there being a glow.. I think they were a unicorn." She tilted her head, and her phone vibrated in her pocket.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "As I've been saying all along." She shrugged.

Trixie: "When they tried to stab me.. I remember.. it didn't look like a knife.. it.." She frowned, and casually reached her hand into her pocket for her phone. "..and they were about my height, a little taller.. maybe your height?"

She looked at the single message.

{Text Message: Dusk (3:27)} - TRIXIE GET OUT AND GET TO RARITYS. DANCER IS THE KILLER.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "Yeah." She smiled a bit, and saw Trixie's facial reaction. "You know, funny thing. That's the problem with a high trust society..." Her arm came down, and a scalpel came out. With a vicious, furious motion, she stabbed Thunderlane in the stomach, and pulled the blade across his belly, folding him in half. "...NO MATTER.. how hard.. I try to get caught.."

Thunderlane fell, groaning, in pain, as blood poured from his stomach. As she saw this, Trixie dropped her phone, screamed, and fell back on her ass.

Trixie: "YOU!? WHY!? WHYYYY?!" She screamed at her.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "I have my reasons." She advanced slowly on Trixie with the scalpel now levitated. "Oh, I'm going to have FUN with your body.." She drizzled out, her eyes flashing green. "..I think I'll shove some flash powder in your throat and.. blow your head clean off. That'll be a nice trick.." She giggled madly. "Maybe throw some glitter on your hands, too! Oh, SO.. MANY.. CHOICES..!"

Panic. This woman was CRAZY! Trixie could see how mad she was, how she could enjoy.. killing.. it made her sick. Reacting to her advances, Trixie scooted back on her ass, trying to get some distance. What.. what can she do?! She needed time to think..

Trixie: "W-Why kill the Songs?! WHY? THEY WERE GOOD PEOPLE!" She scream-cried at her.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "They took the Pupu Platter off the menu. The one item I liked. I know.. they did it.." Her voice got vicious. "..JUST TO SPITE ME."

The Scalpel took a slash at Trixie, only for her to block it with a couch cushion, which was gouged open. Dancer yanked it out of Trixie's grasp with her Telekinesis Magic.. it was shockingly strong.

Trixie: "W-What about that kid from the game store?! HE WAS JUST A KID!" She shouted at her.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "HE DELIBERATELY.. DELIBERATELY.. SOLD THE LAST COPY OF 'FUMENKO SAMURAI GAME GIRL' WHEN HE KNEW I WANTED IT!" She screeched at the top of her lungs. "THEY'RE ALL OUT TO SPITE ME! ALL OF THEM!"

The Scalpel slashed downwards again, and Trixie managed to roll out of the way. She came up next to the couch, and her mind was racing. She had to get out of there. She had to escape. Something.

She scrambled over towards the front door, but Dusk's TV flew from the wall, and nearly hit her. She screeched again, and fired an Impact spell at it, sending it flying back at Moon Dancer.

Moon Dancer avoided it, and.. then she pulled several MORE scalpels from her pocket.. and launched them at Trixie, one after another, with the speed of a machine gun.

Trixie threw up a shield, and dove back towards the bedroom. She felt one Scalpel hit her in the ass, and as she shoved her way through the bedroom door, she reached back and yanked it out. It hurt, but the damage wasn't critical.

Trixie: "Gun.. gun.." She slid for the bed, and just as she had her hand on Dusk's pistol case, her ankle was grabbed by Moon Dancer's Telekinesis magic, and she was pulled back. "YOU BITCH!"

Trixie found herself pulled all the way out of the room, and on her back, looking up at Moon Dancer.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "Mmmmm.. such sporty prey. It's a shame I have to kill you!" She giggled, madly, insanely. "You've been SO MUCH FUN!" She screeched.

As the Scalpel came down, Trixie used her own magic to redirect it, then fired a Sparkle Blast to Moon Dancer's face. Little more than colorful stage magic, it none the less blinded her a moment, making her lose concentration, and allowing Trixie to scramble away.

She crawled over to the kitchen, where Thunderlane was.. she found him, trying to pull his service pistol from his holster.. he was still alive! Bleeding horribly, but still alive. Oh, she hoped he could hold on.

Thunderlane: "T-Take... it... uhhh..." He slid it across the tile to her.

Trixie got her hands on it, just as her ankle was grabbed again. She flicked the safety off, rolled over on her back as she was pulled, and blindly fired three shots at Moon Dancer.

Moon Dancer both erected a magic shield to blunt the rounds, AND dodged to the side, landing on her right shoulder.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "OH THAT'S NOT FAIR!" She screeched. "GUNS!? YOU LITTLE BRAT! YOU STAGE WHORE! NO CHEATING!"

Trixie: "Yeah!? FUCK YOU!" She screamed at her, as she dove on one leg back towards the rear of the apartment, aiming for the bathrooms - she knew the window there led to the fire escape, and freedom.

She didn't expect Moon Dancer to heft THE WHOLE COUCH and try to launch it down the hallway. It got lodged at the opening to the hallway, though, and wedged there.. ironic, that couch had so many memories, and it was like it was trying to protect her, now.

That gave Trixie room to run to the bathroom, and go for the window. She used her horn telekinesis to FORCE it open as fast as possible, and dove out, getting to the Fire Escape. She decided to go UP instead of DOWN, though. Because she knew she could get to the building next to it, and escape that way. Plus, the building next door had a few Guards that lived there, she knew, and they might be able to help her.

She also hard sirens in the distance.

Dusk was coming. Help was coming. She just had to play for time. Even if she couldn't kill Moon Dancer or stop her, herself.. she had friends coming.

She got to the roof, and could hear Moon Dancer chasing her, trying to catch up. Trixie scrambled across the roof, running over the gravel, and trying to keep her distance. Moon Dancer crested the edge of the roof just as Trixie managed to hide behind an HVAC blower.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "Wheeerrrreee aaaareee.. youuuu..?" She trilled, crazily. "Our game time is almost over..." She sounded sad, almost. "..your friends will be here soon. And I need you DEAD!" She yelled.

Trixie didn't want to make any noise at all. She didn't want to try and run across the roof, now, if Moon Dancer was stalking her.. she just kept her eyes open, and looking all around, straining her hears to listen for the crunch of gravel under foot.. she could hear the crazy bitch.. getting closer.. closer..

Suddenly, Trixie burst out from behind the ventilation machine, and ran for the far side of the roof, where the gate to the next building was. She knew it was never locked. She got her hand on the handle, just as another scalpel hit her, cut through her upper right arm, caused her to drop the gun, and pinned her to the metal of the gate frame.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "AND NOW! CURTAINS, FOR THE GREAT AND POWERFUL STAGE WHORE!" She laughed uncontrollably.

*GUNSHOT!*

Moon Dancer fell forwards, and as she did, Trixie saw Dusk standing there, with his own handgun in a two-hand grip, barrel slightly smoking. He raised his head from aim, and smiled.

Dusk: "Sorry I'm late." He walked over to where she was, and yanked the scalpel out of Trixie's arm - it only hit the edge of the arm, and hadn't seriously damaged her, though it'd leave a scar, probably.

Trixie: "OH DUSK!" She fell into his arms and hugged him.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "URgh.." She groaned, and rolled over. "YOU FUCK!" She yelled.

Trixie: "FUCK YOU!" She hissed.

Dusk: "You're under arrest, D-" He was about to finish his sentence, but he was buffallo'd by a huge magic impact spell that sent both of them flying.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "YOU. CAN'T. KILL. ME. THAT. EASY!" She screamed.

When they rolled over, they could see that Moon Dancer did indeed have a hole in her shoulder, low, almost over the heart but not quite. She was bleeding, but she was also LEVITATING, with green energy surrounding her.

Dusk: "OH WHAT THE HELL!?!" He rolled over, having grabbed and held on to Trixie as they rolled along the ground. Looking over, he saw her, in all her green glowing glory. "What.. how..? What the-"

Dr. Moon Dancer: "Surprised?" She smiled. "You.. WORMS have NO IDEA how much POWER that I REALLY HAVE!" She sneered at them.

Trixie: "What'd you do to GET that power?!" She freed herself from Dusk, got to her feet, and started backing up.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "Simple." She smirked. "Replacing the real Moon Dancer." And shrugged. "I can take a pony's memories.." She extended her hand. "..and everything else." She gently cocked a brow.

Dusk: "Yeah, and her obsessions." He realized he didn't have his gun... but he does have his combat knife.

Dr. Moon Dancer: "THESE ARE MY OBSESSIONS." She screamed. "I'm the one that likes Khyangese food! I'm the one that likes Anime! THE ONLY THING SHE LIKED WAS BOOKS." She twitched. "She.. was boring.. loser.. total loser.." She shook her head. "..you ponies are so stupid. AND YOU! STAGE WHORE! I HATE YOU! YOU WASTE MAGIC ON THE STUPIDEST THINGS!" She summoned up green energy bolts. "No wonder it's been so easy. I left you bread crumbs, lots of them, and you.. JUST..!" She fired several of them, making Trixie and Dusk dodge out of the way and summon Magic Shields themselves. "..DON'T!" More bolts, and Dusk quickly got his knife out. "..GET IT!"

Dusk summoned a telekinetic 'push' spell, and charged it to his knife.

Dusk: "THINK FAST, BITCH!" He yelled as he telekinetically 'threw' his knife. With a flick of his arm, he fired it at the speed of a bullet towards her neck. It hit, she fell, and landed on the roof.

Trixie came up by him, and they both fetched the two guns on the roof, before approaching her, as Astral arrived on the roof with a Tactical Team made up of.. whomever she could get her hands on. Canterlot PD SWAT was right behind them.

The thing is, she was still alive.

Entity: "You.. you'll never.. understand us.." She grabbed the knife in her throat, it'd impacted just to the right of her esophagus. "..you will fall." She stared blankly at them both, her energy sapping, her life force slipping away.

Dusk: "Understand who?" He said, weapon aimed at her. "What are you?"

Entity: "What do you think?" She smirked, and as she died, changed back into what she used to be - a Changeling.

Astral: "...well, shit." She ran up, and nodded to Dusk and Trixie. "NEED A MEDIC OVER HERE!" She pointed to Trixie. "You okay, Dusk?"

Dusk: "Yeah, I am.." He frowned. "..do Changelings become their own person after a while...?" He cocked a brow.

Astral: "I have no idea." She shrugged.

Sgt. Spirit Ebonwave: "Nothing serious, boss. She should get stitches, though." He shrugged, having bandaged Trixie's wound.

Trixie: "One thing's for sure." She frowned. "They can sure go crazy." She growled.

Dusk: "What was her goal? Why the murders? Was it to test us..?" He shrugged. "Eh. I'll worry about that tomorrow." He frowned.


TIME: 11:55PM
Astral's Apartment


Starlight, Trixie, Rarity, Dusk, and Astral were all here. Dusk's place was a mess. He'd cleaned most of it up, but the rest would have to wait until tomorrow some time. In the meanwhile, Astral offered for everyone to get drunk and pass out at her place.

Which is precisely what everyone was doing.

Thunderlane was saved before he bled out, and the doctors gave him a good chance at a full recovery. The damage had mostly been surface level, but did cut through his abs a bit. It was a good thing the scalpel that cut him, wasn't much longer.

Rarity: "Goodness, darling..." She slurred. "..I am.. positively.. plastered." She hiccupped, and giggled.

Starlight: "Ehhh.. you weaklings.. can't hold your booze, can'ya?" She snickered. "Mmm.. Rarity.. you know, you got a nice ass." She licked her lips.

Astral: "HAH!" She chuckled.

Dusk: "At least we made it to New Year's." He sighed, smiling. "Mmmm... gonna sleep in tomorrow, for sure." He said, laying on the couch, in just jeans and a tank top.

Rarity slid over, clumsily, and straddled him.

Rarity: "Mmh.." She ran her hands over his chest. "D'you.. have any.. idea.. darling.. what it takes for me to resist you?" She bit her lip.

Trixie: "You kiddin'? He never needs booze to get him going." She snark-giggled, then laughed. "All it takes is a good kiss!"

Rarity: "REALLY, now?" She smirked.

Astral: "Countdown." She stated, looking at the TV.

Five.. four.. three.. two... one..!

And at the stroke of Midnight, Dusk was dove upon, with Rarity meeting his lips with singular focus, and sheer, horny will. She slid her arms around his neck, dove her sweet mint-tasting tongue into his mouth... and reminded him WHY they were getting married.

His little soldier sure got the message! But, after that whole day of terror and fear, and the alcohol, he just couldn't do very much about it. He laid there, let her make out with him, and when she was done, he smiled up at her.

Dusk: "You know? I love you." He let out a long breath.

Rarity: "I love you, too, my darling." She did likewise, and curled up on top of him.

As Dusk drifted off into a drunken slumber, his mind was still poked by the things the entity pretending to be Moon Dancer said. What its motivations were. Why it was doing all this. It didn't make sense to him.

But, that was Tomorrow Dusk's problem.
