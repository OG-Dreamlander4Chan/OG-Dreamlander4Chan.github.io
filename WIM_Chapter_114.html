Part 1: Waiting in Being

TIME: 08:22 NCT
DATE: War Day 907/2 Decemus, 1004 C.S. (Local)
LOCATION: Tanjungpinang, Riau Islands, Dutch East Indies


I was having breakfast. Teeka was across from me, smiling a million miles wide. Sunset was to my right, Lightning Dust to my left, with Steela next to her, and Laus across from Steela.

My little team.

K: "Got a message from Neighpon last night." I pulled out the paper. "The 1st Combined Fleet is on its way and is expected by late on the 6th. They didn't say WHAT they're bringing, but Emperor no Ken promised 12 Regiments of ground troops. Travel time is expected to be five days. They have coilers with the fleet - they'll have to refuel once, just past the half way mark. That'll cost them about a day."

Lightning Dust: "That's only four days. What, was he ready for this?" She shrugged her wings.

K: "Apparently. Not for THIS, exactly, but he was about to take the 1st Combined Fleet and the entire 1st Division to Europe and Equestria for combined arms training. He just cut some of the troop ships, so he'd have enough fuel to get here." I gestured a bit.

Laus: "Mm." He nodded. "Hopefully he brings a solid fleet. Like I told you, there's three combat fleets in the Islands, and each Fleet has three Battleships, twelve Cruisers, and twelve Destroyers. At least one fleet will spearhead the assault on Tanjungpinang." A shrug.

K: "The Equestrian Fleet will be here in 12 days. Ambleon is headed this way as well. Apparently, Starlight managed to get through to the Princess of the Neigtherlands.. they're sending their own fleet. But that'll be a bit, too. They'd actually already dispatched a relief force - now, they're getting ready to send everything else they have." I shrugged a bit, and had some of the eggs. "They'll be here almost at the same time as Neighpon. Several hours difference, maybe a day."

Steela: "And Laus has said they will invade in three days?" She nodded to him.

Laus: "It's going to be tight. No two ways about it." He nodded a bit, then looked down. "..thanks again."

K: "When this war is over, you can help your people stand up for peace." I nodded to him. "Your status as a veteran, someone that's seen the horror of war, will influence people."

Lightning: "We can do it." She nodded firmly.

K: "We'll have to. Once the fight starts, we can't run anywhere." I shrugged.

About then, Kolonel Wolfheze came in with Majoor Goossens.

K. Wolfheze: "Kolonel K." He nodded to me. "I see the defenses are as good as we can make them."

K: "We still have to get the last two guns off of Java. I'd like to see if we have time to move her 25 and 40 millimeter guns, too. Put those in fixed positions near the last line of defense." I shrugged. "40mm is plenty for lightly armored vehicles, and 25mm will devastate their infantry."

Maj. Goossens: "Indeed. We reassigned Java's crew as replacements elsewhere in the fleet. Kapitan Cornelis is now first officer of Utrecht. Thought you might want to know." He smiled a bit.

K: "I like him. VERY good officer. Good leader. I.." I looked down. "..if this was Equestria, I'd give him his own ship again, after this."

K. Wolfheze: "Should we survive, I will advise it." He smirked, then grew serious. "You know more about this. What can we expect?"

K: "30-45% casualties, and a lot of hard fighting if they get in close. The biggest issue we have is that your rifles are not fully automatic, and we're going to be fighting numbers. I understand WHY you didn't make them that way, but the situation is what it is. We'll probably lose the first two defensive lines and be fought back to the city - as I said, we need to prepare for that. Defense-in-depth. Cause casualties, fall back, encircle, cause more casualties until they break through, then fall back again. We start at those beaches on the outer islets, then the beaches on the main island, then the city itself. Once we fall back to the final line, it's all or nothing." I gestured, finishing my toast.

Maj. Goossens: "And the sea?" He looked up.

K: "Depends if we can sucker their battleships with Torpedoes. In a gun battle, we're completely outmatched. And they have submarines now. If they're smart and forward deploy them, we're in trouble, since we have neither Sonar nor Depth Charges. I did manage to assemble a hydrophone set, and the local workshops are duplicating them, but.." I shrugged. "..that and basic timed fuse TNT barrels are not ideal."

K. Wolfheze: "Are Tirek's battleships equals to ours?" He shrugged.

K: "They're as good technologically. Gun power.. we've observed them with 12.6-inch (320mm) guns. Just barely what a truly modern Battleship would have. That'll wreck any ship of ours we have, if they hit. And they have three of them. Likely with three dual turrets each. The naval gunfire support for those alone would be devastating - if we see them, we have to be able to SNAKE them before they start shooting shore targets. We're totally outnumbered, so, as soon as the scouts find them, we have to strike, and strike hard. Sink or damage-out-of-action whatever we can LONG before they get into range." I shrugged. "It's the best we can hope for. Our objective is to delay them for up to 48 hours. Whatever we can score, is icing on the cake." I looked at Wolfheze directly. "Your subordinate officers need to be on their A-Game. This will come down to how each Platoon, each Squad fights. Better review the junior officers and make sure they're prepared. Mentally."

K. Wolfheze: "A good idea." He nodded, and then side-nodded to the door for Goossens to follow. "I presume you'll be doing the same?"

K: "Today, I want to check the defenses around the city itself, and see if there's anything I'm missing, or that we're missing." I shrugged. "That and maybe do a few quick patrols for Infiltrators."

Maj. Goossens: "You never rest on your laurels, huh?" He smirked.

K: "..there are too many of you counting on me to do my absolute best. I can't afford to." I nodded to him.

K. Wolfheze: "We are learning how dedicated you are. I see now why NEIGHTO trusts you." He nodded, and they departed.

As I said I would, my team - now with Laus instead of Korporaal Dunne - were searching for infiltrators. It wasn't a big team, it wasn't my best soldiers, but I trusted them.

After all, even Teeka accepted Laus. And Teeka was undyingly loyal to me.

K: "MMmm.. should be a village near here." I pointed up the road. "Stay alert. Sneaking in saboteurs is a big Tirek strategy." I nodded.

Laus: "No kidding." He hefted the Radio Pack on his back, and let his Zhukov dangle on its strap. "I mean, I don't know for certain - we weren't told details like that - but I'd guess at least another team or two. Probe for weaknesses, sabotage things, cause trouble.."

Lighning Dust: "Inflict terror." She nodded. "Whatever it is, we can take'em."

K: "Let's not get cocky." I reminded them. "Remember, we're all we have right now."

Lightning Dust: "No problem." She nodded a bit. "I have to admit, I.." She shrugged a bit. "..sometimes I do act without thinking. The engine? Yeah, I could've blown us all up with that."

Sunset: "Hey, it worked." She reassured her. "War's about risk. Managed. Risk."

Lightning Dust: "No kidding." She hefted a sigh.

Laus: "Hey, up ahead." He pointed to the next rise in the softly rolling terrain. "Looks like an injured foal."

Teeka: "Oh noes-es!" She frowned.

Maud: "..cover me." She stated flatly.

We all did, advancing carefully. We found the young colt with a bullet wound in his front right shoulder. It looked deep enough - there was a lot of blood. Maud started treating him immediately.

K: "How's he look?" I asked.

Maud: "..it isn't mortal, if that's what you mean." She blinked twice as she worked quickly.

Laus: "Blood trail leads from the village, boss." He frowned.

K: "Radio." I nodded.

Laus handed it over, as I watched the village.

K: C> "Bravo Alpha Actual to Central. We have a possible Code Red at the village north-north-west of the city. Requesting QRF." I called it in.

Central Command Radiopony: "Roger! QRF enroute!"

Sunset: "Spread out a bit, and get some cover." She nodded, moving behind a rock.

Lightning Dust: "Right behind ya." She moved to the other side of Maud and the Road.

Teeka and Laus stayed by Maud. I moved over closer to Sunset, as she was kinda hanging free.

K: "See anything?" I nodded to the Village.

Sunset: "No movement at all. I have no idea. They might be all dead." She shrugged.

K: "We need to find out." I nodded. "We'll wait for the Dutch Marines to get here." I looked at LD.

Lightning Dust: "Y-Yeah." She nodded twice.

Maud: "The child will live." She nodded exactly once. "When the Marines arrive, he will need to be sent to the hospital."

Teeka: "No worry, Colt." She sat next to him. "You be fine. Teeka here. Teeka protect." She smiled a bit.

About thirty minutes later, the QRF showed up. The Marine officer, Lt. Horloge, moved up to me at a somewhat low crawl.

Lt. Horloge: "Kolonel. What you need us?" He nodded.

K: "The village ahead. Might be casualties, might be trouble. Lots of trouble. We're going to advance rapidly, have your MG cover the advance. We take the strucutres by the numbers. Use caution, we don't know what's there." I pointed to the village as I spoke.

Lt. Horloge: "Ja, Kolonel." He motioned to his platoon, and they got ready.

K: "We advance fast. Teeka, Maud, stay here. Everyone else, on me." I motioned. "Go, go, go!"

Lt. Horloge: "Vooruit!" He ordered.

And over the dune we went. Not sure of what we'd find, but dreading what we might see.

Part 2: Village Violence

TIME: 11:02 NCT
DATE: War Day 907/2 Decemus, 1004 C.S. (Local)
LOCATION: 5km from Tanjungpinang, Bintan Island, Dutch East Indies

K: "Advance! Move!" I pushed soldiers ahead of me, moving to the far left, closest to the beach side, looking for an escape boat.

What I ran into was a Porcine Warrior that looked nothing like the normal ones. Like.. I slapped face first into his belly as I turned a corner.

Porcine(?): "WATCH IT!" He backhanded me. "HUUUMAN!" And drew a wicked.. machete.. thing.

K: "Hi!" I landed flat on my ass, and as he swung, I brought the Carbine up to block, only for the machete to crash through it, and almost ME.

Luck with me, the Machete had lost enough velocity that it merely brusied my ribcage. This gave me an opening to fast draw my Dager from my thigh holster, aim low as he reared back for another swing, and fire five shots into his right hip.

Only problem is, he bellyflopped on me. HE WEIGHS A TON! HOLY FUCKING SHIT!

K: "GET OFF ME!" I screamed. "STEEEEEEEELAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!"

Porcine: "Fuggin' hurt you..!" He grappled with me, four porky digits interlocking with my five, as he kept trying to gouge my eyes out, or get his hands over my face.

Steela: "RRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
She screamed at the top of her lungs, and HEAD-BUTT RAMMED that thing off of me.

The Porcine went flying.

That thing had to weigh at least 500 pounds.

She rammed it and sent it flying like a medicine ball. Then lept into the air, and came crashing down on it, still wielding the fire axe from the Java, and sank the axe into its neck so deeply, she nearly decapitated the thing.

I scooted back and counted my limbs, making sure they all worked.

K: "Holy.." *Pant* "..fuck!"

Sunset: "KAY!" She charged over and covered the monster with her Kreuger.

Steela: "Is dead!" She wrenched the axe out, kicked it in the face, and spat on it.

K: "Thanks, Steela!" I shook my head, still trying to catch my breath, and feeling like a rolled up tube of toothpaste. "That fucker talked!" I pointed at it. "And look at its face!"

Sunset: "..yeah, that does look off." She furrowed her brow. "Come on, we'll worry about it later." She helped me up.

K: "Yeah." Down to my pistol for now, I moved in a walking Weaver stance towards the beach.

There were five longboats here, and there were guards. Heavy Raptorians, six of them.

Steela: "Scouting party?" She tilted her head.

K: "Marine Raiders. Enter before the assault operation, cause significant damage to defenses with hit-and-run attacks, exhaust the garrison." I nodded. "Take 'em!"

I raised my Dager, and started tugging the trigger as fast as I could. It was not as smooth as a Glock's, it was more akin to the DA trigger pull of a Beretta 92. Not horrible, but it will tire your finger. Ten shots in five two-shot groups. I was going for damage, not kills, more to drop the Raptorians and let Sunset or Steela get them.

I paused, knelt, and reloaded, even though I still had one round in the chamber. Reholstering, I rose to see that the Raptorians had been dealt with. I jogged over and grabbed a discarded Sherman from one of them.

Running the bolt, I saw it was loaded. I popped the mag and glanced in it, seeing 8 rounds left. I put the (20-round) magazine back.

Sunset: "Looks like it's clear up in the village, too. Come on." She pointed with a wing.

We followed her. The village had a lot of holes in the walls of the buildings. Interestingly enough, the buildings were a diverse mixture of small Euro-styled houses, native huts of more primitive construction, and wood slab housing with tarpaper roofs.

Lt. Horloge: "We killed 12 enemy soldiers in the village. 6 Duregars, 6 Raptorians. I have one Marine wounded. They are taking her back on a litter, along with the colt." He shrugged. "The villagers.." He lowered his head, and nodded at the village's central building.

K: "I can guess. Executed, right?" I shrugged.

Lt. Horloge: "Ja." He frowned. "All dead. Right down to the smallest Foal."

K: "Laus?" I nodded to him. "What do you know about that fat porker, there?"

Laus: "Huh." He was cleaning his combat knife off - there were some feathers on him, indicating his recent activites. "That's a new one." He knelt down. "I didn't think they were deploying them to the front lines."

K: "He looks closer to Queen Porcina." I pointed, and wagged a finger. "There was a.. a creaure named Queen Porcina about ten thousand years ago. She was a living pig hominid. The Raptorians were a criminal gang of.." I gestured to one of the dead ones. "..they were smaller than that. More closer to my size."

Sunset: "And the Porcine?" She tilted her head.

K: "They're.. caricatures of her form. This looks like a living member of her legit species." I stood up. "Laus?"

Laus: "I see them every now and then. Usually in leadership roles. Company level or above. They almost never deploy in combat zones, though." He shrugged at me, palms out.

K: "Reason?" I asked. "This one seemed real eager to kill me."

Laus: "They're valuable because they have a brain. They're smarter than Raptorians. Maybe as smart as Goblins. Certainly more rational than Duregar. I don't know that much - I only ever reported to some of them for, like, passing messages and stuff. About all I ever got from them was acknowledgement. But, they did seem smart enough to know what they were doing." He shook his head.

K: "I'm betting they've got a society. Sexual reproduction, economy, culture, the whole bit. But, it's a small one - and Tirek probably keeps it that way so they don't end up with too many smart ideas about their position in the power structure. So, he deploys them sparingly, where brains AND loyalty are needed." I tapped my chin. "Compartmentalization done right. Tirek has really learned from his past mistakes."

Lt. Horloge: "What does dat mean, Kolonel?" He shrugged.

K: "Our enemy is smarter than we thought. That one Porcine commander that's supposedly running around in the hinterlands of Equestria and all that - he had a name. Porkarius. I think he's one of these." I pointed at the dead Porcine. "So, we have Porcina and Porcine. Porcine are a magical caricature of proper Porcina. A lesser species. Used as shock troops and heavy hitters in infantry actions. And these proper Porcina? Leaders that can blend in with them. And escape." I frowned. "It makes me wonder if any of them were part of the initial invasion forces.. that they learned from those battles. It would explain why Tirek's troops seem to get incrementally better.. slowly, as we tend to kill everything.. but still." I shook my head.

Lt. Horloge: "What do.. we do with.. ah.." He nodded to the main village building.

K: "There's not much we can do right now. We need a mass grave." I shrugged. "Just.. bury them all in place, I suppose. Get some engineers and some concrete and turn the building into one huge crypt. If anyone can bear the duty, go in there and lay them out one by one so they're not in disrespectful heaps." I sighed. "I need to report this to the Admiral."

Part 3: Forest on Fire

TIME: 14:22 NCT
DATE: War Day 907/2 Decemus, 1004 C.S. (Local)
LOCATION: 7km from Tanjungpinang, Bintan Island, Dutch East Indies

Into the jungle. Those five boats carried more enemy troops, we were sure of it.

Steela: "Is gut that you're not harmed, K." She was.. right next to me.

Sunset: "Heh. Seriously, though, Steela, thanks." She beamed a grin.. and wedged herself between us. "His wife'll be here in a few days and you can take the matter up with her." In a 'I see what you're doing there' way.

Steela: "Mmm." She just smiled a tiny bit.

K: "You're really.." I gestured to her.

Steela: "You underestimate how much I am.. fangirl.. of yours." She smiled and blushed. "It has been too long since Equus had a warrior like you. Oh, yes, you lead many brave ponies. But, you lead from the front. You never were a warrior in your home - you were rejected, yes?"

K: "Yeah." I smirked a bit.

Steela: "Yet, you come here.. and you.." She shook her head. "..dive in head first. No hesitation. No hiding. And if you had, I would not have disfavored you, I would have understood. No, you are willing to die for us. All of us. And you lead so well. And you.." She stopped and gently pawed a hoof under my chin. "..are handsome, for non-pony."

Sunset: "EASY, GIRL!" She laughed. "Keep that up, the enemy will find us by smell alone." She ribbed her.

Lightning Dust: "Ah? AH! AHAHHAHAH!" She covered her snout. "SUNSET! That's terrible!"

Sunset: "Well, it's true!" She smiled, though. "I get it. I've had him." She gave me a quick kiss on the cheek. "He's tough, yeah, but.." She shrugged. "..he's full of love, too." She nodded to me. "I can see why your human wife picked you."

K: "Yeah, J--.. she.." I blushed, thinking of her. "..she's a far stronger warrior than me."

Steela: "Then, K, I know that if you go back, a real Valkyrie will protect you." She nodded solemnly, calmed down now.

Lightning Dust: "..anyone smell that? Speaking of smells!"

Sunset: "Something's burning!" She sniffed the air.

K: "MARINES! FALL BACK TO THE EDGE OF THE JUNGLE!" I called out.

Lt. Horloge: "TERUGTREKKEN!" He started pulling his forces back.

K: "Sunset, get up and have a look." I pointed.

She did just that, catching some air and circling a little, before diving back down to avoid incoming fire.

Sunset: "They're lighting the jungle on fire!" She said, exasperated. "There's a wall of flame already - and it's headed this way!"

K: "Let's get out of here. Full retreat. GO! GO! GO! Laus! Call this in!" I called out, as the smoke started to get to us, and just start to haze over the air.

We moved back as fast as we could, though the fire advanced faster than we could withdraw. We had enough of a head start, though, to get back to the village before the flames hit us.

K: "EVERYONE OUT! FALL BACK TO THE CITY! THE WHOLE JUNGLE IS BURNING!" I ordered.

Lt. Horloge: "Trek je terug naar de stad! De jungle staat in brand!" He repeated in Dutch.

K: "Get your troops in front, Lieutenant." I pointed. "This is probably an ambush - we'll head down the beach instead of the road. Slow up to double time pace, but keep your weapons ready." I nodded. "We'll take point. Come on, everyone." I motioned for my team to follow me.

Laus: "This seems exactly like something they'd do, too." He frowned. "Might take out half the island with that fire."

Sunset: "Yeah. And I know I'm not powerful enough to stop it." She shook her head. "I might be able to redirect it some, but no, not stop a forest fire."

K: "Let's go." I nodded, taking point with the captured Sherman.

It struck me as odd that I'd feel so comfortable with it, considering how fast we moved from the Sherman to the aborted Patton, to the Bradley, then the Grant. And how many designs sprung from all of them, all over the world.

As we advanced along the beach, I could hear the fire starting to roar behind us. It was forming a fire storm. Having lived in California, where wild fires were just a fact of life, I knew all the signs. I knew we needed to get away.

Rather morbidly, the villagers would end up being cremated, if the fires got hot enough. The building their bodies were in was, of course, made of brick.

We moved in a very staggered formation, at double time, to get away from the fires. As I expected, this was a trap indeed. Up ahead was a very large cluster of Goblins.. forming a protective circle around one in the center.

K: "Wizard!" I pointed. "TAKE COVER!" I ordered. "Sunset, you and me." I nodded.

Sunset: "I'm.. SO not ready for this!" She snorted, but complied.

Me? Sword time. I was reminded that, no matter how comfortable guns made me feel, and how much Science will Fuck You, sometimes, a magical approach would work better and more efficiently.

The Wizard saw us, and to his credit, didn't try to intimidate us with speech. Instead, his cluster moved forwards as one, the other Goblins providing meat shields for him.

Sunset raised a magic shield around us, and I was reminded.. I could call on her power, now. She was an Alicorn. And.. heh-heh.. we had a connection alright. But, no. I started off with..

K: "SOMBRA! GIVE ME STRENGTH!" I called out.

Without realizing what was happening, the sword lifted me into the air. I was flying. Briefly, and at low altitude, but I was flying.

I aimed the sword at the Wizard, and willed myself to launch myself into him.

What I GOT was me firing myself towards the little beast along a vacuum wave, and impacting with him rather unexpectedly. Like, I buried the sword up to the hilt in his guts, and shocked the ground with darkness when I landed. That sent his entourage flying.

I couldn't get the sword out quickly, so, I let go of it, and pulled my Dager, and fired at the Goblins while backpedalling. I didn't realize it, but I'd travelled ~33 feet (10m) forwards. One of the Goblins tried to grab the sword, but (I'M GUESSSING) the residual energy from Sombra caused his soul to be instantly sucked out, and he shrivelled like a raisin before dropping dead.

Wow.

I got to a nice rock, and held there. Seeing the slide was locked back, I reloaded.

K: "COME ON!" I motioned to everyone.

What I didn't expect was a magic blast landing at my feet. Stronger than anything I'd felt before.

I landed another five meters away on my back, and felt stars all over my body. I lifted my head up, and I saw a hominidal opponent, perhaps five feet tall, advancing down the field of battle with several of the Goblin Mage Squads around him. He was making his way towards me.

Said hominid was dressed much like an old fashioned wizard. Robes and a cape. His skin was green, however, and his ears were sharply pointed. Grey hair, but no beard. He had a long, carved wand.. and he bore down on me with ill intent.

K: "HOLY SHIT!" I scooted up to my ass.. and realized my hands were empty.

I looked around and saw my Dager was about halfway between where I'd been, and where I was. Only one weapon left - my Bowie Knife. The Tall Wizard spotted my Dager in the sand and flicked his wand at it. It immediately sprang to life and ran away like a dog might.

K: "YOU!" I managed to get to my feet, looking quickly to my left and seeing my troops were fully engaged with the Goblins. "YOU'RE BEEZEN!"

Beezen: "VERY GOOD!" He laughed a raspy laugh.

K: "HOW!?" I tried to scoot back further.

Beezen: "Simple! Lord Tirek freed me from my eternal imprisonment at the hooves of Galactica Spark." He shrugged a bit. "You know my history. Shame I can't say the same!"

He fired a spell at me, but I rolled in the sand several times to avoid it, managing to get up into a crouch, and draw my knife.

K: "The name's K----! Human of Legend! Bringer of Science! And Science will FUCK YOU!" I pointed the knife at him - I wish it'd been a Funston.

Beezen: "FITTING!" He laughed. "Funny, you don't look like Meagan."

K: "We're not related." I shrugged a tiny bit, and launched myself at him unexpectedly.

He responded by bringing up a shield that I bounced off of, and flicked a spell at me, that sent me flying into the sand, another 4 meters distant from my sword. The Bowie Knife twirled in the air and landed flat in the sand.

I.. I needed the sword. DAMNIT, SWORD! I NEED YOU! Sword of Rainbow's Light, I NEED YOU!

It instantly pulled itself out of the Goblin Mage's corpse.. and flew right to my hand.

I looked halfway back to Beezen, and grinned.

Beezen: "..oh, my." He seemed very afraid, now.

Time to take this bitch downtown.

Part 4: Beach Battle Volleyball

TIME: 15:45 NCT
DATE: War Day 907/2 Decemus, 1004 C.S. (Local)
LOCATION: Beach Area near Tembeling Village, 6km from Tanjungpinang, Bintan Island, Dutch East Indies


Beezen: "YOU.. YOU EMPOWERED THE SWORD!?" He started backpedalling.

I launched myself from the ground, and advanced.

K: "Damn straight!" I yelled at him. "COME HERE! Let's see how much blood's in ya!" I roared, the momentum now shifting to my favor.

Beezen: "IMPOSSIBLE! The only way you could get that is.. is.. from one of the Old Gods!! THEY WOULD NEVER!" He yelled back.

K: "Seems they like me." I flicked the sword towards him, and by some shock, found that little shards of black energy came off the tip.

One hit his shield and cracked it.

Did "empowering the sword" mean.. somehow.. it could hold charge from the last called Alicorn longer and without draining all my willpower in the process? Did the SWORD ITSELF have a MANA POOL?!

I sneered at him, cruelly.. time to wrap this scumbag up like a bitch burrito.

Beezen: "ANIMA!!" He yelled, and fired the spell AT the sword itself.

As predicted, the sword reflected the spell back at him, but he smacked the spell charge with his wand, now flinging it back at me. Magic Volleyball. I flicked it back, and he took a mighty swing, deflecting it TOWARDS my troops. Ohh.. cheeky. I made a running dive into the sand, and smacked the ball with the sword, at an upwards angle, flinging it into the sky harmlessly.

K: "CHEEKY FUCK, AIN'CHA?!" I rose and prepared to charge.

Beezen: "DEANIMA!" He fired THAT one at my troops directly, but off to my left, intentionally.

I charged over and dove again, flicking the Sword of Rainbow's Light, and hitting it with just the tip (JUST THE TIP!). This caused the spell to deflect into the water. A whole school of DEAD fish rose to the surface immediately.

GOD, I wished Twilight was here, or Sunset wasn't under enfilading fire!

K: "Alright, BITCHMADE!" I pointed the sword at him. "CELESTIA, GIVE ME STRENGTH!"

This time, I intentionally willed the original "solar beam cannon" effect to the sword, and it complied, firing a massive beam at the little bitch, hitting his shield, sending him flying, and shattering the magic shield in the process. He landed on his ass, against a rock.

I charged at him.

Unknown Mare: "K! CATCH!" She yelled from the side.

I was hefted a Rasmussen Rifle. I caught it in one hand, braced it to my hip, slowed, and started shooting one-armed (left hand). I got off five rounds before it ran empty. Three of them hit the target.

Beezen was reeling. He rolled away from me, and cast magic on his wounds, only facing me when I got within ten feet (3 meters) of him.

Beezen: "You can't save them all!" He challenged. "DE-ANIMA STORM!" He pointed his wand at the sky.

This called forth a dark thunderstorm.. and the lightning was jet black. I saw it randomly hit a Porcine machine gunner and instantly shrivel him up. Okay, maybe he has a few tricks.

K: "Game called on account of rain." I pointed the sword at him. "Run. Your troops are going to be crushed and my troops know to target you next."

Beezen: "WE WILL MEET AGAIN!" He stood, hobbling back.

K: "Count on it." I nodded.

He vanished in a cloud of smoke.

Me? I looked up at the sky, and thought for a moment.. who could dispel magic like this?

K: "TWILIGHT! GIVE! ME! STRENGTH!" I pointed the sword at the sky.

A purple bolt shot out from the sword, impacted the Death Thundercloud, and caused it to turn a purple-pink before exploding with a mighty thunderclap, and dissepate instantly.

I looked around at the devastation. I had lost some Marines, I could see, but the enemy landing force had been eradicated while I was busy dealing with Beezen. We'd won.

I sat down on the rock next to me and started panting, reaching for my Canteen, and realizing it wasn't there - it had been shot off my belt.

The same mare from before trotted up and handed me a large waterskin.

Elsie: "Elsie Bon Voyage, Equestrian Free Press." She nodded, and whipped out a notepad and pencil. "Care to give me a statement in regards to the battle that just concluded?" And smirked.

I sat and drank from the waterskin.. eventually finishing it. And I stared at her while I tried to think of a good response.

K: "I'll give you a comment once I know how many friends we've lost." I nodded to her, stood, and went to find Lt. Horloge.

Sunset: "K! Over here!" She waved her hooves at me, and I dashed over.

K: "Sunset." I nodded.

Sunset: "It's kinda bad. Steela's hurt, but not badly. Lt. Horloge was killed, so was Sergeant Vanderbeak, and four others. Laus.." She nodded to him, as he was getting patched up by Maud. "..he took a bullet meant for Maud."

K: "Okay." I nodded. "Enemy casualties?"

Sunset: "Ninety-five percent. That wizard thing got away, but so did a few Goblins. I'm guessing at least a Regiment in size." She shrugged her wings.

I nodded, then turned to Elsie.

K: "We won a small victory at a great cost." I nodded. "The appearance of Beezen is cause for concern, but with the magic of friendship, the science of armaments, and the prowess of the Dutch soldier, we will prevail. Reinforcements are on the way, too, from allied nations." I shrugged a bit. "No further comment, no questions."

Elsie: "..okay, wow, that's the most bureaucratic neutral response I've ever heard." She blinked.. and grinned widely. "You've tangled with us before."

K: "Reporters? Yeah." I nodded a bit. "I know how you work." I pointed a finger at her. "I'll make you a deal. You want good copy, and you want an exclusive on the war, don't you?"

Elsie: "Yeah. Being sent to the East Indies was kinda a way of getting rid of me. I wanted to be in on this from the very start, but my Editor didn't want to cover the war much." She frowned, and shrugged. "What's your deal?"

K: "I'll make you famous." I pointed at her, and tapped her green jumpsuit. "You just became the official Equestrian Armed Forces Press Secretary." I smirked. "As Commander-in-Chief, I'm giving you an official rank of Warrant Officer." I smirked. "And giving you a job at the Stars and Sparkles."

Elsie: "Stars and Sparkles?" She blinked. "The Armed Forces Press Office?!"

K: "Want the job?" I grinned.

Elsie: "Sooooo.." She leaned in to me, flirtatiously. "..you're going to make sure I tell the facts you want me to tell, by making me a reporter for the military. AND making me famous by making me YOUR personal reporter?" A nod. "Alright. Alright." She extended her hoof. "I'll play."

I shook with her.

Sunset: "Mmm.." She shrugged a bit, and leaned in. "..don't try writing a story with deep under covers research into the dimensions of General Kay's personal resources." And batted her eyes. "Paddock's closed.. and I'll make you eat your pencil and notebook backwards if you try."

Steela came up behind her.

Steela: "If Steela doesn't get some? YOU don't get some." She leaned in gently, but with dominance.

Elsie: "..message received!" *Heh-heh* She blinked, and made a wide, uneasy grin.

Now I had a reporter on my side. And she'll need on-the-job training to be a combination of my personal Combat Camerapony, and War Reporter. More on how to do the Combat and War part than anything.

Now.. we needed to prepare for the invasion we all knew would come.

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Prelude

TIME: 07:50 NCT
DATE: War Day 910/5 Decemus, 1004 C.S. (Local)
LOCATION: Tanjungpinang, Riau Islands, Dutch East Indies


The last few days had been uneventful. No further activity. Patrols around the islands have turned up nothing. Beezen, when he fled, really fled. The village had burned to the ground, and the civilains inside had all perished. Mostly mares and foals - most of the stallions (technically bucks - they're mouse deer, remember?) had volunteered to fight.

This was just an extrapolation of the plan Laus warned us about. Terrorize and kill civilians, demoralize the troops. It was a solid strategy.

Two thirds of our troops were Colonial Infantry. That is, locals raised into local defense force units for exactly this situation. To defend these islands from Invasion. One regiment was saved from the island of Java, the other two regiments were from here, the Riau islands.

And then, we had our hastily trained, poorly armed, Citizen Militia - literally everyone that wanted to carry a gun. Almost all recruited from here, or the evacuees from the Arctic Light.

Several.. several families were affected by this massacre. Bitter tears were shed when hte news was announced. No one was happy about this. It made them more sad than it did angry.

That's why I was here. To leverage this crisis into anger, because that's usually how HUMANS respond to being attacked in such a manner. We get MAD, we want REVENGE, and we want to STOP the people that harmed OUR family, so they can't harm any others.

To this end, I'd been going around to the troops in their emplacements and giving speeches. Elsie was right there, too. She'd taken over as my comspony, with Laus injured. Rousing their anger, and reminding them, they'll have their chance VERY SOON.

Most responded positively. I hoped they'd have the discipline to hold fast, and obey orders, and not simply embark on personal vendettas once the shooting started.

Cohesion and discipline was the only real advantage we had.

Right now, I was in the ward room aboard the Utrecht, having breakfast.

VADM Duerpaard: "They should come today." He nodded. "How, do you think?"

K: "They'll try to hit all the beaches at once. We have to throw them off. Force them to focus their forces on one single point. If we can do that, we can gain the upper hand. They'll have a numerical superiority over us, but we can counterbalance that by making them hit us where we're strongest." I shrugged a bit.

Duerpaard: "And on the seas?" He looked up.

K: "They'll probably have Cruisers cover the landing and try to pin down the bulk of our fleet in harbor. Once breakfast is over, we need to put out to sea and make ourselves mobile. We're faster than them, we need to take full advantage of that." I tapped the table. "With your permission, I can direct the fleet action."

Duerpaard: "..I think perhaps you should. If we lose the seas, our ground forces stand no chance." He shrugged. "Those battleships can simply shell everything to pieces. What plan have you for them?"

K: "Basically? Hope they act dumb with them - we can pin them down and take them out by using massed torpedo attacks. The Utrecht is going to have to Meat Shield them somewhat - draw the battleships' fire, harass them with long range gunnery. If they draw a bead on a Light Cruiser with their main guns, the cruisers are going to take a beating." I gestured as I ate my toast.

Elsie: "The Neighponese Fleet radioed in - they'll be here in 10 hours." She nodded.

Duerpaard: "Mm." He stopped, and looked at his toast. "Please, Mister K. What are our chances? Honestly."

K: "They grow every minute. But.." I looked around the Ward Room a little. "..we're looking at probably 40-55% casualties or better, and I can guarantee we're probably going to lose a ship or two. IF.. if the Neighponese don't get here first. If they do, victory is ours for the taking. If not, every minute that passes, more friends will die."

Maud: "I believe we will be victorious. You are the single best commander on either side." She blinked exactly once, and rest her hoof on Boulder, her pet rock, who was 'seated' by her toast plate. "Boulder agrees."

Duerpaard: "Then.. while we may lose friends.."

He was cut off by a Dutch sailor running into the room.

Matroos der 1e klasse Matras Vulling: "ADMIRAAL! De verkenningseenheid meldt dat de vijandelijke vloot zich op 50 kilometer afstand bevindt en met een snelheid van 20 knopen nadert!" He looked at me, then Duerpaard, and pinned his ears back - he couldn't speak English.

Duerpaard: "The enemy is upon us." He nodded. "Vloot naar actiestations. Bereid je voor om de haven te verlaten." He directed, calmly. "About an hour and ten minutes to contact, Kolonel K." He shrugged.

K: "Action stations indeed." I rose, and wiped my mouth. "Come on, team." I looked at Elsie. "YOU stay RIGHT next to me, got it?!"

Elsie: "You got it! I need to be alive to report this!" She nodded, and rose fromh er seat as well.

Time to face the music. We all ran for the Bridge.

K: "Alright, everyone, settle down." I paced onto the bridge, adjusting my combat uniform to look as crisp and authoritative as I could. I had a set of two Eidelweiss stars on my collar, to add to the subdued rank patch on the tops of my shoulders, showing the Sun and Moon. "Remember your training. I know a lot of you, this is your first big and serious fight. We can do this." I nodded to each of them, and stepped up to the planning table, grabbing the sound powered phone. SPP> "CIC, Bridge."

CIC Comspony: SPP> "Go Bridge."

K: SPP> "Signal Kolonel Wolfheze. Red Alert. Invasion imminent. The fleet is moving to intercept the enemy. They've probably already sent more scouts to the shore. Signal Rotterdam - have Commandeur Roos form up in wedge formation, destroyers to the flanks, Frigates in the center. Prepare to screen the Cruisers. Then, signal each cruiser. Tromp and Zaen form one Division. Speyk and De Ryuter form the second. Ready torpedoes and move to either flank of Utrecht. The fleet is to depart immediately."

CIC Comspony: SPP> "Ja, Kolonel!"

K: "Admiral." I nodded to him, and put my hand on his shoulder. "We can do this. I know how much you care about them - I feel the same way."

Duerpaard: "The weight of command." He frowned a bit. "Mijn kameraden. Laten we dit een gevecht maken dat Tirek's troepen nooit zullen vergeten. We hebben één kans. Onze vrienden zijn onderweg, maar we moeten volhouden tot ze arriveren." He paced forwards a bit, and nodded. "Roerganger, bereid u voor om te vertrekken."

Elsie: "We.. we CAN do this..?" She looked up to me.

K: "We can." I nodded. "This will get messy, though."

Sunset: "We'll get through this, Kay." She smiled, and patted me with her wing.

Lightning Dust: "I know we can win." She steeled herself.

Maud: "I am also confident of victory." She held Boulder up in her hoof. "Boulder has choice words for Tirek." She slipped him back in a pouch on her hip. "Rest now, friend."

This was going to be one of the largest battles so far. A full Tirek invasion fleet versus a fairly weak Colonial fleet. Five Allied Regiments, versus two Brigades, which included two Battalions of his most elite troops.

As the fleet started to get underway from the harbor, I was filled with a terrible dread. I knew my friends were on the way, but I wasn't sure they'd get here in time to save us, or just perform a counter-invasion over some ruins.

Whatever the result, I had to do the best I could. For all of them.
