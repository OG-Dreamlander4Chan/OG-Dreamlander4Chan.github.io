Part 1: Effort

TIME: 17:32 ERST
DATE: War Day 179
LOCATION: Dream Castle Ruins

The sergeant led me around the corner to where everyone was. He was running ahead, fast, excited. I couldn't blame him. And I? I just strolled around the corner like it was nothing..

15th Company Sergeant: "HEY! HE'S ALRIGHT!" He yelled, coming around the corner.

Applejack: "WHAT'RE YOU GOIN' ON-"

And around the corner I came.

Of course, I should have expected to get tackled. With a zoom matching a 747 buzzing the deck, Applejack flew 20 meters to pounce me to the ground. I wound up flat on my ass, with Appleajack clinging to me for dear life. Pinkie had a leg.

Applejack: "AH! Yew big jerk!" She was crying. "Ah thought you'd died!"

K: "I'm fine." I pet her mane. "Really." And I pulled her sobbing lips up to mine for a kiss.

Rainbow Dash: *Vocie cracking* "Ahhhhh.. SEE!? I told you K was too tough for some little old magic to get him!"

Fluttershy: "You were the first one to start crying." She said, slyly.

Rarity: "You had us SO WORRIED!"

Twilight Sparkle: "Where did you go!? Where-"

Pinkie: "I KNEW YOU WERE FINE!" She started digging in my duffel bag. "Are these COOKIES?!"

K: "Oh, right, Sugarheart baked me a batch of cookies to give to you girls." I shrugged.

Nurse Redheart: "Sugarheart..?"

K: "Or, should I say.. YOU did.." I forced myself to sit up. "..have a look at the cookies, Redheart."

She did.. and a look of shock crossed her face.

K: "I went back into the past, ladies.. and I brought pictures." I looked at the Sergeant. "Start up a campfire, would you? This is going to take a while. And break out the vittles. We're going to be well past dinner by the time I'm done."

I pulled my duffel bag over and started going though it properly. I set the tins of gun powder aside - Colonel Williams had included several types, from powder good for precision work, to stuff good for assault rifles, and pistol powders. Hey, there's even a bag of primers in here.. corrosive ones, too (which is good, as they're more reliable for long term storage).


TIME: 22:44 ERST
DATE: War Day 179
LOCATION: Dream Castle Ruins, Front Courtyard

Everyone was enthralled with my stories of the dark past. I went over everything - and showed my cell phone pictures around. Twilight got Spike to start transcribing all of my schematics right away. Lyra got to see actual Sea Ponies.. well, a picture of them. And there was a photo of Megan, Danny and Molly in there.. just, all sorts of things. I'd hand-sketched the maps because I knew my battery wouldn't last indefinitely. It was a good battery - as long as I didn't make calls or play games on it, it would last powered-on for a good 10-12 hours. I pointed out the pictures I wanted Spike to transcribe. Rarity helped him out with a jeweler's loupe (that little thing they stick in their eye to inspect rings and such).

The cookies were delicious - and Redheart, once she ate them, actually sat and wrote out the recipe. She gave it to Pinkie for her to make, later. I sent a messenger off with the gun powder and primers - we'd been using copies of Eastern Bloc-formulated primers up to this point, but the military ones that Colonel Williams included were higher quality. I hoped that the chemists that worked at the arsenals, would be able to figure out the formula. It would improve our ballistics immensely. Finally, 300-meter shots that didn't look like rainbows, and 600-meter shots that weren't closer to mortar fire than rifle fire.

Twilight: "So, you actually met Galactica Spark?"

K: "Yep. And she's pretty much an asshole. The only thing that really mattered to her, was Celestia and Luna." I shrugged.

Pinkie: "DIDJA SEE ME!?" She bounced.

K: "Oh, I didn't see all of the ponies. Just a few of them. Most of them were at Paradise Estates for.. something, I forget now." I shrugged. "But I asked Megan if she'd leave us some clues to help find the Rainbow of Light."

Rainbow Dash: "Uh-huh.." She kicked back. "..did you see me there?! Was I still awesome!?"

K: "I deliberately avoided meeting certain ponies.. like Norfy and you. I.." I shrugged. "..what did you want me to do, Dash? Tell you two that you're going to start a conflict between Gods because of your love?"

Rainbow Dash: "I guess.. not.." She looked a little sad. "I understand." She still looked a little hurt.

K: "I'm sorry. My time had to be as limited as possible. Just by going back there, I completely messed up certain things, I'm sure.."

Luna: "I wouldn't say that." The voice was right off in the darkness. "I thought I'd find you here.." She paced out into the open and sat down next to Dash.. who had been sitting next to me the entire time, with Applejack on my other side, pressed as close to me as possible. "I've been listening for a while.. I wasn't sure if I should, but my sister and I decided to do this..."

She reached into her mane (how does she keep things in there?!), and pulled out the blanket. THE Blanket. The one they wrapped me up in, THOUSANDS of years ago.

K: "Luna..?" I looked at her, confused.

Luna: "I don't know what you'd call it, but.." She looked at the blanket. "..before you came here, we were both very connected to this blanket for reasons we didn't understand. When you were sent back into the past this afternoon, Twilight sent us a message that you'd vanished. Suddenly, my dear sister and I remembered why this blanket was so important. Our mother made it for us. It was the only truly happy memory we have of her." She put it in my lap.

K: "It's a time loop.." I started.

Mr. Smith (7th Doctor): "Oh, you're darn right it is." He walked up from the bridge area. "And no, I just got here."

K: "Okay, Smith. Explain for the class." I nodded to the other ponies.

Mr. Smith: "When you went back into the past, you created a time loop. But when you first arrived in Equestria, the time loop already existed." He started, pulling a chalkboard out of nowhere. "Going back into the past merely cemented it. Since the front half of the time loop - you at many thousands of years ago - had already occured, those who could have memories of your arrival, the Princesses, already had them. But unless you completed that circuit, the memories would remain phantom feelings. Like deja vu." He sketched this out with one hoof and a piece of chalk. "If you failed to complete the circuit, the memories would fade." He shrugged. "Simple as that."

K: "Then what am I doing here? Completing circuits? Seeing to it that fate occurs as planned?" I asked, a little annoyed.

Mr. Smith: "Not necessarily. Since the act of you going back into the past had not happened yet, it was a -potential- occurance, one that was by no means assured. You could have very easily been a few inches to the left, and merely felt the winds of the Elements of Harmony's magic pass over you, or to the right, and died from the overload. To put it in simple terms." He shrugged.

K: "How many other-"

Mr. Smith: "I can't tell you that." He held up a hoof. "The best I can do is explain what just occured."

K: "How am I normally supposed to get back to.. here?"

Mr. Smith: "You had the right idea, and had you pressed Galactica to send you back to the present day right on the spot, she would have."

K: "Then why did she-"

Mr. Smith: "Contact us? She didn't feel she had the power to do it properly, even though she did. She could have landed you within 48 hours of your departure."

K: "And you saved me.. why?"

Mr. Smith: "Because if we hadn't, you would have mucked up the past more than you did. I will say, though, you did a very good job preventing pollution in the time stream.. for an amateur."

K: *Sarcastically* "Gee, thanks."

Mr. Smith: "And your message to Colonel Williams was unneccessary. Neither he nor his children would have been anywhere near those locations you mentioned, anyway." He cocked a brow at me. "Do answer this, though. Why did you tell him?"

K: "Because.." I shrugged. "..he helped me. I didn't want to see him get hurt in any of those three events.. I could have gone on and told him of other things, but those were the three I was most afraid of."

Mr. Smith: "How fascinating that those three events stick out in your mind... do you see why we talk about you, now?"

K: "I suppose.." I shrugged again.

Mr. Smith: "You're a fascinating study of potential.. and since we're no longer what we used to be, you're something we can only observe." He wagged a hoof at me as though a finger was attached to it.

K: "Makes perfect sense. I'm an ant in an ant farm." I smirked. "An Alien Ant Farm." Okay, I liked ONE of thier songs.

Mr. Smith: "That was terrible." He frowned and put the chalkboard away. "Anyway, carry on."

K: "There's a very real possibility I'm going to die here, isn't there?"

Mr. Smith: "There's a very real possibility I'm going to have tea when I get home. I may just have a shot of hard cider and go to bed. I can't predict the future with certainty. No one can. Just.. keep calm and carry on." He gave me a grin and toddled off.

K: "Well, that was fascinating." I shrugged. "Alright, bed time. I'm exhausted, and my body isn't sure what time 'now' is, any more."

Twilight: "Great idea."

I lolled over and made myself comfortable.. only to have Luna cover me with the blanket.

Luna: "We still trust you, K." She said, protectively curling up next to me, with Applejack in front of me.

Applejack: "Yeah, don' go scarin' a girl like that again, huh?" She kissed me and nuzzled into my chest.



TIME: 09:00 ERST
DATE: War Day 180

I woke up to breakfast cooking. A very VERY pregnant Derpy was there with her Stallion - Dr. Whooves to the rescue again - this time with a supply wagon from the Ponyville Militia, and the Flower Girls cooking for us. Off in the distance, Celestia was talking with Twilight. A very sleepy Luna was next to her. Applejack was still buried in my chest, though she was fully awake. And why was my back still warm?

Rainbow Dash: "You finally awake?" She flopped over my side.

K: "Yeah." *YAWWWWWNN* "Do I smell coffee and bacon?"

Golden Harvest: "Call it a present." She brought over some fresh eggs to the Flower Girls.

K: "A present?"

Derpy: "Special delivery, sleepy head!" She put an edition of the Canterlot Times in front of me.

Headline? 'GENERAL K NEARLY KILLED IN SKIRMISH WITH UNDEAD' Oh, right, I nearly died. Again.

As everyone got the breakfast ordeal cooked and eaten - Princess Celestia actually ate with us - we went over our next step.

K: "As I understand it, once the lead monster died, all the zombies dropped dead." I shrugged.

Twilight: "Yes, exactly." She nodded to me.

K: "Alright, then. That means we can explore the ruins in peace." I gestured.

Dr. Allcome: "I'm quite eager to see if there's anything left from the ancient ponies. Other than the photographs you brought back." He blinked.

K: "Yeah, I should have asked Colonel Williams for a Polaroid camera and some film. But, hey, what'ch'a'gonn'ado, eh?" I shrugged.

Celestia: "Colonel Williams was a big help.." She nodded, sagely.

K: "Militarily, yes. His contribution to our war effort cannot be under stated. With him, we now have access to the formula for high-velocity rifle powder, and proper modern training manuals. I'll have to read through them later on and see what applies to ponies.. see where our training can be improved. Sadly, he couldn't exactly leave us with an Abrams Tank." I made hand motions indicating a huge fighting vehicle.

Celestia: *Giggle* "Well! Perhaps you'll have to develop one!"

K: "Don't tempt me. But I think we'll do alright with what we've got so far." I shrugged.

Sunshine: "So, back into the ruins again?" He nodded to them.

K: "Yeah, though, this time, our investigation should proceed more smoothly. Fewer interruptions." I nodded as I downed the last of the coffee in my canteen cup. "Plus, Spike transcribed some documents I got ahold of, and I have a sketch here of ancient Ponyland." I said, pulling it out.

Celestia: "Hm.. so Paradise Estates is a real place." She said, looking over my shoulder. I was flanked by Princess-ness - Luna was lightly dozing off to my left, Celestia to my right.

K: "Yeah. I didn't go there myself, I didn't want to pollute the time stream more than I already was." I gestured a bit.

Dr. Whooves: "See, I kept telling you, honey, General K really is smart about these things." He nodded, with a grin.

Derpy: "Oh, I didn't doubt him, I was just saying, the probability of additional unsynchronized time lines resulting from his interaction with our world is quite high - and whether he interacts with each specific altered point of the time stream is very much up to him." She nodded to her Stallion, with a smile.

Rainbow Dash: "Uh.. what?" She blinked in confuse.

Derpy: "K might have additional Timey-Wimey things he hasn't done, that he has done, yet." She slightly narrowed her eyes, and smiled.

Rainbow Dash: "R-Right." She blinked, still not quite getting it.

Celestia: *Giggle* "I never understood why you wanted to be a Mail Pony, my dear. You could be teaching at the University." She said in a motherly tone.

Derpy: "Well-l.. mail's important to friendships, isn't it? Without the royal mail, friends long distances apart would have a very hard time keeping in touch with each other. Someone's got to do it." She sipped her tea. "Plus, the univeristy's full of muffin-heads." She gave a little nod at this.

K: "You never cease to amaze me, Derpy." I smiled. She really was a special friend.

Celestia: "Well! My dear sister needs to be put to bed, and I feel I'd probably get in the way, so, we shall take our leave." Celestia stood. "Take care of yourselves, My Little Ponies."

Celestia - and her guards, helping Luna into her carriage - left. The other girls from Ponyville, though, stayed behind. Derpy made herself useful by helping me sort through the training manuals Colonel Williams left us.

Dr. Whooves: "Oh, K! Before I forget.." He handed me a large leather pouch with a belt loop. "Derpy made this for you."

K: "Oh.. handy." I made about attaching it to my belt, and put most of the small tools that Colonel Williams gave me, inside it. "Good, I can carry my tools around, now. THANKS, DERPY!"

Derpy: "No problem! I have to keep busy somehow!" She smiled.

Dr. Whooves: "The girls are planning a baby shower next week. I think Derpy would appreciate it if you attended." He nodded to me.

K: "Count me in. I'll even bring a present." I gave him a half-hug before accepting my Patton back from Ambrosia.

Ambrosia: "Same partners as last time, General?" She asked, checking her Chaffee.

K: "Yep. But let Spike sleep - he was up all night straining his eyes, trying to copy all kinds of information out." I put my magazine bandolier on. Ambrosia even refilled it for me.

Ambrosia: "Alright." She nodded and moved off with Twilight.

Dr. Allcome: "Oh! K." He came up with Sunshine. "Tell me, what was this castle like, in the past?"

K: "Well.." I paced to the front door. "Right here, was the main entrance. There was a hall here, but it's gone now. Then right over here.. where this empty space is, that was the tea room. The kitchen is still mostly intact, it's right over there, but the walls are different." I pointed. "This cliff face used to extend out over that way a long ways, and there was a stream right over there, where the crevasse is now. Of course, at the bottom of the crevasse is a stream, so it might be the same one." I pointed.

Dr. Allcome: "Fascinating!"

K: "Yeah, the SeaPonies loved the stream." I nodded at the crevasse. "They were always playing in it. The cut-off right here for the edge of the cliff is right about where the pond was. Then over there, deeper into the woods, there used to be a waterfall. It's where the Rainbow Bridge ended." I scratched my chin.

Dr. Allcome: "And this Rainbow Bridge leads back to your world?"

K: "You know what? I'm not sure any more. It might lead back to Megan's world. And if that's the case, from my perspective, it leads to an alternate Earth. An Earth where I might not exist. I just don't know, for sure." I shrugged.

Dr. Allcome: "An alternate Earth.. it's as amazing to think about as an alternate Equestria." He smiled, amazed.

K: "If it really is an Alternate Earth and not merely a reflection of Equestria - that is, it comes with the package of Equestria, dimensionally speaking - then it proves a theory that scientists on my Earth have been debating for ages. Then again, if Megan's Earth only exists because of Equestria, then who knows? Their Earth may be thousands of years in the future as well. I might not even recognise it. Still, for me, it's a second Earth." I mused.

Dr. Allcome: "That's a fascinating theory. Whether that Earth only exists because of us." *Hmm!* "Thank you, K." He toddled off, thinking to himself.

Me? I went and found my spelunking partner.

K: "Hey, Applejack, you ready to go?" I asked, as I got the last of my stuff in my pockets.

Applejack: "Ready when you are, honeybun." She sidled up to me and nuzzled.

Now that we didn't have to worry about an opposing force in the ruins, I wondered what strange clues we might find? Did Megan remember to leave them? And what else might've been left behind?

I suppose we'd have to find out.

{End of Part 1}

Part 2: Echo

TIME: 13:00 ERST
DATE: War Day 180
LOCATION: Dream Castle Ruins, Basement

We were back down in the basement again, looking over the things we had been piling up when the Zombies attacked us. The cloth that Applejack had found was being dragged out to the main entrance area. Rarity seemed thrilled with it - apparently, the cloth was some kind of rare material that didn't exist any longer. This time - just in case - we had some 15th Company troops helping us haul everything out of the castle that looked important. We'd go over it all later.

Applejack: "Ah got no clue what we're gonna find down here." She stated, a little frustrated as she went through the closet the Zombie Raptorian came out of.

K: "No idea. Anything is something, though. And if we don't find anything here, we know where Paradise Estates is, we can check there." I said, pulling some crates open.

Nothing inside but some long-corroded crayons and other toys for baby ponies. I set the toys in a collection box. The sergeant from earlier, who heralded my return to the living was carrying them out.

15th Co. Sergeant: "Hey, these toys look pretty special.. hand made. My kids would love these. Oh, there's a human name on this one.." He held it up.

K: "Let me see it." I held my hand out, and had a toy rocking horse dropped in my palm.

The toy rocking horse was perhaps five inches (127mm) high, painted, and through the faded paint, I could see the accurate markings of U.S. Cavalry from the late 19th century... with a lieutenant colonel's rank insigna on the horse blanket. On the bottom? 'D-A-N-N-Y'

K: "Hm.. set this in the 'potential clues' bin. We'll examine it later. And.. I suppose you and the others can have at the toys when we're done with them. No sense them going to waste." I shrugged.

15th Co. Sergeant: "Oh, thank you, General!" He put Danny's horse in the 'Clues' bin and carried out my latest filled bin of 'Most Likely Not Clues' (hey, Pinkie named the boxes).

Applejack: "We're just about done in hea'h.." She huffed. "..b'sides the horse, you find anythin'?"

K: "No. Not really. There's a very good chance we may not find anything here, but we need to check anyway." I said, wiping the sweat from my brow with a handkerchief. "Let's see what's down deeper."

I nodded to a stairwell, pulling out a piece of chalk. I wrote 'Went Down Stairs' right on the wall. Pinkie's Perfect Pastel Pink made great message chalk. It was almost scary how well Ponies blended with warfare.

Applejack: "Alright. Come on." She dusted off her hands and grabbed her Sagebrush, making sure it was loaded.

Down we went, to the sub-basement. This wasn't from the old playset.. A classmate of mine in elementary school, J{REDACTED} N{REDACTED} had a lot of Pony toys. Then again, the old playset didn't even have a FIRST basement. The stairs got darker as we went further and further down. No light down here..

Applejack: *Shakey* "Uh-hh-hh.. y-y'a sure it's safe down here?" She clung closer to me.

K: *Sigh* "Do you not like the dark, honey?"

Applejack: *Shakey* "N-Nonsense!" *Snort* "I'm fine! Jes' fine!" *Gulp*

K: "Give me a minute, I'll get a torch out." I stopped on the stairs, and dug in my backpack for one of our torches.

Finding it, I hit it with a flint and steel and let it catch alight. That sent a flood of bats out at us.

Applejack: *AAAAHHH!* She dove between my legs.

K: "It's just bats, honey." I shrugged.

I wasn't really afriad of them. In elementary school, I got to pet one. Granted, he was asleep at the time. Very docile thing. Brushie-Brushie? Nah, Colgate's not here.

K: "Come on. These stairs go really deep." Down. Farther.

We hit the bottom of the stairs unexpectedly. We hit rock, is what we did..

Applejack: "Hey, bring that torch ova' here?"

I leaned the torch over to where she was pointing. Sure enough, the stairs looked like they continued deeper into the ground, but there was rock, dirt and more covering them. We were in some kind of a cave, under the castle.

K: "Stay on your guard." I cautioned as we advanced into the cave.

Applejack: "Whut ya' s'pose is down here?" She asked, almost cowering.

K: "Are you afraid of caves, or something, honey?" I cocked a brow to her.

Applejack: "Naw! S'Just.. we been encounterin' so much weird stuff lately.. it's like antic'pation.. like I'm 'spectin' somethin' ta happen.. s'got me on edge. Rather it jes' jump out 'n git us, so's we c'n buck its teeth in." She rubbed the back of her neck with her right fetlock.

K: "I understand." I shrugged. "Just try to relax, hm? Could be worse." I cheerfully pointed out.

Applejack: "How could it be worse!?" She retorted.

K: "We could be in a cave full of zombies that are immune to bullets." Return of the Living Dead.

Applejack: "Well, that ain't comfortin'!" She huffed.

K: "Wasn't supposed to be." I said, casually, looking at some cave art. Some kind of drawing.. "Hey, hon, look at this, huh?"

Applejack: "Yah.. hey, I rec'a'nize this! It looks like.. somethin' outta the foundin' of Equestria." She scratched her chin. "..didn't the whole thing with Celestia kinda tell us that was all bunk, though?"

K: "Not necessarily. Celestia didn't assume direct control right away, remember? The entire history of Equestria's founding may not be all bunk." I studied the images a little longer, before handing Applejack the torch. "I'm going to try to sketch them. My wife was better at this than I was.." I said, pulling out my pad of paper and a pencil.

Applejack: "Y'still miss her, don'cha..?" She asked, with a bit of a quiver in her voice.

K: "Yeah..." *Sigh* "...not that you haven't made me happy. You have. I'm grateful for every second I spend with you..." I started, as I sketched the cave drawing. "...I love you, Applejack. I'm never going to stop missing my wife, though. But I've kinda accepted that I'll never see her again, so, I'm focusing on making life here as happy as possible." I continued, still trying to replicate what I saw, as close as possible. "And a major part of that, is you." I smiled at her.

Applejack: "Awhh.. y'er such a sweetheart.." She nuzzled my side gently. "..ah suppose ah should'a 'spected an answer like that." She was blushing. "Really, ah di'int think ah'd meet a stallion'd make me happy lahk you do." She looked up at me, and I caught a look of admiration in her eyes. "Let 'lone one walkin' on two legs." *Giggle*

K: "Yeah, well, some of us just get lucky, in matters of the heart. I got lucky twice here, and once back on Earth." J really was the luckiest thing to ever happen to me, back there. And Applejack was the same here - as was Luna, in her own way.

Applejack: "Where 'ya suppose this cave came from?" She asked, changing the subject tactfully.

K: "No clue. It might've come along after the destruction of the first pony civilization - before Celestia forced integration. We really should ask her about that.. how history is different from what we're being told. What caused the first civilization to fall, and why." I said, finishing up the sketch as best I could.

Applejack: "Well, it goes deeper. We ought to check it out." She said, despite her fears.

K: "Alright." I put the sketch away, and took the torch back from her. "Let's go."

Applejack: "Raight." She picked up her Sagebrush and left it casually slung over one shoulder.

Deeper into the cave we went.. most of it typical boring cave stuff that an animated show would skip-frame or melt-frame through to imply a long journey - which it certainly was - and allow the viewer to cut right to the interesting parts. We didn't talk that much during the trip - but we did stop to look at a few nice rocks along the way. One of them looked vaguely like an apple with a bite taken out of it. If I had any way of recharging my phone, I would have taken pictures, but we stopped to admire it for a bit.

After about twenty minutes of a liesurely pace, we came to a hallway made of cut stone. Similar in cut and shape to the Castle itself, this hallway wasn't made of the same material (this looked more like sandstone, rather than granite), but the same construction none the less.

Applejack: "Well, this is interestin'.." She said with a hint of shock.

K: "Yeah, by my calculations, we should be running almost parallel to the crevasse.. considering the angle the cave was at, and the turns we made.." I found a Torch Holder and placed the lit torch in it, pulling out another one from my backpack and lighting it on the already-lit one. "Let's have a look around. This reminds me of some kind of disaster bunker of some kind."

Applejack: "Disaster Bunker..?" She cocked a brow.

K: "In my world, we made weapons capable of levelling entire cities. They were only used twice in anger, to end a horrible war as quickly as possible. But the fear that they might be used again - or that some other disaster of some kind might erupt - caused some people to build shelters and bunkers in their yards, to protect themselves and their families from them. This looks like it was made for the same reason - to protect against some kind of a disaster." I shrugged. How do you explain Atomic Bombs to someone with no concept of atomic science?

Applejack: "That's terrible..! No wonder you like it here.." She trailed off.

K: "I'd rather weapons only ever be needed as a deterrent, to impress on others the futility of violence and stop such things before they start, but it seems that even here, there's always someone that wants to hurt someone else. That's why we need weapons in the first place. Violence is everywhere, and all you really need are your bare hooves to do someone harm." I shrugged. "I just happen to be well educated on the subject."

Like in Self-Defense situations - often, pulling out a firearm and brandishing it at a legitimate threat is enough to keep the situation from escalating and force the threatening person to back down, thus preventing violence. This theory was just Self-Defense on a larger scale - and it worked, in a strange way. The two nations with the biggest guns (the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.) never actually fought a war with each other, for fear of the weapons the other had. That's rather over-simplifying the situation, but...

Applejack: "Well, AH'M greatful MAH Stallion's so smart on these here things." She one-leg hugged me as we walked up the hall.

...ah, hell, I can't think Cold War politics with her around. It always turns to romantic thoughts.

The hallway led in about fifty feet, before we came to a series of doorways. These were constructed more crudely, like the work hadn't been finished. I felt along the edges, and I could still feel chisel gouges. No attempt made to smooth them out.. and that was troubling.

K: "Let's check these rooms." I said, pulling out a third torch, and lighting it off the one I had. "Stay alert." And I handed it to her.

Applejack: "Alrighty."

We started checking each room. And in each, we found the same things. Some plates, some vases, other "table ware" for ponies. Evidence of them staying here for some time, and that they were prepared for this. Some of the table ware had more wear and tear on it than others. A few were chipped or cracked, but looked like they continued to be used anyway.

This WAS a Disaster Bunker.. whomever built it, didn't have time to properly finish it, but it was most definately USED. It struck me that I was in the same position as an archaeologist from some fantastic future time, exploring a 1950's atomic bomb shelter, and not having any idea that the threat of nuclear war had caused its construction, and that war itself, brought about its use.

I had no idea why ponies built this, what the threat was, or why they'd ended up using it. It wasn't nice or pretty, like the castle had been at one time. It was rough and ugly, utilitarian.. yet, it had been used. But, why?

Part 3: Blood of the Innocent

TIME: 15:33 ERST
DATE: War Day 180
LOCATION: Beneath Dream Castle, Abandoned Bunker

We moved thorugh the rest of the side rooms, finding more of the same - evidence that the place had been inhabited, but not by whom, or why. Eventually, we moved out of this hallway - that seemed to be the living quarters, and followed the hallway up and across a small platform that looked out into an amazing sight - an underground farm, perfectly illuminated.

K: "Oh.. Holy Celestia!"

Applejack: "Ahh...!!" Her eyes were as wide as dinner plates.

K: "There must be.. enough crops here to feed.. hundreds of ponies. Easily." I blinked.

We were standing on an overlooking platform that was about three stories above what had once been a large open area. It had been converted into a very complex, well-crafted farm. Hyper efficient, even, by Pony standards. And that being the case, the farm looked splendid. There were crops I didn't recognise at first, but some of the essentials were there - some type of wheat, some form of stunted tree that grew its leaves and branches out more like a large bush.. of course, it was all heavily overgrown and crops were spilling out everywhere, but the farm looked like it had been deliberately set up to run without maintenance, save crop tending, and even then, all we really had was overgrown crop land.

Applejack: "Are those Apples on that tree!?" She squinted at part of the 'orchard' - which looked like it was growing almost sideways out of the rock.

K: "Where's the light coming from?" I was looking around for it, the light source, but I couldn't tell. "Forget it. Applejack, go get.. Doc Allcome, Sunshine, Ambrosia, Twilight, and some ponies from Fifteenth Company." I just.. sat down. "I'm staying right here. Go on."

Applejack: "Alrighty." Off she ran.

I stared at the farm. Was it boobytrapped? Not likely. But everything here seemed like it had been deliberately designed that every square centimeter of space could grow something edible. And it had spread beyond the boundaries of the original farm land. I could hear moving water.. but I couldn't see it. Was it underneath the soil, and saturating it from below? Some kind of irrigation system? So many questions! But this.. technology? Whatever it was, this would solve any hunger issues the world might have. I wasn't actually sure if they had any, but I was starting to question a lot of things now.

Ever since that fight with the Zombies, I was really starting to wonder what the hell was going on with this world. It looked so happy on the surface, but it was a gilded age. Underneath the glitz and joy, was racism, hatred, fear, and violence. Sure, not on the scale humans were capable of - Tirek not withstanding - but it was there. This wasn't the My Little Pony I had watched. But was this the truth?

I looked around as I re-tied my boot laces. There was faint graffiti on the wall.. a familiar tone to the words. "Nothing is true. What is permitted? Question everything." It reminded me of the Assassin's Creed games, but the quote was off. Nothing is true? Was that a warning? I stared at the farm as I pulled out Colonel William's M-19, and fondled it. Hefty gun. I wasn't used to the weight, yet. I popped the cylinder and pulled a round out.. and I sniffed it. 158 grains of good ol' American Freedom in every bullet. I smirked a little.. America. WE could benefit from crop-growing technology like this.. end world hunger. A pipe dream, given that overabundance of food will eventually cause a population collapse, but, this kind of crop growing technology.. if we had a space program.. and we could colonize other worlds.. humanity expanding..

..a wonderful pipe dream. I let myself revel in the thought. I was going to memorize whatever unique techniques were at work here. If I brought this back to my world, and somehow managed to help others with it, every last shred of suffering I was going through here, would be worth it.

Why is it that my thoughts always go to "How can I help someone else?" I didn't know. I was always like that. Maybe that's why a part of me enjoyed this place so much. Because, despite its problems, that's what they all wanted to do. The girls, that is. Help others.


TIME: 16:02 ERST

Estimating Applejack's travel time there and back, she should be returning soon. I was still sitting down, eating some Turkey Jerky from my backpack. That's when I spotted movement.. over near the orchard. Setting my pack quietly aside, I swallowed the rough jerky still in my mouth in one gulp. Then, I realised, I'd left my Patton back in the upper basement.. so, M-19, time to show your stuff. I pulled it from its holster, and gently crept over to the left of the platform, where a gentle incline led down to the farm.

What was it, that I saw? A straggler Zombie that wasn't linked to Slepnir? Grogar, perhaps? Bray? Rep? The last survivor of Old Ponyland? Hostile or friendly, that was the eternal question. I moved down the incline slowly, carefully, and crept to the corner of a bush-tree. Gently pushing my face through the shrubbery, I tried to get a good look at whatever this was..

...and boy, did I get a shock.

K: "KING HUGO!?"

A very old, very withered Grundle turned towards me, squinting. No, it wasn't King Hugo.. different face..

Grundle: "Hugo the Great, I am not. But last of the Grundles, is what you see." A withery old voice, for a withery old man.

K: "I'm sorry, sir." I stepped out of the bush, and put the M-19 away. "You're the last of the Grundles? What happened!?" That would CERTAINLY explain why there weren't any around..

Applejack: *Distant* "Honeybun!?"

K: "Down here, honey!" I called, not looking away.

Grundle: "What happened to our great Kingdom, tragedy it was! We were utterly destroyed by-"

Applejack arrived with the others. Sunshine Smile gasped in horror when he saw who I was standing with.

Grundle: "PONIES!"

Sunshine: "GRUNDLE!"

K: "Wait-what?"

Sunshine: "YOU DIE THIS DAY, FOUL BEAST!" He raised his Patton and took aim-

-Only for me to move between him and the Grundle, arms out.

K: "SERGEANT, DROP YOUR FUCKING WEAPON, NOW!"

Sunshine narrowed his eyes.. like he was debating whether shooting THROUGH me would manage to strike and kill the Grundle I was protecting.

Applejack stuck her Sagebrush in his face.

Applejack: "Trah it, Pardner. Ah'll buckin' END you!"

Sunshine: "..you have no-"

K: "LAST. CHANCE."

Applejack narrowed her eyes at him.. Twilight pulled her own weapon on Sunshine as well.

Twilight: "Don't make us shoot you, Sunshine."

Sunshine: "FINE!" He let the Patton go on its sling, holding it out and away from his body.

Applejack retrieved it from him, while Twilight took his Lee.

K: "I want answers."

Sunshine: "Are you sure you want to ask the questions, General?"

What the hell was going on here? Ponies and Grundles were FRIENDS! The Ponies HELPED the Grundles! They protected them from Hydia's Smooze in ancient times! Why had Ponies apparently wiped out all the Grundles, to the last? I asked all of these questions.. rapid-fire. Sunshine wasn't too pleased about all of this.. more the fact that I had protected what he saw as a threat, than I was asking all these questions.

Sunshine: "Standing orders from Princess Celestia. Why ELSE would we terminate such dangerous monsters?"

Grundle: "Danger? Us? You are far more of threat to peace than we, o' four-legged ones." He didn't seem angry about it..

Sunshine: "It's not explained in schools-"

Twilight: "No kidding."

Sunshine: "But.. thousands of years ago, or so the story goes, Grundles took advantage of the schism between the Pony Clans and claimed territory that was in dispute. Fertile land. Where food was grown.. food we all needed. And threatened to cut off the supply. So, we fought them. They used terrible weapons against us, and they were unified, whereas we couldn't even agree on a battle plan. They nearly won, but the Unicorn Tribe was able to craft a dark spell to exterminate many of their number. So the story goes, when Celestia became the ruler of Equestria, she kept the policy in place that Grundles should never be allowed in Equestria again. Tresspass is death." *Snort*

K: "You've been following an archaic policy.. and an archaic tale. And never questioned it?" I whipped my hands out wide in frustrated confusion.

Sunshine: "Why would I?" He seemed.. shocked.. that I would consider questioning something like that.

K: "Grundle.. uh.. what's your name? What's your side of the story?"

Grundle: "No name, have I. Just Grundle. Mother and father never told me name. So, just Grundle. Name of me is name of my long-lost people. Truth? Want the truth? Truth, you cannot handle! But truth you shall get. We did claim land that ponies claimed. But the land was not fertile at all. Land was barren. We made land fertile again.. worked hard. Then, Ponies hunger for more and more food. War ravage crops of theirs, they haven't enough. So, they ask us. We give. Others ask - we not see ponies as anything but one - and we give again. When third ones ask, we have nothing to give, and we say other ponies asked before. So, they took by force. Then the other two. By force again. We defend ourselves. But, we were few and they were many. Then, dark magic comes, and.." *Finger snap* "Most of us gone. Wise pony, Gallart Bonebeard, he take us to Ancient Pony Place and tell us stay hidden. We hide.. and he not come back. That all I know."

K: "The only thing you two seem to agree on is the food shortage and the dark magic." *Hmpf* I crossed my arms, frustrated.

Twilight: "I had no idea about any of this. I don't even know who Gallart Bonebeard is!" She shook her head in disbelief.

Dr. Allcome: "I've no idea, either. I've never seen any reference to Grundles in any of our history." He shook his head.

K: "This is unbelieveable! What's next, I find out all the Bushwoolies were turned into coats?" I flapped my arms in exasperation.

Sunshine: *Callously* "Hats, actually, but they weren't intellectually evolved creatures anyway. Nothing of value was lost." His face was even.

K: "WHAT?!" I looked shocked and enraged at the same time.

Sunshine: "GOTCHA!" *Laughter* "Oh, the look on your FACE!" He pointed a hoof at me.

I wanted to blow his face off with my wife's shotgun.

Sunshine: "No.. no.. I WAS KIDDING!" He waved his forelegs at me, defensively. "No, really, I've never heard of them, I just kinda went with it." He shrugged.

K: "Bad joke, Sunshine. Really. Bushwoolies were adoreable little things. How would you like it if I took you to a Glue Facotry from the 19th century?" I crossed my arms. "They used to make glue from horse hooves.. they'd just cut the hooves off, and leave the horse to die. Of course, most of them were half dead already, so, it didn't matter - they were just stupid, used-up beasts anyway." *Snort*

Sunshine: "What, I can't do a little black comedy?" He shrugged, kinda miffed.

K: "..you know, I've never really heard Black Comedy from a Pony before.." That realization just came to my mind.

Sunshine: "Well.."

K: "No, no, keep it up. It's.. refreshing." I patted him on the shoulder. "But don't quit your day job."

Applejack: "So, Grundles were.. whut.. victims'a circumstance?"

K: "Sounds like it. And the stories were twisted to make the attacks sound more justified.. possibly some Boogeyman Syndrome in there, too." I crossed my arms again, and nodded.

Dr. Allcome: "Boogeyman Syndrome?" He tilted his head at me.

K: "Go to sleep, kids, or the Boogeyman will get you? Something used to scare people, basically." I up-nodded to him.

Dr. Allcome: "Ah, I see." He nodded a couple times, understanding.

Grundle: "So, you no killings, then?" He asked, but I had a feeling he didn't really care.

K: "Of course not. So, you've been living here, all alone, all this time?" I asked, taking a seat on a rock.

Grundle: "Yes. Never outside. Outside is ponies, and ponies are danger." He nodded, as if he were reciting something.

K: "What a sad thing.." I frowned. "..Twilight, bring me Pinkie and all of her best material!" I stood up, fist on my hip. "We are going to FIND a reason to party!"

Grundle: "What is party?"

Twilight: *Giggle* "Ask Pinkie that, when she gets here." And off she ran.

Sunshine: "So, uh.. what do we do?" He asked, shrugging, sitting his flank down.

K: "What do you mean, Sunshine?" I shrugged. "We're going to have a Pinkie Pie party and love it, is what."

Sunshine: "I mean after that, General. You kinda get the idea that.. well, he's not exactly going to be welcome in Equestria. Some Royal Guards may just shoot first and ask questions later. Or not at all."

K: "Point. But, I'll think of something." I patted him on the back. "YOU see he's not a danger, right?"

Sunshine: "Well, I suppose not. I trust you, though, General. If you say he's not a threat, then he isn't, as far as I'm concerned. I'm just worried about what the Princesses will think." He said, raising a hoof thoughtfully.

K: "Yeah, okay. I understand that. I'll talk to them. Hopefully, they trust me as much as you do." I started looking around the overgrown garden. "Is all this food edible?"

Grundle: "All edible! All tasty. But so much work. Body old and tired, can't work much. But food grows anyway, so no worries." He sat down on a large mushroom the size of a foot stool. "Please. You first people I see in ever. Have food! Tasty food."

Applejack: "Ah wanna try one'a these here apples.." Without a thought, she grabbed one off the nearest tree-bush and bit into it. Munching it for a moment, I could hear the Grundle chuckle.

Grundle: "Them not apples..!" He warned.

Flames shot from Applejack's mouth and she jumped five meters into the air.

Applejack: *WAAUUGHH!* "HOT-HOT-HOT-HOT!" *Firesnort*

Without looking at the display, I pulled my canteen out and held it out for her. I could feel her grab it and guzzle the whole thing down.

Applejack: *HOOOOooooooooooooo-EEEEEEEE!* "Whut's IN them things!?" *Lip smacking*

Grundle: "Is Fire Berry! Tasty with Bean Soup!"

K: "Chili.. you invented chili." I smirked.

Dr. Allcome: "Are you alright, Miss Applejack?" He moved to her.

Applejack: "Ah'm fine. Hotter'n I 'spected, but hoo! That's some tasty fire berry!" She beamed a grin, her cheeks flushed red.

Grundle: "Green is sweet, red is hot, rainbow is special-"

Applejack: *Flat/Serious* "DijujustsayRainbow?"

Grundle: "Yes! Rainbow Berry! Over there!" He pointed at a tree-bush off in the corner.

*ZOOOM!* And Applejack was over there in the blink of an eye.

Applejack: "ZAP APPLES! CELESTIA BE PRAISED!"

Grundle: "Special! Only one tree. Once, they grew all around. Now, just one tree." He shrugged. "You know Rainbow Berries?"

*ZOOM!* And Applejack was right back next to him.

Applejack: "These things only grow but once a year! An' there's all kind'a special things you gotta do to harvest 'em just right, make 'em taste just right.."

Grundle: "One time a year? Odd. This grow all the time. Once had many orchards of these, we did. Rainbow Berries were gift from.." He scratched his chin, trying to remember. "..Grundle forget! But were gift long ago. Grundles care for them. When we flee, we leave orchard behind."

K: "That explains a lot.. your grandmother must've found the orchard the Zap Apple Trees used to grow in.. meaning.. Everfree Forest is, in fact, the overgrown remnants of the Grundle Orchards.. combined with the forest near Dream Castle.. throw in several thousand years, some self-preservation adaptations of the trees themselves.. and you get Zap Apples that only bear fruit around the most convenient time of year for them to try and take root and grow into new trees."

Dr. Allcome: "A fascinating theory, K. Are you sure you've never had any real science education?" He cocked a brow at me, in interest.

K: "Basic high school and some college. Nothing theoretical or overly advanced. It's just a hobby of mine." I shrugged.

Applejack: "Mah.. goodness.." She had one in her hoof.. and took a gentle bite of it. Tears poured from her eyes. "So good.. better'n ours, even.. Granny would flip!"

Grundle: "I have many! You take. I give. Grundles give when Grundles can. Grundle could never eat them all himself." He chuckles. "Make tongue all rainbow-y."

Applejack: "You, sir, just became mah new best pal!" She gave him a hug and went and picked a few Zap Apples.

Sunshine: "I'm sorry.. about the whole wanting to shoot you thing." He shrugged, scratching the back of his neck with his right fetlock sheepishly.

Grundle: "Is okay. Grundle is old. Shoot maybe faster than body wear-out. Am last. Me gone, world not very sad."

Dr. Allcome: "I beg to differ! Your death will mark the extinction of a sentient species - that's a tragedy in and of itself. There's so much I want to learn from you.." He sat, wide-eyed. "Please!"

Grundle: "Talk is free! Grundle talk all you like."

Another piece of the puzzle.. and a fascinating one. The last of his kind, Grundle represented another lost part of Equestria's history. How did it fit in with the Rainbow of Light? What secrets did Grundle have, that I could use to save the rest of the world? And what really started the legend that made everyone fear them?

Did it have something to do with Everfree Forest?

I was determined to find out.

{End of Part 3}

Part 4: Harmony

TIME: 06:33 ERST
DATE: War Day 181
LOCATION: Grundle Cavern, Beneath Dream Castle

We spent the rest of the day just exploring the rest of what I now called Grundle Cavern, camping out in his fields, and rising the next morning. The grave sites of the ancient Grundles were here, along with a monument to King Hugo. Hugo the Great had lived and raised the expatriate Grundles in peace. I thought it a blessing that he never had to see the chaos that unfolded after his demise.

The cave was extensive, and could have easily supported a thousand Grundles. According to Grundle, they never had anywhere near that many. Population decline was brought about not by disease, but by the after effects of the Dark Magic. What crushed me was finding out that because of whatever magic was used, most of the Grundles that were born, became feral beasts. No mind, no intelligence, no spark of life. Whatever had been used against them, had corrupted their very DNA.

The "Dark Grundles" were long gone, now, though. What became of them, Grundle didn't know. He only knew that they left the cavern, and never came back. A blessing for their parents. Eventually, it came down to just Grundle's mother and father - like him, they had no names. Their graves were marked "Grundle Mommy" and "Grundle Daddy" very simply. It seemed that the generation before them, had names. But as the last mating pair of Grundles was born, no names were given. As though the parents had given up hope.

Grundle himself was accepting of his fate. He was already over 80 years old - he wasn't sure exactly how old - and he knew his time was short. Dr. Allcome took a very personal interest in recording all of his history down. Every tall tale, every historical note, every personal experience. Pinkie's party went a long way to cheering him up - it was the first time since the death of his parents that he'd cried. And the first time he'd ever cried for joy.

When I urged Sunshine, I found out that the main legend had apparently come from a Unicorn source, and somehow had gotten absorbed into the standing orders of the Royal Guard under Celestia and Luna when they first took the throne, however that happened. We questioned history's accuracy now. It was.. corrupt somehow. The truth had long been buried under a sea of lies.

The ponies of 15th Company were let in on the secret. None of them questioned me or the Girls when we said that Grundle posed them no threat. They acted surpried that a creature such as him, even existed.

The big test was the Princesses. I picked near-dawn as the time to send them an urgent letter..

K: "..and we humbly request your presence, as this may have shocking effects on all of Pony society. Signed, General K."

Spike: "Got it." He rolled it up into its little bundle, and snorted flame to it, sending it on its way.

Grundle: "Pony Princess not hurt Grundle?"

K: "I'd die first." I said, sternly.

And just in case, I made sure the hammer on the M-19 was cocked - I may only get one shot. Celestia was smart, cagey, and despite the revelation that she had been behind a huge historical coverup, I wouldn't put it past her to try something. Luna? I was fairly certain Luna was more loyal to me at this point, than her sister. We had a "kid" together - Starlight Mint - and while Mint wasn't her own flesh and blood, Luna doted on her, and I could see the pain in her eyes.. Starlight was a karmic replacement for her lost foal.

Twilight: "Should we.. take up defensive positions? Just in case?" She looked at me, worried.

K: "Twilgiht, some times I wonder about you." I nodded to the 15th Company Captain. "Captain, disperse your men. I don't think Her Highness would try anything, but.. just in case, I don't want anyone hurt if she tries something."

Captain of 15th Comapny: "Do you distrust our Liege that much, General?" He gave the order anyway.

K: "Let's just say.. when it comes to history, Her Royal Highness has a less-than-stellar track record." I shrugged. "We're probably worrying over nothing, though."

About ten minutes later, I could hear hooves. They were marching calmly, which put my mind at ease. Unless they were being stupid, they would be rushing to take positions and cover different angles, just like I taught them. What shocked me was seeing Princess Cadence accompanying Luna and Celestia.

K: "Princesses." I bowed slightly. Celestia's mood was neutral. Luna, of course, was happy to see me, and..

Starlight Mint: "DADDY!" She flew from behind Luna's mane and jumped a clear 15 feet to tackle me.

K: *OOoof!* I hit the ground hard. "Hello, Sweetie." I gave her a hug. "So, I take it you're happy to hear of the last living Grundle, Princess?" I asked, looking at Celestia.

Celestia: "More.. curious that they exist, still. I'd understood that they had been eradicated." Her tone was plain and neutral.

Luna: "When we read your letter, we weren't sure what to think. A Grundle? There aren't even any old mare's tales of such things. Besides myself and my sister, we didn't think anyone knew they existed." She shrugged.

Cadence: "Well, I for one am happy to see such a miracle." She nodded to us. "Hello, Twlight."

Twilight: "Hello, Cadence.. it's been a while. I'm sorry."

Cadence: "Oh, don't worry about it. I'm just glad you're alright. Your brother's love keeps me warm at night, but we do worry about you."

K: "Speaking of, where is he?" I didn't see him among the troops.

Celestia: "Shining Armor has a bit of a cold, so Princess Cadence put him to bed. He'll be fine."

Grundle: "I am Grundle. That is my name, that is what I am. Please! Come, eat, enjoy. Grundle give, happy now, to make friends."

The squad of Royal Guards - just one, Celestia's personal squad - and the Princesses came down and we all went to Grundle's cabin. It was one of the last few structures still standing. Ambrosia was working on it - she couldn't stand the state of disrepair it was in, and construction was her life. Even if she was a deadly shot with a Chaffee. It was why I picked her for the Expedition specifically.

Starlight Mint: "Oooo.. pretty cave! Pretty plants!" She hopped and skipped around and messed with things.

K: "Be careful, sweetheart. And watch out for the red apple-looking things, they're spicy." I pointed to them.

Starlight Mint: "No problem!" She beamed a grin, and scurried about.

Luna: *Giggle* "She's having a ball." She smiled warmly.

K: "Yeah." I put my arm around her. "She's got the heart of a warrior, but she's still just a foal." I smiled. "Let her play. There's nothing here that can hurt her - we checked."

Luna: "I trust you." She kissed me on the cheek, just as Applejack came up. "Oh! Applejack.."

Applejack: "Mhm.. ah see how it is." She pulled me down to her level and gave me a French Kiss. Slow, passionate.. and she pulled away VERY slowly. "Remember who's yer Leadin' Mare."

K: *Cough* "Well, if Katrina was here, she'd have something to say about that, too." I smiled. I wasn't going to mention that I was hard as a rock and I'd easily do them both right here, right now, if it wasn't for witnesses. "Come on, you two."

Applejack: "Nothin' doin'! I'm gon' go watch Starlight." She smirked. "Ah DO play with Apple Bloom ever' now an' again." And she trotted off.

Luna: *Giggle* "And this is what a harmnious family looks like, My Dear One." She nuzzled me as we went to Grundle's cabin.

Inside the cabin, Grundle served us tea and snacks while Pinkie and Rarity were busy getting the place cleaned up from Pinkie's party. The talk we had was mainly questions between Celestia and answers from Dr. Allcome. Luna was more interested in Grundle himself. Cadence spent most of the time looking at everything, asking occasional questions, but mainly listening in on the conversations. The guards.. spent time jaw-jacking with the ponies of 15th Company. War scuttlebutt and things like that - soldiers talk, it's what they do.

Celestia: "Well.. this has been very informative. I would like to extend an invitation to you, Grundle, to come to the castle with us. I would like to learn so much more of you, and try to extend our hospitality. I know it can't make up for what happened all those years ago, and I really wish I'd known what was occuring.." She looked at me sympathetically. "Mother.. didn't exactly like us mixing with other ponies, never mind other creatures."

K: "I understand."

Grundle: "Grundle be happy! Grundle never see outside of Cave." He actually smiled.

K: "Alright, it's decided. Grundle, don't worry. No one's going to hurt you." I nodded to him.

Celestia: "I guarantee it." She nodded to him, as well.

Grundle: "Okay! Let Grundle get ready!" He paused a moment, and flapped his arms. "Me ready!"

K: "Well, if we have nothing left to do here, I'll have the expedition head towards where Paradise Estates used to be, to see if we can find any clues there." I shrugged.

Celestia: "Did you find anything specific here?" She queried.

K: "Only a carved wooden toy with one of the Williams children's names on it. Looked hand-crafted." I shrugged.

Luna: "Well. Keep us apprised of the situation." She nodded.

K: "Alright." I stepped outside, and called. "Applejack! Starlight! We're talking off! Come say goodbye to Daddy! He's going to miss you!" *OOF!*

I really need to stop doing that.

Starlight: "I'm'a miss you, too, Daddy!" She kissed my cheek. "Be careful!"

K: "I'll try, sweetheart." *Ahem* "Now, can you get off of Daddy? He has an expedition to run."

Starlight: "Okay.." She slid off of me, and I picked her up, giving her a hug.

K: "You be careful, too. I don't care what your Cutie Mark says, you're my little girl.." Did I really mean that? I did. It scared me. "..I don't want you getting hurt. Listen to Mommy Luna while I'm gone."

Starlight: "You bet, Daddy!" She kissed my cheek again, and I handed her off to Luna.

Luna: "I will watch our foal, My General." She gave me a wink.

K: "Good." I blinked, she nuzzled me. "Yeah.. our foal." I smiled as Sunshine Smile paced up.

Sunshine: "We're ready to go, General." He shrugged.

K: "Alright, let's do this. War waits for nopony." I nodded.

I was becoming more and more integrated into pony life as time went on. And you know what? I was starting to not care. Oh, I still had the idea that some more was going on here than I first thought - I mean, the very idea that tragedy could be mentally erased was still suspicious to me, but at the same time, I wasn't sure how to ask about that. I'd wait until our investigation of the Dream Valley area ended, before I decided to ask such things of Celestia. It might not even be her doing - Galactica Spark seemed to be in the middle of just about everything.

And while nothing linked directly to her, the mysteries, like errant baseballs, kept landing in her yard.

For the sake of the stuff in the castle that we DID find, I insisted we take the rest of the day to plunder the castle of anything not bolted down or on fire. Every scrap would be sent to the Royal University and other places that specialized in archaeology, and see if they could glean any clues from the bits and fragments we uncovered.

The next day, we were up and at 'em. As we moved through the forest at a liesurely pace, I sent Fluttershy, Sunshine and Dash ahead as scouts. Just because the area seemed quiet, didn't mean anything. After all, the most peaceful scenarios can often end up being the most dangerous.

Twilight: "K.. I've been thinking.." She trailed off, in thought.

K: "Go for it, Twi." I nodded to her.

Twilight: "Well, Tirek's been using all of Ancient Ponyland's enemies against us, right?" She looked over to me as she paced along.

K: "Yeah.." I nodded.

Twilight: "Well, he may know our recent history.. what if he used some of our more recent enemies?" She tilted her head at me, questioningly.

K: "You mean Equestria hasn't been all sunshine and cupcakes for the last century or more?" Okay, that was very sarcastic of me.

Rarity: "Really!" *Huff*

Twilight: "Well, it hasn't, but.. well, it's never been quite this bad." She shrugged.

K: "You better fill me in." I nodded as we walked.

Twilight: "Most recent? Was before I was born, when my parents were still foals. Equestria fought a war with Kianga.." She shrugged. "It was a senseless conflict over borders and trade. The war went on for ten years, but achieved nothing. It's part of the reason the military was so downsized. A cabal of senior guards pushed for the war to continue, constantly promising victory, but achiveing nothing." She continued. "Before that, Equestria was in a war with Germaneigh - that was a pony-on-pony conflict. There were also ancient wars against the Camels, and the Zebra.."

K: "Race war is a regular thing with you, isn't it?!" I demanded. This was sounding a lot like Earth - and not in a good way.

Rarity: "I'm afraid it was, darling.. WAS. We don't do such things any more - why, I know of several Taurus and Goats that make a fine living-"

K: "Outside of Equestria." I interjected.

Rarity: "Well, yes, but-"

K: "Then you still haven't accepted other races into your culture." I said, sternly.

Twilight: "Well, what about Earth?" She asked, a little annoyed at my admittedly big-headed hubris.

K: "If you want to draw comparisons, then yes, we still have conflict between humans for stupid reasons - but the nation I come from, America, at least on paper, everyone is equal under the law of the land. They can't be discriminated against for any reason." I shrugged. "Culturally? We're just about there, too. Took us a hundred years. But our nation is only two hundred years old. You guys have had a LOT longer than we have - and in antiquity, everyone got along. I was there, I saw it. I saw a wolf puppy that lived with ponies, he was their friend.. his name was Havoc."

The Girls: *Shriek of shock*

K: "Oh, dear God, what did I say this time?" *Sigh*

Twilight: "The Great Havoc is.. he's supposed to be the king of all the Timberwolves!!"

Applejack: "No kiddin' - an' he's a surly one! Why, this one time, Granny Smith was in the woods-"

K: "..aren't we technically deep inside his territory?" I reminded.

That brought guns up, bolts cocking and magazines checked.

K: *Sigh* "Oh, dear sweet zombie Jesus.." I stopped. "Company halt!"

Everyone stopped.

Dr. Allcome: "Uh.. General.. I'm really not a military man, but.. should we stop here? I mean, it's dangerous.." He nervously trailed off.

K: "I'm sure that everything's fine." I turned to face them. "Ever since I've gotten here, and seen behind the gilded veil of happiness at the real Equestria, the way this world really works, I've seen superstition, racism, conflict, hatred - all the sins I thought I'd be getting away from. Sometimes weaker, but sometimes, much stronger-"

Dr. Allcome: "Ah.. General.."

K: "-don't interrupt me, Doc. Now, as I was saying, I've had it up to here with this hokey stuff. I don't know why I'm still stuck here, outside of Discord playing with me, but I was once directed by an etherial creature to settle an arguement between your Princesses, and that creature's word were to heal your problems. Well, by God, I'm going to do just-"

Twilight: "Uh, K.." She backed away a bit.

K: "-not you, too, Twilight. Please. I'm on a rant here. As I was saying-"

Spike: "K!!" He was getting behind Twilight, and in front of Rarity.

K: "Oh, for goodness sakes, what is it?!" I flapped my arms.

Applejack: "Be'hind'ya.." She pointed behind me.

K: "I'm sure it's nothing!" I turned around.

And there standing in front of me was the largest pack of Timberwolves I had ever seen. Fifty in number, at least, led by the largest single Timberwolf I'd ever laid eyes on. Around his neck was a piece of cloth, and a large necklace. All of them.. they were just staring at us. Like dinner.

K: "I'm sure we're doomed!" I said, with a look of absolute shock on my face.

LOCATION: Everfree Forest, Old Kingdom Area, Near Paradise Estates

Standing between the ponies and the Timberwolves, was just me. One step between one and perdition.. it scared me. But I refused to show fear. They weren't attacking us, for some reason. And whatever that reason was, I knew it was important.. something about that scrap of cloth.. reminded me of a bandanna.

K: "...Havoc?" I leaned in a bit.

Giant Timerwolf: *Grrr*

K: "Havoc. You're Havoc." I blinked.

Applejack: "Ah.. Honeybun.." *Quivering* "Don't jes' stan' there!"

K: "Wait. They're not attacking us.. there's a reason." I waved a hand back at the team.

Rarity: "Should we perhps-"

K: "Shh!" I shushed her. "Havoc.. do you remember me? The one who came from the future, to try to save Ponyland? Megan and Danny's friend?" I held my arms out. I was wearing the same outfit as I was the last time he saw me.. if that WAS him.. "Don't you remember? Tex? Sweetheart? The other ponies?"

Giant Timberwolf: *Growr!* *Yip!*

K: "You can't talk, can you? Can you understand what I'm saying?" I looked into his eyes.

Giant Timberwolf: *Ruff!* Such a deep bark. Err.. vocalization.

K: "If you're really Havoc, you'll recognise this."

I pulled out Danny's wooden horse from Applejacks' saddle bag, which contained a few other clues we'd found. That made him sit. Like a trained canine. He just sat there. Looking at the horse. One of the other Timberwolves looked like he was going to move in on us, but the lead Timberwolf shot him a look, and he backed off.

K: "Twilight. Come here." I urged, calmly.

Twilight: "Yes.. K.." She was afraid, it showed in her voice.

K: "Can you scan them to detect magical curses?" I said, calmly, looking the Giant Timberwolf right in the eyes, never removing my gaze from him.

Twilight: "I can try.."

K: "Make it happen." I instructed. "Everyone else, stay calm. Safeties on. No sudden moves."

Octavia: "You heard him. Safeties." She clicked hers on.

Lyra: "Ah'd never thought Ah'see tha day.." She shook her head.

Twilight: "Oh.. kay.. Havoc? Is that your name?" She addressed the largest one.

Giant Timberwolf: *Yip*

Twilight: "I'm going to scan you to see if you're under the effects of a curse. This will not hurt, but it might feel funny."

Giant Timberwolf: *Growf!* That was more.. frustration?

K: "I think he's saying that's kind of silly.. do it anyway, I want answers." I nodded slowly.

Twilight: "Alright."

She let her horn glow. A pinkish hue.. the light bathed the Giant Timberwolf gently, the magic pouring over every bit of his bark.. I watched this intently. It took Twilight a few minutes to complete her scan, then consult one of her magic books.

Twilight: "It's a curse alright." She nodded. "That amulet around his neck is the source of it. But.."

K: "But?"

Twilight: "It's a double-edged curse. On the one hand, it's keeping him in that form. On the other hand.. it's allowing him to control the other Timberwolves of the group. Like some kind of automatic dominance thing. They won't question him as long as he has that necklace on. But if he ever takes it off.." She trailed off.

K: "Havoc.. did you put that on, intentionally?" I gently tilted my head towards him.

Havoc: *YIP!*

K: "Did you do it to protect the forest?" I gently glanced at it.

Havoc: *Grr*

K: "Did you do it to protect Dream Valley from the other Timberwolves?" I turned my head slightly.

Havoc: *YIP!*

K: "Okay... I think I understand now. Sugarheart told me the other Timberwolves didn't want anything to do with Havoc because he made friends with the ponies, but.. his parents wouldn't let them harm the ponies, either. It was an uneasy peace, but the ponies were working very hard to make friends with them. I'm only guessing - something went wrong?" I shrugged, gently, again.

Havoc: *YIP!*

K: "Are there other Timberwolves out there, besides these?" I nodded.

Havoc: *YIP!*

K: "If you took that necklace off.. would you fall over dead from extreme age or something?" I tilted my head.

Havoc: *Grrr* I think that was a no.

K: "Havoc? If I promised you that you and anyone else that comes willingly, would be welcome in Equestria, and that we can handle the others, would you take off the necklace?" I nodded right to him.

Havoc: *YIP!*

K: "You want to come back to the ponies, don't you? - Octavia, defensive formation."

Octavia: "On it." She spread the Rangers out, and pulled the Elements to defensive positions. I could see Applejack out of the corner of my eye.

Havoc: *YIP*

K: "Okay, Havoc.. come over to my side, slowly, and bring anyone that would come with you willingly..."

My heart was racing. This was going to happen fast.. Havoc moved over to where I was, followed by perhaps a few more than a dozen others.

K: "Octavia?" I wasn't removing my gaze from Havoc.

Octavia: "Ready." I could hear her pull out her Flare Gun and load it. "Do it, K."

I knelt down, making sure I had a stable firing position, gently pawed my underarm holster, popping the leather strap off the M-19 with my right hand, and cocking the hammer as my left hand crossed over my chest and grasped the necklace around Havoc's neck.

K: "When I pull, hit the ground, don't move." I whispered to him.

Havoc: *Whine* He didn't like this, but he understood.

K: "Three.. two.. one!"

I pulled the necklace with my left hand, as I drew with my right.

A magical burst of energy went off like a flash grenade. The Timberwolves that were part of Havoc's pack materialized back into their fleshy forms.. and we had about forty-five hungry wolves staring at us. I fired one round into the air. The .357 Magnum round made a nice loud boom, making the newly-fleshified wolves back off a little.

K: "EVERY ONE OF YOU, BACK OFF, NOW!" I rolled on my back, M-19 aimed at the next-largest one.

Timberwolf: "We're.. mortal again!" It looked right at me. "Ah, the pleasures of the flesh..!"

He wasn't going to listen, I could see that, just by the hungry look in his eyes.

K: "Yeah, no. Fuck it. OPEN FIRE!"

I wasn't worried about the others, I was worried about the fact that I was the most forward. I emptied the M-19 into five different targets, the BOOM of the magnum revolver, loaded with Remington Gold Saber, struck five wolves, and killed five wolves. At first, they had the same reaction the Raptorians did when they first got shot at - they freaked out and froze in place. But only for a moment. They recovered and charged at us before I'd finished shooting.

K: "HAVOC! RUN THE OTHER WAY!"

I yelled, as I fired my last round, my thumb jamming on the cylinder release as I tilted the cylinder back and tapped the cylinder ejector rod with one hand. I reached over, pulled one of Colonel Williams' speed loaders out, and jammed it in the chamber, pressing the release, tilting it forwards. I pulled the speedloader back, and pressed the cylinder shut with the palm of that hand. I looked up to see a Timberwolf about to have my intestines for lunch, and felt something pull my collar. HARD. Yanking me away just in time to avoid the snap of lupine jaws, which I countered by extending my arm all the way out, and pressing the barrel to its forehead. I pulled the trigger with all my might, and the explosion of brain matter that followed told me, that threat was ended.

I didn't bother to look up, I emptied the last five rounds in the cylinder at another five targets. They were thinning fast - automatic weapons tend to do that, and most of the other ponies in the group, had them. Right towards the end, Dash, Sunshine and Fluttershy showed up, and flanked them from the right-rear, pounding them with additional gunfire. I heard yelps and yips, blood flying all over the place from bullets impacting flesh. Once the last one I could see, went down, I heard Octavia..

Octavia: "CEASE FIRE! CEASE FIRE! LYRA, BROSE (Ambrosia), COVER THE LEFT! SCRATCH, ON ME! A-J, HOLD THIS POSITION!"

Applejack: "Right!"

Rarity: "We're fine!"

Twilight: "No problem."

I could hear them all give affirmatives.. everyone. Then, who was dragging me?

Havoc: "I had to pull your fat from the fire.." I heard over my shoulder as I was released. A big pink tongue slobbered my face right afterwards.

K: *ACKPTH!* "Alright! Alright!" I sat up. Havoc put his head on my shoulder. He was all grown up.

Havoc: "Miss me?"

K: "Maybe." I scratched him behind the ears. "Depends if you missed me or not."

Havoc: "I missed all of you." He hugged me with his forepaws.

K: "Alright, then! Applejack, everyone, this is Havoc - the domesticated Timberwolf."

Pinkie Pie: "Wow!" She zoomed over to inspect him, finally glomphing his big, fluffy tail. "FLUFFY!!"

Havoc: "She likes me?"

K: "She likes everyone that's likeable." I shrugged. "I have so many questions.."

Havoc: "I won't be much help. I had to take over control of the Timberwolves not that long after you left.. Megan still had control of the Rainbow of Light at the time. I don't know what she did with it."

K: "So, you know why we're here?"

Havoc: "I've been stalking the woods between Dream Castle and Paradise Estates. This was the realm of my pack.." He looked at the others that had sided with him of their own free will. "..what remains of us. I took up the mantle of the Alpha Wolf - that necklace - because all the wolves in the forest were being turned into living tree-wolves. We never found out what caused it, but.. I used my power to keep them at bay, keep them away from Dream Valley. As the years went by, things happened.. most of it's a foggy haze, but I remember.. war. Strife. Discontent. Eventually, Dream Castle and Paradise Estates were abandoned, along with Coltonville.."

K: "Coltonville.. Generation Two." I nodded. "Well, the end of Generation One.. depending who you ask." I shrugged.

Havoc: "Megan stopped coming around long before Ponytown was founded." He sat on his haunches. "Is that the gun that Mister Williams gave you?"

K: "Yeah.." I looked at the gently smoking barrel and idly reloaded the weapon. "..so, Ponytown was real."

Havoc: "Yeah. But it was abandoned.. so very long ago." He shook his head. "..then, some time later, ponies returned to the area."

K: "Ponyville."

Havoc: "I tried to protect the area around it, but there are so many other Tree-Wolf packs.. and a short time ago, someone created some from the actual trees!"

K: "Grogar did that."

Havoc: "Grrrrrrogar!" He snorted. "He's still alive!"

K: "Sorry, but yes. And Tirek is back. He seems to be the one behind all of this." I shrugged.

Havoc: "I see." He lowered his head. "Give me a minute." He paced over to the wolves that had come to his side.

Applejack: "..and I was afriad o' that?" She *Hmpf!*'ed. "He's jes' a big ol' puppy!"

K: "Enemies can turn out to be friends in disguise." I sniffed. "Not all, but some."

Applejack: "Mm.." She put her forelegs around me. "..y'scared me again." She kissed my cheek. "You know how I feel about that."

K: "Yeah, well.. just doing my job." I finished loading the speed loaders from the box of bullets that Colonel Williams had provided me.

Havoc came back over, and nodded to me.

Havoc: "Well, we would be greatful to accept your hospitality. My mate especially.. when the transformation happend, she was with pup. And apparently, still is." He made a small shrug. "We're very curious about what happened to our people.. but we made this choice willingly. We knew what would happen.. we did it to keep our people safe."

K: "I understand." I looked over at Sunshine, who was getting a report from Octavia, and to Twilight, who was investigating the amulet.

Twilight: "Fascinating amulet. I've never seen anything like this before. Where did you get it?" She held it up.

Havoc: "It was given to me.. like I said, we made a choice." He nodded.

K: "Who gave it to you?"

Havoc: "An old woman.. though I've come to believe she might have been Somnambula, in disguise." He shrugged. "Though, at the time, I didn't care. I just wanted.."

K: "I understand." I gave him a hug. "It's alright."

Twilight: "Who's Somnambula?"

K: "Another old nemesis. She derived her power from stealing the youth of others - her main powers were the ability to create illusions and make them tangible. She was pretty much useless without the hypnotic abilities of her canary - Kyrie - who she kept prisoner. My only guess is, by making the Timber Wolves ageless, she somehow 'sealed' their youth away." I shrugged. "If that's the case, she might be the one behind all the Timber Wolves. The living ones, at least, not the ones Grogar created from dead trees."

Havoc: "Do you think she could have lived this long? We must've been.. like that.. for thousands of years." He sighed.

K: "Near as I can figure, Ancient Ponyland was about twelve thousand years ago, and Coltonville was at least ten thousand years ago." I nodded.

Twilight: "It's MY best guess, based on the age of the ruins of Dream Castle.. the original ones. Princess Luna and Celestia made it their home at one point." She shook her head.

Applejack: "And yew expect Paradise Estates to have anything left?" She tilted her head.

K: "Well, the oldest human settlements are about that age, and we have found some things from that time. What fascinates me, though, is the Coltonville Era had - according to the cartoon, at least - very high technology. I wonder if the whole schism between Galactica Spark and her daughters.. if that caused some kind of apocalypse?" I shrugged.

Twilight: "It would explain the World Barriers." She nodded sagely.

K: *Flatly* "What world barriers?" This reminded me that I'd spent my time running a war, not learning history.

Rainbow Dash: "Oh, come on! Everyone knows about the World Barriers! That's pre-school stuff! Not even - it's nursery rhyme material! Babies know about it! Why-"

Everyone was giving her a strange look.. in fact, the strangest look I'd ever seen.

Rarity: *Ahem* "The world barriers are a rough field of energy that encircles the known world.. so far as we know. The rest of the planet beyond it, is inacessable. But it's said that the barriers didn't always exist." She shrugged a little. "Actually, if you believe some of the stories, the barriers encircle a rather small area - and actually protect us from what lies outside of it. Whatever that may be - tales range from monsters the size of castles, to vicious beasts of the shadows."

K: "That was very informative, Rarity-"

Rarity: "But also that an incredible treasure of the rarest gems ever seen by pony eyes exists on the other side! Oh, I've dreamed of it since I was a filly!" *Squee* "It gives me goosebumps just thinking about it!"

K: "..figures."

Havoc: "Is she always like this?" He grinned.

K: "No, no, some times she's down for a wild tea party." I smirked.

Rarity: "You know very well I have the finest tea parties in all of Ponyville!" *Huff*

K: "You're tied with The Doctors. It's all over the Society pages." I pulled out the latest edition of Ponyville's newspaper (hey, you gotta have something to read when you pinch a loaf), and handed her the society section: 'Rarity: Is The War Ruining Fashion?'

Rarity: *SHRIEK!* "HOW DARE THEY!" *Huff* "I'll show them.." She pulled out a notepad and started writing.

K: "Her image is very important to her. But it's important to us as well - we like to see her sitting high and pretty. It's her thing. She wouldn't be Rarity if she wasn't the queen bee of Ponyville society." I shrugged.

Havoc: "I see." He nodded. "Reminds me of a few of my old friends."

K: "Well, we need to get to Paradise Estates.. or, whatever's left of it." I shook my head.

Sunshine: "It should be just up ahead, if your map is accurate, K." He nodded.

K: "Havoc?" I looked to him.

Havoc: "Not that far. Twenty minutes at a slow pace." He shrugged.

K: "Spike!"

Spike: "Yeah?" He was staring at Havoc.

Havoc: "You remind me of another baby dragon, I once knew." He smiled.

K: "Message time." I pulled out my own note pad, wrote a quick message on it, and handed it to Spike. "Burn off, please." I bribed him with a strip of Turkey Jerky. "Postage."

Spike: "A dragon could get used to this." He munched the jerky first, and then burned off the message.

K: "Alright, Havoc. Wait here - I asked Princess Celestia to have an old friend of mine come over and pick you guys up. Get you all away from Ponyville.. just in case."

Havoc: "Alright. Will I see you again?"

K: "Regularly." I gave him another hug, and ruffled his ears.

Havoc: "Awesome."

With that, the Expedition departed for Paradise Estates. Based on the information we had gained in Dream Castle, we knew the place would be at least ten thousand years old - the Great Pyramids were only about four thousand years old, so in Earth terms, I may as well be visiting one of the very first civilized regions of the world - Samarran, Mesopotamian or Boian eras. The dawn of human civilization was about 15,000 years ago.. for the Ponies, it seemed, it was much longer.

I hoped that whatever was at Paradise Estates, it would bring at least some answers to the multitude of questions the Expedition had raised so far. Of course, it might be asking too much, but getting Somnambula, too, would be a bonus.
