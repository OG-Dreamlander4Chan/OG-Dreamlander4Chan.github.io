   Biggest scandal ever to hit Canterlot Jr. High

       Student caught sending Nudes of one student to other students

       You're in charge of Home Room the day after the scandal breaks.

       With the affected student, and the suspect's best friend, Silver Spoon.

       The affected student - Applebloom - is sitting off in the corner with her friends.

       She looks dead inside. Three stages beyond humiliated.

       Time to address the class...

       "Alright, everyone.. attention, please." You raise a hand to get them looking at you. "I have something very serious to discuss with you all."

       Applebloom looks ready to die. You can't help but feel for her.

       "As you might've noticed, Diamond Tiara isn't in class today." They're looking, now. "She was arrested last night.. federal child pornography charges." The images were all over the internet - the FBI got involved. "If convicted, she's facing ten years minimum in a federal prison, and will be forced to register as a Sex Offender for the rest of her life." You start looking over the rows of students, looking for eyes. "I've been asked to inform all of you that anyone caught with these images, will be reported to the police, and expelled from school. You'll be charged the same way Diamond Tiara was." It was harsh, you knew it, but that's the culture we live in today. Zero tolerance. "I've also been asked to ask all of you to report anyone who has these images." And because they have to know what they're being punished for.. "The images are of a fellow student at this school." ..but because of privacy laws, not whom. "Starting today, there's a new policy in the school..." Here comes the hammer.

       "Starting today, Students are prohibited from taking pictures of other students for any reason and possessing those images on any electronic device in the school. If you want to take pictures at a ball game or something, that's fine, but you may not possess those images inside the school building. In addition, all students are prohibited from posting ANY images of ANY other students on any social media websites." You didn't think this was right - that it was an invasion of their private lives outside the setting of the school, but there were some parents that were completely batshit insane over this. You know - you had to talk to a few of them. "Anyone found in violation of these policies after today will face a three-day out of school suspension, mandatory, for the first offense. Second offense is five days with an expulsion hearing. Third offense is mandatory expulsion and recommendation to be sent to Herders Lane Correctional Educational Facility." A 'special' school for the bad kids.

       The little shits start to bitch and moan about how this isn't fair.

       "HEY! HEY!" *Shrill whistle* "QUIET DOWN!" You clear your throat and continue. "I don't like this any more than you do, but this is school policy, and I have no choice but to enforce it. This is a Zero Tolerance Rule. And yes, you can expect that school staff will be checking your social media accounts. Which reminds me.." Over to a stack of papers.. and you pick them up and put a stack on the front-corner of each row. "..pass these back, please." You continue. "The school is.. requesting.. that every student fill out these forms. You will list your social media accounts and either the ending URL or the account name." This part really rumbled your jamberoos. "Obviously, we can't force you to be absolutely truthful, but it's in your best interests to do so."

       More complaints. More.

       "Okay, boys and girls, listen up - I want all of you to take this as a lesson.." Time to educate these kids. For REAL. Not just fact-stuffing, but teaching them to think like educated, opinionated human adults. "..you don't like these policies, right? You think they're a load of bunk? That's good - BE mad. And remember this for the rest of your lives. The people we elect into public office - the PTA, the city administration, and so on - they're the ones that come up with these policies. If you don't want your kids to grow up having to deal with these same sorts of rules and policies, don't elect the people that would enact them, get active and talk to your peers - other parents, and child guardians - and convince them to settle down and back off. Remember that we live in a country where we ELECT people to handle OUR business FOR us - THEY serve US, not the other way around, and if they start putting in policies you disagree with, either find someone that'll repeal them and elect them, or step up to the plate, take responsibility, and do it yourself." You nod, as the students are writing.

       Some of them.. at least.. you got through to some of them.. you were sure of that.

       Now, though, you had to deal with the fallout from this incident. And be ever-watchful for infringements of the rules. Fortunately, it was friday, and the students would have a chance to delete all the offending images over the weekend.
       You KNEW, though, that mixed in with the ones you reached, there were statist bootlickers that reveled in the loss of their freedoms, troublemakers that would find a way around the rules, genuinely social kids that would be socially stunted by this, and some kids that just won't care.
       Then, there was Applebloom - and others like her - that these rules were designed to protect.. but would they even matter?

       Your usual educational beat is Social Studies. Really, it's just a history class, but they call it Social Studies for whatever reason.
       Your passion is history, so, this works out.
       Currently, the 6th grade students were in the middle of the lesson about the Magna Carta and the concept of representation and representational governments where the rulers are beholden to the people, not the other way around.
       Heretical as it may seem in the extremely "progressive" (American Liberal) institution that is teaching, you deliberately use this incident as a way to point out the excesses of the ruling elite by substituting this incident for something else, and "What If'ing" the scenario to modern day - the famous "Let them eat cake" line, and how that would play out in Social Media these days, and what the fallout from that would be.



       Lunch time. Thank fuck. The principal wanted a lunch meeting with the Home Room teachers to discuss this incident.
       You're the first to arrive - you packed a cold lunch today, you knew the stuff was going to hit the oscillating device.

       "Principal Cheerilee." You give her a nod as you walk into the Multi-Purpose Room.
       "Anon." She gives you a nod in return. "Give it a minute, the others will be arriving here, soon."
       "Right." You took a seat and quickly pulled out your meal, to wolf it down as fast as possible, to give you the most possible time to make your voice heard.
       After all, isn't that what you're teaching these little stinkers?


       The other teachers file on in. They don't look happy at all.
       They all take their seats, chatting among themselves about this issue already - which in itself could be a technical violation of the student's privacy, but you like to pick your battles.

       "Alright, everyone." Ms. Cheerilee starts in. "I want to know how the students took to the new rule changes and how they reacted to the situation. Mr. Mous has both the victim and the offending student-"
       "Suspect." You correct her. She hasn't been convicted of anything yet, and was technically not expelled at this time.
       "- in his Home Room. So, we'll start with you."

       You get an immediate 'look' from Mr. Davenport. Oh, how he hated you. Complete polar opposite in politics.

       "They complained. Really hard. I mean, it was mostly rabble rousing, but there were complaints. Two students refused to fill out the forms immediately and wanted to bring them home to their parents.." You give Mr. Davenport a look back. "..which is completely understandable, since I'm sure some of them are monitored when they go online, or they simply use family-wide accounts or something." A shrug as you finished your coffee. "Applebloom looked ready to die. Like, she wanted to have her brain physically explode. Silver Spoon.. when the news broke.."

       "Who's Silver Spoon?" The question came from Ms. Top.

       "The Suspect's best - and as far as I can tell - only friend."

       "Interesting that you know so much about the private lives of your charges, Mr. Mous." Came the charge from Mr. Davenport.

       "Shameful that you don't seem to care, Quill." You shot back.

       "Enough." Ms. Cheerilee interrupted the sniping duel. "Go on, Anon."

       "Anyway, when the news broke, Silver Spoon started erasing things from her phone. She looked humiliated. Terrified." You shrug and pour the last of your coffee from your thermos. "I let it go. I don't think she really understood how bad it was."

       "You should've seized the phone immediately, and turned her in to the police!" Mr. Davenport shot off.

       "And, what, turn her into a lifelong criminal and pariah?" You shrug. "I mean, I know the situation is serious, but would you want me to turn her into a criminal like that?"

       "They're ALL criminals." He retorted. "They just haven't been convicted, yet."

       "I'm glad you're not a cop, Quill." You cock a brow at him.

       "Enough, you two." Ms. Cheerilee broke you up again. "Anything else, Anon?"

       "Other than being able to use this scandal to teach a lesson, and Applebloom looking like her friends were circling the wagons to protect her.." A gentle hand gesture. "..there wasn't a riot, and I didn't see anyone with the images in question. There was no outright non-compliance with the rules, but a couple of students - as I said - want to defer to their parents." You nod to the rest of the teachers.

       "Well.. in MY class.." Davenport started. "..I caught two students with cell phones, and confiscated them. I'm eager to see if the police can get any evidence off of them." He gave you a smug look. "Troublemakers, anyway. Everyone filled out the forms after I made it clear it wasn't an option to refuse. I also drove the point home that this is what happens to lawbreakers, and admonished the student that committed the crime. Since she wasn't in my homeroom, I couldn't name her of course, but I laid into them about what she did. I think they got a little scared of the idea of federal prison.." He corrected his tie haughtily, and went for his sandwich.
        "I also warned them of the consequences of being a convicted child molester. That their lives would be ruined - and in some countries, they'd simply be executed for this." Mr. Davenport snorted a little as he ripped into his sandwich. "I drove the point home about how they're all being watched - that school staff WILL be keeping a VERY close eye on their internet postings, if found, and how they haven't any right to complain about this." Back to his food.

       "Don't cut yourself on all that edge, Quill. The school can't afford to go shopping at the Asshole Store for a replacement." You narrow your eyes at him.

       Ms. Top and a couple others chuckled. One looked horribly offended. Quill Davenport snarled at you.

       "ANON!" Ms. Cheerilee gave you a 'for shame' look.

       Really, the teachers were no better than High School students, some times. Ms. Cheerilee didn't have a lot of power over them, what with the way your contracts were constructed, but she could, at least, keep order in these meetings.
       Still, it was like trying to keep a High School class in order. And some of these teachers were in their 50's!  The others went on in their reports - most of them were more moderate than Quill Davenport, but he had his clique of Statist Bootlickers and fellow masochists that basically did the same as him. You idly wonder if they have cult meetings after school in the basement, where they sacrifice the science class pets to Ba'al or Slaneesh something. This gives you a bemused smirk for the rest of the meeting.

       Afterwards, it would be more class stuff, until you had to deal with a meeting of the Model U.N. after school. All the affected kids were a part of it. Diamond Tiara represented Russia and crafted a Russian New Money 'royalty' character for herself. Silver Spoon was Belarus. Applebloom was the United States. Her friend, Scootaloo, was Mexico. And her other friend, Sweetie Belle, was Canada.

       This was going to suck, or rock. One of the two.


       The Model U.N.
       Time to face the music.


       "Alright, everyone, have a seat." You had everything set up in your classroom.

       The U.N. Security Council was looking a little thin.. only the United States, England, and France were there.
       That was Dinky, Applebloom, and Twist.

       "Uh.. where's China?" You ask, addressing the students by the countries they represent.

       "Rumble? He got caught messin' with his cell phone by Mr. Davenport." Dinky reported. "I think he got in trouble - he got sent to the principal in third period, an' I haven't seen him since."

       "Well, that's great." You shrug. "For the moment, kids, we need a new Russia." You turn to Feather Weight. "Mr. Reporter, would you get out the voting forms, please? We're going to have to have a special selection for this." You had enough representatives for a basic Model U.N. You'd just have to shuffle one around from somewhere. "All representatives may apply." You nod to Twist. "As the head of the UNSC, since Russia also had the Secretary-General's position, you're in charge of handling the election." A side effect of not having QUITE enough students was that some of them had to dual-hat as key U.N. positions. Diamond Tiara was the Secretary-General.

       "Yeth, Mithter Mouth." She nods and takes up organizing this.

       You, meanwhile, excuse yourself to your office to call Ms. Cheerilee about Rumble Lane. You remember his big brother, Thunder, when he was in your class. That'd been your first year teaching. Thunder was a hard worker, and active in sports.. you didn't think Rumble had it in him.

       "Miss Cheerilee? It's Anon." You start in. "One of my Model U.N. students isn't here - Rumble Lane - he's on the Security Council, representing China. Do you know what happened to him? Dinky mentioned he was sent to The Office.."

       "O-oh.. yes.. uhm.. he's not in the school." She coughed a little. "He had to be sent home."

       "Why?" You didn't really need to ask - he probably had the images.

       "Mr. Davenport had him brought to the office and his cell phone had the.. banned image. It looked like he was trying to delete it - he had already deleted the e-mail or whatever that'd had it as an attachment. He refused to say who it was from, so.." She had a sad tone in her voice.

       "Oh. My God. They're going to destroy the kid!" Your voice raises. "You turned him over to the police, didn't you!?" You demanded.

       "I had to, Anon.. I.." She sighed.

       "Do you realize what's going to happen to him, now?! He's not even a teenager, yet! His LIFE is OVER, Cheerilee! If he gets a Sex Offender thing on him, he'll never be able to get a job, never be able to go to college.. his rights will be completely stripped from him.. I mean, my God.."

       "How do you think I feel about this!?" She retorted - you can hear tears in her voice - and sniffled. "I didn't have a choice. I.. I have to enforce the rules. You know that."

       "You should never have given up teaching, Cheerilee." You shake your head. "You always said you'd feared having to do things like this."

       "I-I know..." She stammered a little. "..I hoped I could make the Principal's position.. you know.. a little softer on the kids.." She sniffed again.

       "There's no softening it. A kid glove on an iron fist is still an iron fist." You sigh, rather loudly. "It's not your fault. I'll.. have to.. handle this, too, I suppose."

       "I-I'm sorry, Anon." She sighed heavily. "Can.. we meet for coffee, later?"

       "Sure. Starrybuckers, say, five-thirty?" You shrug - the weekend was mostly free, save for grading some tests.

       "Alright. See you there." She sounded a little better.

       That wasn't a flirt, by the way. Not that you thought. You'd known Cheerilee since you started teaching here, and she'd been the one to show you around and get you acclimated to the school. Co-workers, and you'd occasionally meet for coffee outside of the school, or something. One time, you went to a movie with her - but only because you both wanted to see The Dark Knight. It wasn't a date any more than two straight dudes going out to a film together, was.
       Not that you thought, anyway.

       Back to the Model U.N.

       "Kids.. I.. have some horrible news." You start in. "Twist.. get another set of forms for China.." You lean-sit on your desktop. "Rumble is being expelled from the school. He had the banned images on his cell phone. He's.. he's already been handed over to the police." You shrug. "But he refused to say where he got them from.. which.. actually.. is going to make things worse for him."

       Silver Spoon looked ready to cry. Applebloom looked even more humiliated, if such a thing was possible. The kids started jabbering in a somber tone - Rumble was very well liked by the kids. And not because he was China, or Thunder's little bro, but because he was just a really awesome kid.

       "Now.. you have to promise that you won't tell anyone else about this until Monday. We have to have time to properly.. deal with this.. inside the school setting. I have to warn you that.. if you start talking about this.. there could be far worse consequences." You shrug as Twist hands out the papers.

       Understandably, not a lot got done in the Model U.N. that day. Picking a new Russia and China was bad enough, but the kids were too upset to really focus. You tabled everything for another day and dismissed them all. It was better to let them just deal with this, rather than push them to do things they weren't mentally or emotionally focused enough to do.

       On your way to your car, you bump into Quill.

       "Quill." You just give him a nod. No sense starting shit. He wasn't worth it.

       "Short another brat for your Model U.N., were you?" He gives you a smug look.

       "Yes, it seems China has been expelled from school." You ignore him and get to your car. Your cars were parked next to each other.

       "Waste of time, anyway - besides a handful, perhaps, the rest of them are going to spend the rest of their lives in their parents basements, jail, or behind a counter at the Burger Barn." He snorted. "The little criminals.. slackers.. lazy benefits-vampires.."

       "You really don't like kids, do you, Quill?" You cock a brow at him.

       "No, no, I like kids. Good, obedient kids that don't question authority, or break the law, or try to start trouble." He snorted.

       "You like statist bootlickers." You cock a brow at him. "Kids like you, that gleefully throw away everything this country stands for, in the name of control - and power." A mouth-edge twitch. "Your own power."

       "No." He snarled. "I hate kids like YOU that QUESTION everything, that try to PROTEST or COMPLAIN about the government. People NEED to be controlled, Anon. They NEED strong authority. They DON'T need to question what people better and more educated than them, do, as policy decisions." He leaned in real close. "Tight governmental control is the only way anything gets done. Clear, concise rules and strict enforcement. Make examples of the ones that step out of line."

       "Oh, so, voting is just a senseless formality - you'd rather have a Meritocracy, then? Or a Fascist state?" You lean back a little.

       "Whatever form of government that most effectively deals with bums like those kids.. and idiots like you that think giving idiots like THEM any kind of choice has done ANYTHING but RUIN this country." He's snarling at you.

       "Back off, Quill. You're in my space." You hold your hands up, trying to get him to back off from you, a little.

       "See you Monday, Anon." He turned and walked off.

       You'd have to ask Cheerilee if you could have your parking spot moved. Since Quill insisted on being a spoiled brat.



       Coffee with Cheerilee


       You met at Starrybuckers - one of three in this town of 30,000 people - but it was the one that most of the school staff went to, given its prime location along one of the main roads.

       She was there ahead of you, sitting by herself in one of the booths, stirring her coffee to death, and looking out the window, sadly.

       You took a seat across from her, having bought the cheapest swill on the menu at $4 a cup.
       And getting an insulting look from the Barrista as you ordered it plain black, and asked for cream and sugar.
       As though adding common cream and sugar to their overpriced caffeine-water was somehow a grievous sin.

       "Cheerilee." You nodded.

       "His brother was here. You just missed him. He.. he was very upset." She looked at her coffee. "He blamed me."

       "It's not your fault." You shrug. "You just enforce the rules, you don't make them. Besides, Thunder's a good kid. Smart kid. He'll figure out that we're basically powerless in this, sooner or later."

       *Sigh* "I know. Still.." She drank a little and went back to stirring. "..this whole mess, Anon. I wish it would just go away." She shook her head. "How did the kids in the Model U.N. take it?"

       "Hard. Rumble was very well liked by all of them. He was.. he was looking to be just as successful as his brother. I guess that's all gone, now." You shake your head, and scowl. "The trial's going to be horrible. I wonder if they're going to charge him as an adult, like they're saying they're going to do with Diamond?"

       "I don't know. I hope not. If it goes to Family Court, he'll at least be okay once he turns 18, if they don't make him Register for life." She hugs herself with her hands, staring at the coffee. "If they do, though.. God.. he won't survive Prison! He wouldn't even survive Juvie with a charge like that!" She sniffled a little. "I wish there was something I could do. Anything. That poor kid." She sipped the coffee again, out of habit, and hugged herself some more.

       "I guess.. all we can really do.. is be there for the kids that're left." You shrug. "Anyone else get caught?"

       "One.. boy.. was found in one of the boy's room stalls.. uhm.." She coughed a little. "He was.." She made uncomfortable gestures. "..with himself, and looking at his cell phone at the same time. The teacher that caught him.. well, his cell phone went into the toilet, and with the motion sensor flushers.."

       "So, he MIGHT have had the image, and the evidence got destroyed." You shrug. "Alright. Who caught him? Quill?"

       "Mr. Script found him." She shrugged. "God, I want to cry.. this is going to turn into a witch hunt. I know it is. Just like that.. that daycare center thing back in the 1980's.." She sighed heavily. "Anon, do you think I'm cut out for this?"

       "Yeah. You're holding it together. Who'd we get besides you? Quill?" You snort. "He'd have the kids goose-stepping through metal detectors and back-scatter X-Ray scanners before every class." You give a dismissive hand wave. "You're the only one that can ride this out, Cheerilee. You quit now, the School Board probably WILL put him in charge. And he'll do what he can to get me fired and my license revoked. He hates me."

       "I know he does." She rubbed her face. "Thanks, though.. I.. I needed someone to talk to." She was about to get up, but stopped a moment. "Are you busy this weekend? I need to blow off some steam."

       "Nah. Got a class's worth of tests to grade, but that's it. I was going to do that tonight." You finish the swill that calls itself coffee.

       "Cool. Can I come over Saturday? I'll bring my 360 - we'll pown some noobs on Halo or something." She smirked. She was in her late 30's - she basically grew up with video games, and if her office was any indication, tried to keep up as time allowed.

       You, however, suck at Multiplayer. At least, alone.

       "Sure. Three?" You get up to toss your cup.

       "Sounds good." And off she went.



       Saturday - Gaming with Cheerilee


       Really, this isn't much of an event. The two of you indeed spend the afternoon playing Multiplayer on whatever games you can get your hands on. Halo, Call of Duty, anything. She even plays a few rounds of Left 4 Dead with just you.

       Really, you're just good friends.

       You split the bill on Burger Barn for dinner, and sat and talked about how this whole incident was going to explode in everyone's faces in ways that no one can predict. You both express displeasure for the way Quill was handling all this, and were both fairly certain that he'd push for random locker inspections and stuff.

       "Oh, man.." You shake your head, having retold the tale of your confrontation in the parking lot. "..he looked ready to blow a head gasket!"

       *Ha-ha!* "I bet he did.." She got up from the floor. It was late.. time for her to get home.. "..Anon?"

       "Yeah?" You said, escorting her to the door.

       She gave you a peck on the cheek. "Thank you." And a blushing smile.

       "For what?" Your cheeks went a bit red, too.

       "Being there for me. When I need a really good friend." A half-hug, and she'd depart.

       That was the first time she kissed you.

       Really, you were just good friends..

       ..no, seriously..

       ..why did you start thinking about her, though? Not like THAT, but.. like.. wondering what kind of an emotional load she's shouldering and if you can help her somehow.. do SOMETHING for her..
       Being such a good friend, you can't let her bear all this alone. Your mind swirls with thoughts of how to get this whole mess to become a non-issue as soon as possible.. all through the night and well into the next day, as you took some time to outline things for the next Model U.N. meeting.
       Anything to get your mind off of what's happened..

       Then, you get the call..

       "Anon.." It was Cheerilee. "..there's.." *Sniffle* "..come over to my place, PLEASE.. there's been.. an incident.."

       She wouldn't talk over the phone, so, you practically flew over to her house. When you arrived, she was on the front stoop, in a skirt-suit like she wore for school, and on the phone with someone. She was also fighting her hardest not to break down and cry over the phone.

       "Cheerilee!" You say, almost forgetting to turn off your car as you get out and move over to her. "What's happened!?"

       "Just.. just a second.." She put her hand over the phone, and looked up to you. "..Rumble.. Rumble hung himself!" She lost it. Completely lost it. Sobbing her eyes out. "HE'S DEAD!" She shrieked.

       You took the phone and looked at the number - Principal Celestia from the High School.

       "Miss Celestia, Miss Cheerilee will call you back." You say, sticking the phone to your ear as you hug Cheerilee, and rub her back with your other hand.

       "Who is this..?" She asks, also sounding very upset.

       "Anon Y Mous, I'm a Social Studies teacher at the Junior High - Rumble was part of my Model U.N. Club." Cheerilee was still sobbing into your shoulder.

       "Ah.. well.. alright. Just so you know, there's an emergency PTA meeting tomorrow night, and school's been cancelled for Monday." She sniffled a little.

       "Alright." You hang up. "Cheerilee, what're you dressed up for?" You address her, pulling her away from your shoulder.

       "To go to the Lane's house.." She sniffled. "..I want to.. I want to be there for them.." She sobbed again. "I feel like this is all my fault!!"

       "I told you before.. it's not your fault." You hug her and know now why she asked you over - she couldn't drive like this. So, you'd get her in your car.. and head over to the Lane's..

       You get there, and the cops are still there. The ambulance, you passed, on your way in to their subdivision. There's a couple unmarked cars here.. they're both in the driveway, but both of them have their lights off. You know they're police or something, simply because of how they look. Actually, the one you can see the clearest seems to have Federal Government license plates.

       Odd.

       "Cheerilee.. can you settle down for me?" You turn to her, in the car, and rub her shoulders.

       "I-I think so.." She sniffles some.. hiccups.. and gathers herself, looking in your vanity mirror to try and make herself look presentable.

       The two of you get out of the car and - unchallenged by the police - get to the front door.

       "Mr. Lane?!" You call into the house. Frost Lane was a local hero of some regard - High School football champion, Gulf War 1 veteran, did some Cowboy stuff for a couple years, owned a sporting goods store in town. "Mr. Lane! It's Principal Cheerilee and Mr. Mous! Can we come i-"

       Thunder met you at the door.

       "Thunder.." You just hug him out of instinct. "..I'm so.. I'm so sorry.."

       Surprisingly, he hugs you back. "Mr. Mous! OH.. GAWD.. MY LIL' BROTHER!" *LOUD sobbing*

       "Thunder..!" Cheerilee sniffles at the sight of him, bends down a bit, and hugs him as well.

       Two men in suits come around the corner, hearing all this. You can see the FBI badges on their hips. Thunder stops, and turns to them..

       "MURDERERS! MURDERERS! YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES MURDERED MY LITTLE BROTHER!" He screams at the top of his lungs. You have to hold him back when he tries lunging for them.

       The taller agent looks at you, and looks at Cheerilee. "And who are you two?"

       "Anon Y Mous and Principal Cheerilee." You give him a bit of a glare. "What's going on, here?"

       "That young man there is being questioned in connection with a federal investigation into the distribution of child pornography!" The shorter agent bellowed. "Turn him loose, we're not done with him, yet!"

       "I turn him loose, you're going to be forced to shoot him-" You start.

       "YOU ASSHOLES! YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! I'M NOT ANSWERING ANYTHING ELSE! FUCK YOU ALL TO HELL!" He screams, still trying to break free.

       "-see?!" You frustratingly look at them. "Now, what're your names? And I want your federal ID numbers, too." You give them a hard look.

       *Sigh* "Fine. Here." The taller one pulls out a business card, as does the shorter one.

       "Cheerilee?" You nod to them.

       She goes over and fetches the cards. "Agents Wilcox and Howard." She nods to the tall one, then the short one, in turn.

       The short one DOES look a little like a young Ron Howard, from Happy Days.

       "Right now, he's part of an investigation-" Agent Howard started.

       "YOU LEAVE MAH OTHER BOY ALONE!" Came the bellowing of Frost Lane from the side room.
       Frost staggers out, almost unable to walk with the grief and pain. He looks at you, then Cheerilee, and to his son.
       "Mizz Cheerilee.. git my son outta here 'fore these Feds kill him, too." He bitterly spits.

       "May I remind you that we have a warrant, now, Mister Lane-" Agent Howard again.

       "IT AIN'T TO ARREST MAH OTHER BOY!" Frost, again, cutting him off.

       "He won't be fleeing the jurisdiction, Opie." You give the agent a taunting smirk.

       Agent Howard narrows his eyes fiercely at you. You've struck a nerve.

       "Ron." The other agent starts, putting a hand on his shoulder. "Let it go."

       "You heard him, Richie. Let it go." You - with your arms still holding Thunder back - pull him out the door. "Say Bye-Bye to Huck Finn, Thunder."

       Agent Howard's eyes gleamed with rage at your taunting.

       "Go to hell. Both of you." Thunder spat at them as you got him out the door.

       Time for a little junk food therapy. You two took him to Burger Barn, told him to order whatever he wanted, and sat off in the corner with him.

       "Can you tell us how it happened, Thunder?" You ask, sitting down with your order. You paid - just easier that way.

       "Well.. they showed up about eleven o'clock.. they had a warrant to search Rumble's things. Take his phone, his computer, all of it. But first, they wanted.." *Sniff* "..they said they just wanted to talk to him! Dad and mom had to be there. Then they started in on him! They-they.. they talked to him like he was some kinda scumbag! Saying stuff like 'You ever f-f-.." *Sniffles* *Hard swallow.* "'..fucked her? You taking nudes of other little girls?' Stuff like that. Th-they told him he'd get it worse unless he told them who the pictures came from.."

       "Oh, Thunder.." Cheerilee rubbed his arm. "..I'm so sorry."

       "Yeah.. well.. then they started saying.. he could be tried as an adult.. sent to a real prison.. and there wasn't anything Dad could do for him. And they said.. they said.. 'You know what happens to child molesters in prison, right?' I think that.. I think that's what did it." He hugged his arms. "He excused himself to the bathroom.." *Sob* "..he didn't come out. When he'd been up there about ten minutes, Dad went to check on him.." *Sobbing harder* "..he was already dead! He took his belt off and hung himself from the s-sh-shower pipe!"
       Thunder broke down and sobbed. Hard. Probably not the first time in the last couple of hours.
       Despite the high emotions, you made yourself eat. Simply because you knew you'd be skipping dinner. Cheerilee cried-and-ate.. how females can do that, you don't quite know, but she did. Emotional eating? Eh, maybe.. she HAD put on a few pounds since becoming Principal.
       Thunder stopped crying after a bit, and started wolfing down food like he hadn't eaten all day. Growing teenager? High emotions? No surprise.

       "Thunder.. WAS Rumble protecting anyone?" You had to ask. You wouldn't tell those two dipsticks, anyway. Let THEM find it out for themselves.

       "N-No.. I don't think so. He didn't say anything to me." He shrugged, and lopped off half of a double quarter pound burger in one big bite.

       "Was Rumble having problems with any of the other students?" Cheerilee asked, between wolfing down french fries. Yeah, she probably WAS an emotional eater.. it explained a lot.

       "He said.. he said a girl was bothering him." Thunder looked up from his Oreo Blizzy.

       "Diamond Tiara?" You ask, a brow cocked.

       "Yeah, yeah, that's her name. He said she.. well, she didn't beat him up, but she got someone else to do it. She stood there and watched, though. He said she hit him a few times before, too." He started wolfing down the sweet, cold treat.

       "I.. I never knew.." Cheerilee was stunned. "He never approached me."

       "I didn't know, either.." You finished up your french fries.

       "Rumble told me he didn't think anything would happen, but making it worse. She's.. well, she's a girl, and all..." He shrugged, and practically slumped over what was left of his food, in renewed tears. "I should've done SOMETHING! I was his big brother! I-I.. I should.." *Darkly* "..I should be the one dead, not him."

       Survivor's Guilt. There it was.

       "Don't ever think that, Thunder." You grab his shoulder, and half-hug him. "Don't ever.. EVER think that." He needed counseling. Lots of it. "This isn't your fault. There was nothing more you could have done. You KNOW what it's like to be Monday Morning Quarterback'ed. Don't do it to yourself, too."

       He sobbed into your shoulder for a while longer.



       Monday Evening. The PTA Meeting.


       You attended, only because you KNEW Quill was going to be there.
       Troubling indeed, both Agent Wilcox and Agent Howard were there, as well.
       Cheerilee was beside herself, but she attended anyway.
       In an unusual move, Principal Celestia and Vice Principal Luna from Canterlot High also attended.
       Not surprisingly, Superintendent Sombra was also there.
       It seems that at least one student from the High School was suspected of having the images as well, though no proof was available because, somehow, the phone got broken in the attempt by the teacher - Mr. Turner - to get it away from the student.
       As in, the kid smashed his phone on the ground and stomped on the SIM chip hard enough to break it.
       It was sent to the police as evidence, just in case.
       As you expected, you were basically one of very few sane voices in the room.

       "We need to do SOMETHING!" One of the parents stood up and shouted. "We have to protect our children from this.. this.. PORNOGRAPHY!"
       "She's right!" Chimes in another parent. "My sweet little girl would never DREAM of doing something like this!"
       "What kind of home was that little girl in, that she thought it was okay to FLAUNT her BODY like that!?"
       "At least the little pervert that had those pictures had the good sense to kill himself instead of shooting up the school!" Another parent harpies out into the crowd.

       You never hated humanity more than you did at this moment.

       *AHEM* Superintendent Sombra, at the microphone. "Everyone, please settle down, so we can start the meeting and discuss this situation."
       The talking goes down to a low murmur.
       "With us - by request - are the two federal agents in charge of the investigation - Donald Wilcox and Ron Howard." He gestures towards them.
       "OPIIEEE!" You threw your voice towards the left a bit.. enough to mask its origin. Just to rattle the fucker's cage.
       "WHO SAID THAT!?" Agent Howard stood up, angrily.

       No one owned up.. so, Superintendent Sombra pressed on, ignoring the outburst, as Agent Wilcox dragged his partner into his seat.
       "Now, everyone here is aware of the situation, but I don't know if everyone has the actual facts." He cleared his throat a little. "The facts are this. First, last Wednesday, pictures surfaced on the internet depicting one of the district's students, naked. This student attends the junior high school. Second, after being contacted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Canterlot Police were handed a warrant for the arrest of the one suspected of taking the photos - another student at the junior high. Third, on Thursday Evening, that student was arrested. Fourth, that student was given an immediate bail hearing, and given that student's age, was granted bail. Fifth, the federal prosecutor assigned to the case has assured me that they will be seeking the maximum penalty if the student is convicted of all charges - the prosecutor has said they want to make an example of this student's behavior, so other kids know that doing things like this is AGAINST the LAW." He made this part very clear. "Sixth.. on Friday, a student that was caught with at least one illegal image on their cell phone. Seventh. On Sunday, that student committed suicide." He brushed off his suit a little, and fixed his tie. "Those are the facts of the case. Now, of course, as concerned parents, teachers, and district staff, I'm sure we all want to figure out the best way to prevent some great tragedy like this from ever happening again." He held his hands up in a placating gesture. "While I do have sole authority to enact new district rules - and new rules were, in fact, put in place starting on Friday - I want to hear the opinions of the people closest to this horrible incident."
       Typical political bullshit. He was passing the buck to the parents, and making them select the weight of the shackles to place on their kids's wrists and ankles.

       Superintendent Sombra nodded to Principal Celestia and Principal Cheerilee. "We have with us the principals of both the High School and Junior High." Then a nod to Dr. Zecora. "And Dr. Zecora - the district's mental health consultant." He continued, looking to the crowd with confidence. "Let's keep this orderly, shall we? We'll start by hearing from some of the teachers. Mr. Davenport of the Junior High has expressed great interest in speaking this evening." He gestures for Quill to come up to the stage. "Mr. Davenport?"
       Fucker. Figures he'd go right to the Supe about his nasty plans. He gets up there, and there's a little polite applause.

       "Thank you, thank you." He graciously makes placating gestures with his hands. "I've been an educator for twelve years, now. And I've seen the way that the winds of change are blowing - children sexualized on television, the internet in some barely legal dancing videos, in beauty pageants, and more. And I'm sure this degenerate programming has had SOME influence on this reprehensible behavior." He takes a calculated drink of water, to gauge audience response. It seems positive, so he continues. "As parents and educators, it's our job to make sure the students we take care of, grow up to be responsible, obedient, tax-paying citizens." He slipped the "o" word in there. "To do that, they need rules and structure, of course. But, as times change, the rules have to change. When they first became widely available, the school district had a strict No Pagers, No Cell Phones policy. As time went on, and their value as an emergency contact method became clear, this rule was changed. Cell phones also changed - they now have full internet access, even without tapping into a local server. They have cameras, too, which was the device that started all of this." He made a gesture.

       "In order to combat incidents like this, I think it's time to re-evaluate our policies regarding cellular devices and the access to the internet that we permit our students." He gives a shrug. "Of course, the district doesn't have the funds to shield every school building and sports field in an internet-blocking dome. But what we can do is limit the privileges of the students - and the and capability of their devices - in such a way as to curtail the possibility of things like this happening ever again. That and additional authority on behalf of staff members to seize these devices and any other hazards that could disrupt class or otherwise imperil the moral fiber of the school and its students." He shrugs a little, again. "To that end, I propose the following changes to district policy..
       1) Cell phones may not have cameras. If they have cameras on them, they must be placed in the care of the school's office during class time. Additionally, they should not have the capability of accepting media files.
       2) Teachers should have the authority to seize any device from any student at any time, if it's causing any kind of a disruption. Current rules only allow teachers to seize noisy things - cell phones can be ordered to be powered down during class time, but they cannot be taken from the student. I understand this is due to the cash value of the device, and the District's desire to avoid responsibility for their damage or loss.
       3) Student lockers should be accessible to any staff member at any time, if that staff member has any reason to believe that the student has some form of contraband.
       4) Teachers should also have the authority to go through student's belongings if they're caught with contraband - on the spot, and immediately, instead of waiting for them to be brought to the principal.
       5) The permanent assignment of a School Resource Police Officer to all three city schools.
       6) To prevent violence, the installation of metal detectors should be considered, at least at the High School. If a student can commit suicide in their own home, under the noses of two professional, highly-trained, federal agents, it should be clear that there's an even greater threat to the students in the school buildings themselves.
       7) Further restriction of Student's online access - preventing them from having publicly visible profiles on any websites that are not for family or educational purposes, and punishing or counseling students that post on more extreme, unacceptable places, and reveal their identity, or the identity of any other person in the school system."
       "Our greatest enemy.." Davenport continues. "..is the illusion of privacy and the idea that students have some certain 'rights' (he enunciated this as though it was an alien word) when they attend school. This leads to dangerous ideas.. and apparently, trusting the students with all these privileges has led to disaster. We must reinforce the notion that the students are there to LEARN in a SAFE and CONTROLLED environment - removing any and all possible distractions, and securing the buildings properly, will help us all assure this. After all, Students can't be posing for racy images if they've no way of recording them, yes? Yes. And I think the affirmation of the new policies as permanent should be done as well - Zero Tolerance for any naughty behavior, followed by swift punishment for offenders. Reinforce the point that flaunting the rules and disregarding authority will be met by swift punishment."
       That's what he was after, anyway - drill it into the kids' heads not to question anything, follow the rules like drones.. drain away any sense of individuality or idea of personal responsibility. Quill Davenport received heavy applause for his concise, well-thought-out proposal - he looked like he was doing something to combat this perceived evil, and sounding the appropriate warning against dangers, real or imagined. He stepped down, with Superintendent Somra's sincere thanks.

       Soulless statist cocksucker gets handshake and public thanks from a dyed-in-the-wool Politician, in every conceivable insulting definition of that word.

       You stand up as the applause dies down. You have to say something.. no one else in this room is really worried about the kids themselves, they're only worried about the things their precious pooplings are exposed to, and how these so-called 'threats' are a threat or danger to them.

       Not one of them cares about what the kids are going to think. Or how this will affect them.

       No one but you.

       "Mr. Mous?" Superintendent Sombra seems surprised to see you stand up.

       "I'd like to speak, sir." You look at Agent Howard, though.

       He KNOWS who shouted "Opie" now, and he's SNARLING.

       "Of course, Anon." He gestures to the podium.

       You go up there - you weren't wearing a full suit, just a nice, collared shirt and jeans. Casual, compared to the rest of the staff. Downright trashy compared to Quill. You hoped this "softer" look would help in getting the parents to think of you as being on their level, not above them.

       *Ahem*Microphone feedback*

       You adjust the thing a little.

       "Mr. Davenport and I have been colleagues for the last seven years." You nod to him. "I'll be the first to admit that we don't get along. At all. But I do respect his experience and the breadth and depth of his mastery of his preferred areas of study. He's a smart man. And I do agree with him that something needs to be done about the situation."

       Quill looks ready to have a heart attack. You AGREE with him? You show RESPECT for him?

       All part of the plan..

       "But I completely disagree with his suggestions." Murmurs from the crowd. "If we clamp down even tighter on these kids, if we treat them like they're always suspected of SOMETHING, then we alienate them. We send them the message that Teachers can't be trusted. Adults can't be trusted. And as they get older, and become adults, they'll start to distrust people around them. If we teach them not to question authority, not to fight perceived injustices, we teach them to be door mats - not critical thinkers. We teach them that there are two classes in society - them and the ruling elite, those with authority over them. We teach them not to trust the very people they're taught to trust, but to entrust everything to those more powerful than them, rather than teaching them that they themselves have power, and can be a force for change." The crowd seems.. confused. Of course, this doesn't have much to do with the situation itself - you're refuting Quill's arguments and suggestions.

       "Instead of.. trying to control them.. or trying to force them to obey, we should build rapport with them - get them to come to us when there's a problem. Let them feel as though they CAN trust us. The student that killed himself? He was being bullied by the student that's suspected of the initial crime."

       That got some people's attentions..

       Actually, most directly, Agent Howard and Agent Wilcox lean back and chat among themselves for a moment.

       "Instead of these new rules, granting even more power to the staff and having police on the grounds of the school during school hours, perhaps we should have a rule like.. an open door policy. If your kid is having a problem, wouldn't you want them to tell someone? They won't automatically come to Mommy or Daddy or Grandpa or Grandma at this age - no, they'll go to their friends, their brothers or sisters.. people that they think they can trust. They often believe parents will do more harm than good. And that Teachers won't keep their confessions safe. If we're going to make any headway into making things safer, we need to start by communicating with them on their level." You gesture to Dr. Zecora. "I'm sure Dr. Zecora will back me up on this when I say that talking and communicating is the first step towards solving a problem, no matter what it is. So, I'd rather some new policy allow Teachers to decide for themselves - if a student approaches them with a problem - how to handle it. If it's minor, and wholly within the bounds of the classroom, the Teacher should be able to handle it themselves. If the student just wants to talk, the Teachers should not be forced to rat on them to the principal or other authorities at even the slightest hint of something wrong. Instead of enforced and demanded reporting, voluntary reporting, and only if the Teacher thinks there's an imminent threat of bodily harm. And, yes, if weapons are involved, it's time to get the police.. but, think about it, how many times have weapons been brought to our schools - WITH malicious intent - in the last seven to twelve years? I can think of one instance, and that was only to slash someone's tires." You pace a little.

       "We need to talk to the kids, not order them around. Give them some trust and responsibility, instead of the ambiguity of the current rules. The kids in Junior High and High School should be treated like young adults that are innocent until proven guilty, not little thugs that are possibly guilty of something until proven innocent." A slight shrug to the crowd. "When you were their age.. who did you want to talk to? YOUR folks, who you saw as out-of-touch and only there to make a situation more humiliating? Or a Teacher that you liked and trusted?" A nod to them all. "Think about that before you think about putting your kids in what'll amount to a prison facility."

       You bowed slightly, and were about to step off the stage, when Agent Wilcox intercepted you and directed you out of the auditorium.

       Out in the hall, he's there, alone. Agent Howard was still on the stage at the table.

       "Do you know something, Mr. Mous?" He cocks a brow at you.

       "I know your partner is hypersensitive to any reference to the Hollywood Personality that shares his name." You shrug.

       "I mean about the bullying. No one ever mentioned that to us." He gestures.

       "Then maybe you ought to spend a little more time LISTENING to these kids, instead of THREATENING them." You point harshly towards his chest, making stabbing motions with your index finger, but not touching him.

       *Sigh* "Do you know anything, Mr. Mous?" Hands on hips.

       "Not anything admissible in court, only hearsay. Thunder, the kid's brother, mentioned that he thought Rumble was being bullied by Diamond. Hard core. Like, beatings and hittings. And he didn't say anything to the authorities in the school because he was convinced it would only make the situation worse." Shrug, with hands thrown up, you look him over. "He also felt trapped because Diamond Tiara is a girl, and he's a boy, and thus, he couldn't fight back. Because he feared he would automatically be seen as the one in the wrong."

       "Is that it?" He took some short notes.

       "That's all I know. Talk to Thunder.. and try talking to him as a buddy, not throwing around threats." A head-shake from you.

       "Mmm." He gives you a bit of a sour look. "You don't like authority, do you, Mr. Mous?"

       "People like you, with all sorts of power and legal trickery at their hands, who can lock up anyone at any time just by shouting Terrorist, are the very sorts of people my ideals stand against." You narrow your eyes at him. That statement.. "No, Agent Wilcox, I don't like your particular stripe of authority. But I am bound to obey it. Some form of authority is necessary. Until it's abused. And if you give a human being authority, they'll abuse it sooner or later, one way or another." A side-of-the-head nod to him. "If it brings this situation to an end any sooner, I will help with the case if I see laws broken with malicious intent. But don't expect me to shovel MY kids at you if I don't think they've done anything intentionally wrong."

       "You're not a court system, Mr. Mous." He admonishes you.

       "No, I'm not. I'm a Teacher. I have to spend ten hours, some days, around kids. I have to see them through their victories and defeats. I may not be a court system, but I've learned how to judge right from wrong - maliciousness from innocent mistakes. The problem with these young adults is that they're NOT adults, yet - they think they are, but they're not. They need guidance, still, but they also need a free hand to be allowed to make mistakes and not have their lives ruined because of it. Zero tolerance leads to horrible punishments on those that do not intend to be in the wrong." You shrug a little. "Done building my NSA profile, yet?"

       "Hah. Very funny. No, no, I'm not building an NSA profile on you, Anon Y Mous." He shook his head and put his notepad away. "We don't talk to the NSA." A shrug, and he went back towards the stage.

       The fallout from the PTA meeting was mixed at best. Quill got his wish when it came to a slightly looser hand in dealing with students, but he didn't get everything he wanted. The elementary school would be Police and Metal Detector free. The high school would have both, and the Junior High would get a single Resource Officer.

       As for the cell phone thing, a middle-of-the-road policy was adopted - students must now have their phones turned off inside class rooms unless the teachers specifically allow them to be on, such as a student doing something quiet after a test. The camera thing was viewed through the lens of property liability and the fact that not all students could afford new phones - any future classes would be restricted to non-camera cell phones, but the current ones would be allowed to keep them.

       Additionally, the restriction on photo sharing was loosened. Sanctioned after school activities could be photographed and posted online, as long as the teacher or staff in charge of that activity expressly permitted it.

       Still, the staff of the school would retain the authority to snoop the kid's social media sites, would have expanded search powers, and would have the ability to take away any object that was -actively- causing a disruption, but all of these confiscated items had to be done with a receipt, and the items given to The Office at each school at the end of every school day. Students would be allowed to get them back, then.

       You got your Open Door Rule, though. Teachers now had the authority to talk to students privately, and exercise their own judgement about the information given to them. You knew Free Market economics - in this case, the resource and currency being information and trust - would gravitate students away from Teachers like Quill Davenport, and towards you and Cheerilee.

       The days dragged by like a body over broken glass. Every now and then, though, a student would be suspected, accused, or even caught with Applebloom's nudes on their phones, computers, or posted to social media.

       You didn't understand it - some of these kids were really good kids. They'd never do anything like this.

       No new announcements from the police or the Feds did make things easier, though - them shutting up about this instead of it constantly being in everyone's faces, made things more bearable. It also helped people forget.

       Rumble's funeral.. that was hard. You went, even though you knew you'd cry.

       Most of the Model U.N. Club showed up.. including Applebloom's older sister and brother.

       You remembered Applejack, but you'd never had her or Mac in your classes. Mac was a senior, Applejack was a Sophomore.

       Still, you took the opportunity to go talk to them.

       "Applejack, right?" You approached her as the service was breaking up. "Hello, Applebloom.."

       "H'lo, Mr. Mous.." Applebloom said, dejectedly.
       "Yeah, a'hm, Applejack." She nodded. "Ah r'member you from Junior High.." She had Applebloom in front of her. Mac was behind them.

       "I know this is odd to ask.. but.. do you know anything about Rumble's personal life?" You shrug.

       Applejack suddenly looked serious. "Mac, take Applebloom to th' car." She gently pushed Applebloom away. "Go on, now, lil' sis."

       "Buht Applejayck!" She protested.

       "GO! Dangit!" She looked ready to order Mac to carry her.

       "Awright.." She trodded off, still depressed.

       "Why'd you send her away?" You quizzed.

       "'Cuz she don't need to know Rumble had one powerful crush on 'er." She crossed her arms. "He told me.. thought I could help 'im.. you know.. teach 'im what girls like 'n stuff." Her mouth twitched. "Ah also know Tiara had an equally powerful crush right back'on Rumble! She wuz greener'n a gator over how Rumble treated Applebloom." And shook her head.

       A thought comes to mind. A very horrible one, but a thought none the less.

       "Would you put it past Diamond Tiara to plant those pictures she took of Applebloom on Rumble's phone, if she had the power to do so?"

       "T'wouldn't shock me one DANG bit.. that girl's just made'a evil. Devil's child, if't ever I saw'd one." She wiped her face. "Anythin' to git at Applebloom."

       "A-huh.." You scratch your chin.. things were starting to come together. "Thank you, Applejack."

       You explained this to Cheerilee. All of it. While the two of you sat in the ice cream shop, after the funeral, having one of their grilled burgers.

       "I think Diamond Tiara is behind this, somehow." You started. "I think she has a way of sending either a virus or just a bad E-Mail attachment to people's phones that causes the banned image to be downloaded or something. Think about it - almost all the people caught with the image were boys. Only a few girls. What do you want to bet that if we cross-reference anyone Diamond Tiara had a massive hate-boner for, with the students that've been recently kicked out and arrested.. we'll find a link?" You asked that, and dug in to the big-ass burger - this place was better than Burger Barn any day of the week. You'd probably come here from now on, screw the chain restaurant for anything but their Chicken Fries.

       "You know what...!?" She perked up. "That makes sense! But the police confiscated all her electronics.." She shrugged. "Of course, her folks are loaded, and they have servants and things. Even if she's basically under house arrest, it wouldn't be that hard for her to get a cell phone, or something.."

       "Exactly my line of thought." You nod.

       "So, what do we do about it?" She shrugged.

       "Bring it up to the Feds." A dismissive hand wave. "We're not Scooby Doo, and this ain't the Mystery Machine.. but this is a really good burger." You continue to wolf it down.

       "Alright.. where are they, do you think?" She was spooning at her milkshake - there was a big block of ice cream in it, and she was trying to break it down, some, so she could suck it out with the straw.

       "We can call them - I still have their cards." A small smirk from you. "Kinda funny, though.. you know how I feel about people like that. And here I am, helping them."

       "You're going to clear Rumble's name, is what you're going to do, Anon." She smiled. "Thank you."

       "What for?" You lean back, with a part of a pickle dangling from your lips.

       "Being awesome." She plucked the pickle off, and ate it.

       "Well, let's see if I'm right, first.."

       And so, it came to be, that Anon Y Mous called the Feds. You decide on Agent Wilcox - he seems the saner of the two.

       "Well, I can't really do much without some supporting evidence, you understand." He explains to you. "She may be on Bail, but I can't randomly toss her estate and harass her father's employees."

       "I understand. Laws are laws." And you didn't condone stepping over the line on them, even if it was in your own best interests.

       "If you get anything solid that I can use in court, then.. yeah, sure. I'll get a warrant to search the place again, and this time, cover the help and her parents' things."

       "Okay. Okay.. I might just have an angle on that.. thank you, Agent Wilcox." A smirk.

       "Maybe you're not so bad after all, Anon.." A chuckle in his voice.

       "No, I am. I really don't like you guys, but you're necessary in order to catch and punish criminals. No two ways about it." But the OTHER stuff they do? Yeah. Anon does not cotton to abusive authority.

       The next school day was Friday, again. It was now exactly two weeks since this all started. Diamond Tiara's expulsion hearing was Saturday at 9AM. Her first court date for preliminaries and jury selection wasn't for another two months. Rumor got back to you that she had, get this, a private tutor.

       That means, of course, Daddy doesn't think his little girl is going to be convicted of a damn thing. He has confidence that she either did nothing wrong, or he can beat the charges against her.

       That also means that, some way, somehow, he was condoning his daughter's actions.

       Silver Spoon, on the other hand? Diamond Tiara's dedicated sidekick? She had not fared well without Diamond's power and influence to back her up. Their bullying empire crumbled around her, and she could barely go a day without getting harassed by the kids she once bullied around.

       Actually, the only ones that weren't giving her a hard time, was Applebloom, Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle.

       Strange, that. Shouldn't Silver Spoon be just as guilty as Diamond Tiara? Didn't they do this together, like they always did?

       The behavior of all parties involved led you to suspect there was something more going on here than you first thought. Your first step was finding out exactly what happened, and finding out from Applebloom how it all started.

       For that matter, you didn't even -exactly- know how the FBI caught Diamond Tiara in the first place.. maybe Silver Spoon knew..

       So, you asked them both to stay after school that Friday. You were going to get to the bottom of this. Especially since yet another student was caught in the web of this porn thing today, and summarily suspended until they could be processed by the law.

       They both agreed.. and strangely, Silver Spoon seemed eager to do it.

       Cheerilee agreed to help. When the girls arrived, she took Applebloom aside into your office, and started talking to her. You, meanwhile, got Silver Spoon..

       "Silver.. I want to know-" You start..

       "This was all her!" She blurts out. "Please, Mr. Mous! You gotta believe me!" She almost immediately breaks down in tears. Not crocodile tears, REAL tears.

       "Silver, were you.. did you want to come to me about this?" You lean back in your chair.

       "I was afraid Diamond would.. she'd.. get me, too.." She sniffled. "I'm so sorry! I couldn't STOP her.." She threw off her glasses, letting them dangle by the strap around her neck, and sobbed hard into her hands.

       "Start at the beginning, Silver. Please." You put a hand on her shoulder. "I need to know. There've been fourteen kids caught up in this."

       She sobbed a bit longer, but finally gathered herself enough to talk. "The day it all happened, I was busy with my folks.. they wanted another car, but they dragged me along with. Tiara was.. she told me she had the ultimate plan to completely humiliate Applebloom for the rest of her life and get her labelled a slut." She shrugged, helplessly. "She told me later, what she did. That she went over to Applebloom's house.. made all friendly like she was trying to make amends for her actions.. and.. then she got Applebloom to.. she said she got her to strip by offering her some of her clothes she didn't wear any more. You know.. top label stuff.. stuff Applebloom would NEVER be able to afford! Then.. she.. when she got her naked.. she took that first photo. That's the one everyone's getting caught with, mainly.." She sniffled a little, and continued. "..then, she.. she did things to her. Horrible things. She.." Silver blinked. "Can a girl rape another girl?"

       You went absolutely pale. Just what the hell kind of investigation was Wilcox and Howard running, that they missed this!?

       "Yes.. Silver.. it's possible.." You nod to her. "Continue."

       "Funny.. that's not what Diamond said.. but.. I trust you, Mr. Mous.." She said, and went into the gory details.

       Silver explained to you that Diamond got Applebloom all tied up, and did "things" to her. And filmed part of it. And took pictures. When it was all done, though, her first instinct was to show this to her lackey - Silver - and gloat about it..

       "She.. just laughed. I told her.. I told her it went too far! She didn't listen!" She huffed and was ready to cry again. "I tried to get her to stop.. but then she.. she put the pictures up on this one.. this one website.." She suddenly curled up in a ball, holding her knees to her chest. "Tia's been.. taking pictures of herself for that place."

       "That must be how the Feds found her. They were probably watching her, to see if she'd upload anything else besides herself - her going and uploading that stuff about Applebloom? That gave them another 'victim' besides some exhibitionist pervy kid. The perfect evidence." You nod. "Did she upload any of the explicit stuff? You know, with the 'special things'?"

       "No, just nude pictures. Along with her name and address." She frowned. "She wanted me to take pictures with her, too, but.. I said no.. mainly.. you know.. my parents are very conservative, they'd NEVER tolerate me making a hussy of myself!"

       She was probably told that, verbatim, fairly recently, and was merely parroting it.

       "What about Rumble? Did she know Rumble had a crush on Applebloom?" That was the lynchpin.

       "Yeah. She.. she said she was going to show Rumble just what a girl's really for. I know it sounds crazy, but.. she SENT him those pictures! And probably the video, too!" She threw her hands out, exasperated.

       "Now the big question. Do you have any proof?" You cross your arms.

       "Yeah. She's been texting me every day.. mainly threats, though.. like.. if I tell anyone, she'll upload all that stuff to my computer and things, then make Applebloom say I.. I was the one that did things to her, while Tia just took pictures." She sniffled, and hugged her knees a little tighter. "But she did tell me.. like.. she sent pictures to different boys we didn't.. she didn't.. like. And she told.." She wiped away tears. "..she said if I didn't tell Mr. Davenport, she'd.. she'd get me, too. She knows all my account names, passwords, everything!"

       "Of course she'd pick Mr. Davenport. He's got a tree trunk so far up.." You cut yourself short of disrespecting another Teacher in front of a Student. You may not like him - at ALL - but your insults to him were between you two. "..he's very strict."

       "Anyway.." She rubbed her face. "..I got the proof on my phone. She even.. she even showed me where all the stuff was hidden, in some Cloud Storage space."

       She pulled out her phone and turned it on, then went back through her text messages over the last two weeks. Sure enough, Tiara's confession was spelled out right here. Along with her 'new' phone number, her 'new' instant messaging accounts, everything.. it was all the evidence you could ever want. The link to the Cloud Storage space was even legit - just to be sure, you accessed it for a quick peek, to ensure the evidence was there, and Tiara wasn't just setting up Silver Spoon to take a fall. Three video segments totaling 2 hours of video, 158 photos, and two sound clips of about two minutes each. You recognized the file name of one of the photos, accessed it, and sure enough - it was the primary photo that ALL the recently-caught students had been caught with.

       "Silver, would you testify to this in court?" You put a hand on her shoulder. "I promise you, you won't get in trouble. You were acting under threat. You had no way to escape what she was threatening to do to you. I'm sure the prosecutor will give you immunity."

       "I would! I would! I feel so horrible.. I know.. I mean, I just KNOW she's been torturing Applebloom this whole time!" She sniffled and wiped her face. "I.. you know.. she may be poor and all.. but.. but.." She went back to tightly hugging herself. "..when I saw what Tia did, I just.. I felt so dirty. Like.. no one deserves that."

       "No one does. And you've learned that." You pat her shoulder and stand up. "Stay here, I want to see how Miss Cheerilee is doing with Applebloom."

       "Can you.. tell her.. I'm sorry?" She stared at the floor.

       "Of course, I will." You take a step from your desk.. only to hear footsteps running away from your door! "What the-" And you run over to check, only to see the door to the stairs flap closed, just as you reach the doorway. "Shit.. CHEERILEE!" You yell - your office is partly soundproof.

       "What is it!?" She yells out, having taken a second to get out of your office and to the main classroom.

       "Call the Feds! Call them NOW! Tell Wilcox I have PROOF that Diamond Tiara was doing EVERYTHING!" You hand her Silver's cell phone. "And that she raped Applebloom. And tell him to get the cops to Diamond Tiara's place on the double!"

       "Why!?" She took the phone and pulled her own out, along with Wilcox's card.

       "I think that was Thunder.. I think he's going to go avenge his little brother.." You head out the door. "Wait for the cops!" And give chase.

       Problem Number 1. By the time you get to the parking lot, you can hear a motorcycle flying away at full speed - it's already out of visual range.
       Problem Number 2. It's a motorcycle - it can go where it wants. You're in a car - you're stuck to roads.
       Problem Number 3. If it IS Thunder, he's got access to all kinds of weapons - his Dad DOES own a sporting goods store. What do you have? You have the gun you've been storing in your vehicle for seven years - a Smith & Wesson 38 Bodyguard. You have five shots. That's it.
       Problem Number 4. You know a route to Tia's mansion, but it's a bit long.. you might not get there in time.

       Climbing into your car, you rev the engine. Poor baby was never built for this - it's an economy car, not a street machine. But still, you push her to her limits, and fly out of the parking lot, docking your phone in the dash.

       "Dial Star Nine-Nine-Nine." You state, pressing the phone's voice activation mode.

       "Emergency Services, what city and state, please?"

       "Canterlot, Colorado." You state calmly, as you drive like a maniac. You NEVER did anything like this before.

       "Nine-one-one, what is the nature of your emergency?"

       "There's going to be a murder. 13144 Whitecrest Lane. Assailant is a single male, late teens, armament unknown but with access to modern sporting rifles. Target is Diamond Tiara, female, early teens. The assailant is trying to avenge the death of his brother and likely feels he has nothing to lose. He'll probably kill anyone that gets in his way! You need to get cars out there as fast as possible!"

       "Understood, sir, you believe there's going to be a shooting at 13144 Whitecrest Lane? What time, sir?"

       "RIGHT NOW! I'm trying to get there as fast as I can! Diamond Tiara is one of my students!"

       "Understood, sir, please try to remain calm and stay on the line. Don't put yourself in danger, sir, that's what the police are for."

       "You got the address?"

       "Yes, sir."

       "You know how serious this is, right?!"

       "Yes, sir, the police are on their way."

       You were turning down Whitecrest right now. No sign of any responding police cars.

       "Tell them to STEP on it!" You grunt. "HANG UP!" You order your phone, and it complies.

       Finding Tia's place wasn't that hard. It was the only mansion that had a motorcycle crashed through the front gate. You parked on the street and got out, grabbing your revolver and sticking it in your pants.

       "God.. Thunder.. please don't make me shoot you.." A defensive use of firearm is hard enough to stomach - but doing it to one of your former students, to protect one guilty of rape?

       You hop over the wrecked bike and run for the front door. Just as you get there, you hear a gun shot from inside.

       "Fuck! FUCK! No-no-no-no-no..." And in the broken door you go.. passing the body of a slumped-over butler. "THUNDER! THUNDEEEEEERR!" Up the stairs.. up the stairs.. follow the shell casings.

       Yes, multiple shell casings. They're all .308 Winchester. He's probably using a semi-automatic.. you remember that Frost had a really nice CETME in his shop that was tuned for commercial match .308 loads (and thus, being so customized, was very expensive). It seems.. whoever Thunder was chasing.. and you were sure it was him.. they were running, and dodging.. there were bullet holes in the wall.

       More shots. That means they were still alive in there. Where the FUCK were the COPS!?

       You run towards the back of the mansion, and finally round the corner, seeing someone rush into a bedroom. You run in right behind them..

       "THUNDER! STOP!" You yell.. and pull your revolver.

       You see Thunder Lane holding the CETME and aiming it at Diamond Tiara and her father. Her father already has a bleeding wound in his lower abdomen.. and it looks really bad.

       "You.. won't.. hurt her.." He stammers out.

       "THUNDER!" You yell again, and he turns to face you, briefly.

       "TELL ME SHE DOESN'T DESERVE THIS!" He yells. "TELL ME! TELL ME AND PROMISE ME! AND I'LL STOP!" Tears are in his eyes.. he's sobbing, hard.

       "Thunder.. no one deserves to die-" You start in. Just as you hear police sirens off in the distance. You probably had another couple minutes before the first badge got to you.

       "SHE DOES! SHE KILLED MY LITTLE BROTHER! SHE MADE ALL THIS HAPPEN - I HEARD IT! I HEARD SILVER SPOON TELL YOU EVERYTHING! SHE KILLED HIM!" He screams.

       "Pumpkin.." Her father looks at her.

       "..its kinda true, Daddy.." She does look a bit scared. But not totally. "I sent Rumble all those nice pictures and that video I did with that gutter trash, Applebloom." She giggled a little. "It was fun watching her-"

       "SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP YOU HORRIBLE BITCH!!" He screamed at her.

       "You're not going to shoot me, Thunder!" She gave him the most sociopathic grin you'd ever seen, ever, even in movies.

       "FUCK YOU!" He raised the rifle..

       "THUNDER!!" You start to pull the trigger.

       "NOT MY BABY GIRL!" Her father slumps over her..

       ..time seems to slow down as everyone acted all at once. You wanted to shut your eyes and make this all go away, but it wouldn't. This scene is forever etched in your mind..

       *GUNSHOT*



   Epilogue.

   Three months have passed since it happened. Despite shooting a student, you weren't fired. In fact, Superintendent Sombra personally thanked you for putting yourself in harm's way to protect someone, despite what they'd done. But.. only beacause most of the school district saw you as some kind of a hero, and both the FBI Agents and the local police called the shooting a case of defending someone that was clearly in danger of being killed.

   Frost.. well.. he never really forgave you for killing his other boy, but he packed up and left town a month after it happened, and had his boys buried elsewhere. You never had to deal with him again.

   Quill Davenport, on the other hand, had a significantly changed view of you. He no longer saw you as a political dissident, but a psychopath with a gun. Fortunately, no one else really shared his view. He stayed on, but he never again gave you shit for your actions. In fact, he wouldn't even talk to you unless he absolutely had to - he said he was afraid you'd snap and kill him.

   Cheerilee, on the other hand, really didn't have an opinion, other than that you did what you had to do. She never once expessed any disapproval of your actions. Thunder had already killed the butler, after all. You went ahead and decided to date her, casually, and while it hasn't really gone anywhere beyond a kiss or two - and you're not even sure if you want it to - she still defends you when it's called for. She's also lost some weight and pretty much stopped eating for comfort.

   Diamond Tiara's trial was delayed. But she was now facing a lot MORE charges than she originally had. All the students that she framed, were exhonorated. Her father survived the attack on his mansion, and after some expensive surgery, one couldn't even tell that he'd been shot in the gut with a .308.

   Applebloom eventually forgave Silver Spoon for all her misdeeds when she was Tiara's lackey. Friends? No, not exactly, but she wasn't mistreated by Silver Spoon any longer, and the two seemed to get along well enough that when Pair-Up projects came up, the three girls let her in to their group. And that was good enough, you figure.

   Life never REALLY returned to its pre-Scandal state - the 'extra security' measures were there to stay. The infringements on the student's lives were there to stay. Was this a happy ending? No. It was just an ending. The Scandal was over, and so were the lives of two brothers, and the freedom of one young girl. That's not something that can be solved with hugs and cupcakes, but it's the best outcome you could help bring about.
