Part 1: Jakarta Heart

TIME: 21:57 NCT
DATE: War Day 916/11 Decemus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Underneath Jakarta, Dutch East Indies


We needed to exfil. Quickly. We knew we'd be found out, fast, and we were not set up for a protracted engagement. I grabbed the keys and unlocked all the other cells, and encouraged the prisoners to follow us. We'd take as many with us as we could.

K: C> "Shark - be advised, we have another 20 passengers. Send out the other rafts and give me a landing spot! Exfil in 12 minutes!" I gestured to Dusk Seeker. "Come here. You, me, Rarity, point. SPIRIT! You've got the Evac Team!"

Forest Spirit: "G'Heh! BRING IT! I got'cher back!" He hoof-pointed to me.

Rarity: "We are on you, darling." She nodded.

K: "We'll move ahead and make sure there's nothing between us and the Tunnel. Once the POW's get into the tunnel, we take the rear. We have to slow down the enemy. Got it?" I nodded to them.

Dusk Seeker: "Understood." He looked at his father, carried on the stretcher. "..don't die." He glared at Brindle.

Brindle: "Don't.." *Cough* "..plan to." He glared back at him.

I couldn't quite tell what was up, here, but.. I shrugged and moved ahead.

K: "Let's move." I nodded and took the lead, exiting the warehouse-turned-prison.

We hit opposition as soon as we exited. Two Gizmonks returning from a patrol. One shot each from Rarity and Dusk Seeker, dropped them at the same instant. Rarity gave him an appreciative look.

Rarity: "Not bad, darling.. dear Vy was right, you are good." She smirked.

Dusk Seeker: "It's my job, miss Rarity." He shrugged a bit as we huffed to the entrance to the tunnel.

As we reached it, I waved to Forest Spirit, and he led the team over with the POW's.

K: "Switch off. Go first, we'll be three minutes behind. Get to the beach. Don't wait for us. AJ? With us. Go." I pointed.

Applejack: "Darn tootin' I'm with you." She gave a small hiss. "Ah didn't go two weeks without mah stallion t'git separated our first action."

Someone noticed our handiwork in the Warehouse, and came running out, calling for assistance. Dusk and Rarity both put a round each into him.

Rarity: "Mmm.. I think that one was mine, darling." She smirked under her mask.

Dusk Seeker: "Really? I'm pretty sure I hit the heart." He returned.

Rarity: "Yes, and I hit the brain stem." She said, gently narrowing her eyes.

I grinned a bit.. Rarity found herself a rival. Good. She prided herself on her precision? It was about time she had someone good enough to challenge her.

Company started gathering. While our shots were quiet, and these forces having not heard a suppressor before not realizing what they were, missing individuals, and the partial cry for help, sent a whole squad of Gizmonks from the left side of the building.

K: "Take them." I nodded, lining them up. "Left to right."

As we fired our silenced weapons, four went down immediately, the remaining two had just enough time to turn, and were brought to the ground by our next set of shots.

What we didn't see until it was too late was the squad behind them..

Gizmonk: "WE'RE TAKING FIRE! ENEMIES OUT HERE SOMEWHERE, PROBABLY SOUTH-WEST!" He shouted from around the corner.

Then.. an alarm started sounding.

K: "Well, shit." I snorted. "Rest of the mag, grenades, then move."

Dusk Seeker: "Indeed." He slid over just a bit, as a gaggle of Goblins came charging around the corner from the direction of the Goblin encampment.

AJ slid over to be his higher volume cover. I moved to cover Rarity, as armed Gizmonks and a couple Porcine charged from one of the side buildings.

Both sets of us fired at the same time. I know our side put down all our targets, but I didn't see the damage that AJ and Seeker did.

K: "GRENADES!" I ordered, pulling two out. "Dusk, Rairty, go!"

Applejack: "Fun date, honeybun!" She said, whipping two grenades out, and getting them open.

We tossed in a fan pattern, and both pulled back into the tunnel. When they went off, I could hear them inflict some casualties, judging by the screams.

K: "Keep moving! Go!" I ordered.

I watched as Dusk transitioned to his Dager pistol, covering Rarity as she reloaded. She then covered him as he retransitioned back to the Sherman-Spencer, and reloaded as well. All this as we moved up the tunnel - both of them using Telekinesis magic to make the manipulations.

And both now used that selfsame Telekinesis to hold their weapons as they galloped.

Fortunately, the enemy force didn't find the tunnel entrance. We ran/galloped the entire distance back to the entrance.

K: "Pastrami!" I called out.

Pastrami: "General?!" He paced up.

K: "Get your people out of here. We.. we did a thing. It could get bad down here. I don't want civilians harmed." I shrugged.

Silver Spanner: "We're fine, General." She snorted, pulling a Rasmussen Carbine from a crate. "Go on. We got 'dis."

K: "Thanks, you guys." I nodded.

Dusk Seeker: "Pastrami." He nodded firmly.

K: "Come on." I motioned, and off we went.

When we got back towards the shore, I could hear shooting. Looking towards sea-side, I saw HSM Shark surfaced, with two rubber rafts heading for her, and two gunners on the Conning Tower with Abrams MG's, hosing down the shore to our left. I moved, pushing the others ahead, until we got to the raft. It was nearly full, and I got everyone in.

K: "Spirit! Head count!" I called out.

Forest Spirit: "We're good! You're the last four! Come on, heave into those oars!" He encouraged, taking one himself, and hauling his back into it.

We rowed for our lives, with the crew of the Shark covering us, and small arms fire coming from the shore. I saw a crewmember go down, and someone drag them back into the conning tower. I returned fire to the shore line, seeing both Dusk and Rarity doing the same.

Once aboard the Shark, I ushured everyone inside.

K: "GET IN! FORGET THE RAFTS! LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!" I ordered.

Deep Blue: "K! HURRY UP! WE HAVE A SONAR CONTACT BEARING 1-2-5! ENEMY SUB!" She called from atop the sail.

They all scrambled inside, and I climbed up to the bridge hatch, sliding in.

K: "Seal the hatches! Take her down! FAST!" I directed. "Battle stations! Flood the tubes! We can't afford to be shadowed." I leaned over the weapons console, seeing the Shark's torpedo tube indicators light up.

Sea Swirl: "..K! Surface contact, heading out of the harbor! It's a Destroyer!"

K: "We take them first. Range!?"

Sea Swirl: "One-seven-hundred!"

K: "Bearing!?"

Sea Swirl: "Oh-Three-Five. Aft tube, set bearing!"

Deep Blue: "Bearing set!"

Sea Swirl: "FIRE!"

Deep Blue: "Torpedo away!"

I watched as Sea Swirl pulled out her new pocket watch, and counted. We heard the explosion, of course. We also felt one near US!

K: "That's the sub! They missed! Sonar!"

CPO Bird Tweeter: "Bearing one-three-three! Depth fifty! Range.. one-two-hundred!"

Sea Swirl: "Get us on that course. Prepare to fire!" I slid over to the Sonar station.

Deep Blue: "Bearing and depth set! Ready!"

Sea Swirl: "Fire one!"

I watched her hit the plunger. I waited two seconds.

Sea Swirl: "Fire TWO!"

She hit the second plunger.. and both torpedoes were away. The Gyro-Stabilized torpedoes did their thing, and we heard an impact, muffled by the water.

CPO Tweeter: "..positive impact.. sonar contact lost. We got them." She nodded.

K: "Two kills, Sea." I patted her shoulder. "Not bad." I sighed in relief. "Stand down to yellow alert. I'm going below."

Well.. we managed to rescue the POW's and sink two enemy vessels, as well as kill a bunch of enemy troops. Now, we needed to follow this up with an invasion, and liberate the city before anyone else suffered.

My wonder was.. what about Dusk?

LOCATION: HMS Shark, 7nmi NNW of Jakarta, Dutch East Indies


I entered the Shark's sick bay. I knew Brindle would be too out of it to talk, but I wanted to see if Filthy Rich was okay. He was on his side, with all four legs splinted. I could tell he was in pain. So, I sat next to him.

K: "Hey, Filthy." I gave him a smile.

Filthy Rich: "General." He looked a bit away from me. "I'll say it now. I owe you my life." And shook his head. "I.. whatever debts your wife's family had.. forget them." He sniffled a bit. "I never thought anyone would ever come for us."

K: "I didn't know you were missing. I was shot away from the Arctic by a God named Helreignn." I shrugged. "Been here for two weeks."

Filthy Rich: "Ah." He smiled weakly. "Three weeks. I.. I came with Brindle Spindle.. he said I.. might make an investment here.." He winced.

K: "Red? Can we give him anything?" Four broken legs, after all.. I looked at Redheart, who was checking Brindle.

Redheart: "MMmh.. not with his vitals. He's too weak right now." She shrugged. "I give him Morphine, he might not wake up."

K: "Sorry." I looked back at him, giving a sympathetic frown.

Filthy Rich: "Probably.. karma.." He coughed a bit. "..laying there on that filthy floor, I started.. to think.. about all the suffering I caused.. with my money. How I misused it. Abused it. Took my gift and clubbed other ponies over the head with it. I thought, surely, I was to die there, wallowing in my own filth and knowing only regrets.." He frowned. "..all I could think of, was Diamond." He smiled a bit. "But, I think I've failed her. She's become.. a brat.. I see that, now. She feels entitled." He looked up at me. "One.. one father to another.. what do I do?"

K: "Force her to enlist. Make her work a few years. She'll be of-age and graduated from secondary school soon enough. Make her get her hooves dirty. And don't give her any extra cash in the meantime. Make her learn the importance of humbleness." I shrugged.

Filthy Rich: "..thank you, K." He looked away again. "I shall spend the rest of my days making up for my actions. I swear it!" He nodded. "First step." He looked over to me. "You tell me if there's anything the military needs that it can't ordinarily get. I will find a way to get it." He nodded.

K: "Orphans." I blinked.

Filthy Rich: "Orphans?" He cocked a brow, weakly.

K: "Scour Europe and Equestria and Canida and everywhere else. Find orphans. And find them loving families - races be damned to Tartarus." I nodded. "Admiral Kaltbluter of Germaneigh adopted a wolf pup. No reason we can't maintain that tradition." I patted his shoulder. "Children are our future. After this war is over, they'll have to deal with the consequences, and finish rebuilding that what we may be forced to lay to the torch." I shrugged. "To do that, they need a good start in life. Someone to love them. Care for them."

Filthy Rich: "I shall see to it. By the time I can walk again, I will have orphans, and I will have them adopted out." He nodded firmly. "You have my word of honor."

K: "You value that more than money - I gladly and humbly accept." I smiled a bit.

Getting up, I went over to the Ward Room. Dusk was in there, staring into a cup of coffee like it held the secrets of the Universe. I poured myself a cup and slid in next to him.

K: "Dusk Seeker." I nodded. "You okay?"

He took a full thirty seconds to answer.

Dusk Seeker: "I.. am.. able to perform my duties, sir." He nodded a little shakily.

K: "YOU.. just got confronted with mortality, is what." I smirked. "Come on.. I've been here how long? Five years? I know you Ponies, or I like to think I do. You nearly lost him. He's critical right now, as it is." I gestured, taking a sip of coffee and munching a Graham Cracker. "You got reality stuffed in your face, that whatever's going on between you two, you almost lost your last chance to resolve it. And because you're a pony, it's eating you up."

Dusk Seeker: "I wasn't aware our Commander-in-Chief was so well versed in psychology." That wasn't a compliment.

K: "Alright." I shrugged. "Be that way." I pointed at him, with the nibbled Graham Cracker. "But I know darn well that's what went through your head, and what IS going through your head right now. You didn't exactly deny it, Seeker." And I shrugged hard at him. "But, go ahead. Throw this chance away, too. After all, Tirek almost made sure neither of you had another. And you might not, depending on how the war goes."

Dusk Seeker: "Sir.." He snapped his gaze up at me, in a look as if to ask me, with his eyes, how dare I? How DARE.. this human.. stick his nose into HIS family business? Then the hardness faded, as he came to grips with why. "..you care."

K: "I lost that chance myself." I looked him right in the eye. "Several humans I should have made peace with. I mean, I don't know if I'm ever going back. Even discounting that, there's a few I should have made peace with, that I didn't, and they either died or moved away. To say nothing of the Ponies I've failed. And I don't mean our own casualties." I frowned. "I know something about those kinds of regrets, Dusk Seeker, and I don't want someone I care about to go through the same pain as I have, if I can prevent it." I munched the Graham Cracker a bit.

He lowered his head.. realizing that.. probably for the first time in a long time.. someone gave a damn about him.

Dusk Seeker: "I.." He pursed his lips, the scar making it look like a frown. "..we just met, and.."

K: "You're one of us, now." I said, more softly. "When I accepted you as my Royal Guard Liasion? That meant I accepted you as a friend. And while we're at it, drop the 'sir' stuff. I'm just K." I shook my head slowly.

Dusk Seeker: "K." He nodded, with a small grin.. the scar contorting it, but my eyes not rejecting this. "Just Dusk, then, K."

Rarity: "..you do have a very warm smile." She slid in next to me, with a levitated cup of coffee. "You should use it more." She said, softly.

Dusk: "M.. Mi-"

Rarity: "Just Rarity, darling." She smiled at him. "K is right. I've.." She lowered her head. "..my own issues with my parents. It's why I'd taken in my little sister and kept her away from them. But, it's just that. An issue. It's something I should have worked out ages ago." She shook her head. "And, especially after the Herdiet Union.." She looked down at her still-gloved right hoof. "..I sincerely regret not resolving." She looked up at him. "You see perfection, yes?"

Dusk: "Y-Yes, Rarity.. I mean.." He got a funny little grin on his face.

Rarity: "You see an illusion." She telekinetically slid the glove off, and revealed the fissures still present in her hoof nail. She also flicked her neck to the side, and used her magic to hold her hair back, revealing a jagged scar along the back of her head, where no Mane grew. "One I've been very careful to create." She looked at me. "And one my dear monkey friend here, has helped with." She let her hair down and regloved her hoof. "K is trying to tell you, Dusk, you need to talk to him. Resolve this. Before it's too late." And smiled. "That, and perhaps, accept whom you really are. Flaws and all. After all, nopony is perfect. Even me."

Dusk: "..yeah." He looked down at his coffee and smiled a bit. "Uh.. excuse me."

K: "He should be okay to talk for a little bit. But if Redheart says leave him be, you listen." I nodded to him.

Dusk: "Yes, s- uh.. K." And he slid out from his seat, and went down towards Sick Bay.

Leaving me with Rarity.

K: "Remember when I said not to let our affair hold you back?" I stared straight ahead.

Rarity: "Oh..!" She blushed, HARD. "Was a lady THAT obvious?" She put her right hoof to her chest.

K: "As a neon sign." I smirked. "Rivalry? Then heartfelt advice? SAharing lethal danger together? Lowering your defenses first because you know that heroic stallion never would, if you didn't? Come on, this is about the same level of drek as one of your dimestore romance novels!" I smirked, and gave her a bit of elbow.

Rarity: "My word, darling!" She haughtily sniffed the air, throwing her head back, but opened one eye, and leaned in, smiling. "He IS quite the specimen." And shrugged. "I will say, Forest Spirit was.. after the.. the acid slime.. seeing him wounded and scarred like that, but still carrying on?" She smiled broadly. "It made me come to appreciate.. imperfection.. especially as a sign of courage." She raised her head and half-shut her eyes, looking at me. "So, I've your blessing?"

K: "You never needed it." I shrugged. "Go on. See where you can get with him." I held her hooves together. "I will always value the time we spent together, but we both know, I was never the man for you." I shrugged a bit. "I was an affair. A curiosity that happened to care. And I was endorsed." I gave her a grin.

Rarity: "..thank you, K." She slid her forelegs over my shoulder, and hugged me tightly. "Even if I get nowhere, knowing you care so much for me, is more than a Lady could ever ask for, expect, or deserve - a man.. MAN.. like you, watching out for her." She pulled away, and beamed a grin. "Pardon me."

And she slipped out, too.

Applejack took her place after a moment, slipping into the booth seat with me, and sliding her ass onto the table.

Applejack: "What'cha'll think?" She fixed me with a smirk.

K: "I dunno! I mean, he seems like the 'wounded heart, yearning for something more' fixer-upper project that Rarity's novels usually contain. He's brave, he's handsome, and he's smart." I shrugged. "I think it's going to depend on him."

Applejack: "Mmmm..." She slid off her combat boots, and put her bare hooves on my shoulder, then pulled back, exposing her frogs. "..hoof rub?"

I engaged immediately, stuffing the rest of my graham cracker in my mouth before pressing my thumbs to them. I smiled.. she was staring me in the eye with a look of 'This will have to do until we get privacy' and.. I just smirked at her.

What was that I keep saying about healing being painful sometimes? And that good friends can help you through it? I suppose even NEW friends can be just what you need to see what you've become, and realize your faults.

I hoped for Dusk Seeker's sake, he could heal completely, and allow himself happiness.

Luna: "..and let me introduce Admiraal Graaf Alexandre de Boer."

The Dutch Delegation had arrived, from HNMS Batavi, for a breakfast conference. Among them were Admiraal Graaf Alexandre de Boer, and Brigade-generaal Jan Peter Zalm. Graaf de Boer was a salt-and-pepper maned older stallion, tough, and very demanding. General Zalm was a bit younger, with a sea-green coat and blonde locks. They were accompanied by no less than Prime Minister Celestin de Glazuur. A tall, statuesque stallion, he was the picture of governmental refinement and upper class, but with a hawkish intelligence in his eyes. His coat was orange-rust, with a blue mane in a sort of formal parted manecut with a tail reminiscnent of the Rennaisance and Pre-Industrial age.

Twilight Sparkle and Raven Inkswell had come with. Luna was directly representing the royal sisters.

I was in my true winter formals. Everyone else was, as well.

K: "Admiraal. Mister Prime Minister. General." I nodded to each of them, in turn.

Kol. Wolfheze: "Sirs. Graaf de Boer." He nodded as well.

Codr. Roos: "Gentlecolts." She bowed a bit.

Adm. de Boer: "Commandeur Roos.. why are.. you here?" He wagged a hoof at her.

We all kinda looked at each other.

Codr. Roos: "Vice-Admiraal Duerpaard fired Schout-bij-Nacht van Gilders for insubordination. He was then, himself, killed in battle." She lowered her head. "I am most senior officer remaining."

Kol. Wolfheze: "Van Gilders spoke out of turn, sirs." He nodded. "General K of Equestria was dumped into our laps at our darkest hour. van Gilders refused to even listen to him, spouting the same nonsense that had been disproven already." He gestured a bit.

Codr. Roos: "Vice-Admiraal Duerpaard trusted K. As do I. We would not have held out without his leadership and intimate knowledge of the enemy. He was instrumental in the defense of our last position in the East Indies, and in arranging assistance from Neighpon and Equestria. I am to understand, too, that Canida is also on their way." She shrugged widely. "What were we to have done, sir? Mister Prime Minister? Allow our outdated and rigid tactics, poor equipment, and inexperienced leadership get so many brave ponies and deer, killed, for nothing?!" For once, she got animated about something, stepping forwards, and IN FRONT of me. "Likewise.. -I- trust General K." She said, referring to me by my NEIGHTO rank.

Emperor no Ken: "De Generarl.. also rliberated our nation from Tirek. Nearly to de cost of his own life, when Tirek attacked him magicarly from within!" He puffed himself up a bit.

PM Glazuur: "Oh, my!" He laughed. "You misunderstand us!" He bowed a bit. "Princess Wilhelmina has asked me to come and negotiate our entry to NEIGHTO!" And smiled.

Adm. de Boer: "Indeed. We.. we didn't know that Admiraal Duerpaard had been killed in battle." He shrugged.

K: "Well. We welcome all friends to NEIGHTO." I shrugged, and motioned for everyone to have a seat. "The Neigtherlands have proven they're willing and able to stand with us. Moreover, you do have a pretty up-to-date fleet - a few things need to be worked on, but nothing major. You need new small arms." I nodded. "The Rasmussen and Bjarnov are.. kinda out of date? But they're absolutely amazing for being developed independently."

Forest Spirit: "I've seen to it that three of our best officers retrained the East Indies Marine Regiment." He nodded to Wolfheze, then Norfy, Gaze, and Cosmic. "They're a perfect example regiment, and should be taken over to train all of your existing Marines in how to operate to NEIGHTO standards."

Cosmic: "They've performed very well." He nodded. "I've also been informed you lack any heavy artillery - I have schematics and data packets for all basic Equestrian field artillery."

Gaze: "Aye, an' we'll git'ch'a all caught up with armored vehicles, too." He nodded with a grin.

Norfy: "The performance of your Marines leaves nothing to be desired - they are brave, motivated, and have competent leaders. I also understand that officers above the rank of Lieutenant are required to complete collegiate-level courses on personnel management, finance, and a few other subjects. Colonel Cosmic Plane and I will also submit our notes and working course material for an education in combat strategy as well." He gestured to Kolonel Wolfheze and Lieutenant Eik.

K: "In the immediate term, Commandeur Roos wanted the Dutch Marines to lead the first major invasion." I gestured to her. "I understand that desire as a matter of pride." And looked back at the Admiral and General. "However, I have just returned from a special operations mission to Jakarta where I had to rescue some civilian prisoners of Tirek's. We simply do not have enough time to train your fresh Marine troops in how to do things the NEIGHTO way. Tirek's commander in this region, Beezen, is after something very dangerous - he wants to harness the frightening power of the Nirik."

Adm. de Boer: "Th-Those are just.. legends.." He blinked. "..but, if you are serious, then they are not."

K: "Exactly. Jakarta is the first and easiest goal, despite being further away than the area Beezen is searching. Why? Because it will put his position in danger of being cut off, and we have the support of the local Merchant's Guild, through Lunar Guard Altern Dusk Seeker." I gestured to him. "He secured the services of the Merchant's Guild to use these massive tunnels under Jakarta to launch an amphibious assault on the city. The tunnels are large enough to drive armored vehicles through, and large enough to move a whole battalion's worth of troops. It's perfect. Equestrian Marines can easily take the city. Once we do, we can use your Colonial Infantry and Marines - who will be training while we handle the initial invasion - to expand out from the city, and eventually take Surabaya from behind, while Neighponese Marines take it from sea-side with naval support. Once the island of Java is under our control, Sumatra will be almost cut off from a direct route back to Tirek's home lands - he'll have to evacuate his forces or risk destruction."

Adm. de Boer: "Hmmm.." He examined the planning map. "..I see your point. We must move fast, to preserve lives, and deny Beezen this prize. What.. what effect will attacking Jakarta and Java in general, do to hamper him?"

K: "He'll have to reroute forces from Sumatra to support those in Java. I expect another fleet.. but.." I gestured around. "..this time, they'll be the ones on the back foot from the start. We have.. two Fleet Carriers, a Light Carrier, three Battleships, two Battlecruisers, and seventeen Cruisers between us three. Even three Tirek fleets would be no match for our combined power."

B.G. Zalm: "It seems.. a sound plan, Admiraal." He looked at his Naval counterpart. "Ambassador Starlight was correct - General K is as good as he seems." He looked at me. "And if your performance the last two weeks is any indication, you are just as capable a field officer as a strategic officer."

K: "Only because I have knoweldge - and now, experience. I started out with a lot. It's human nature to have conflicts.. wars.. small skirmishes. It's just how we are." I shook my head slowly. "And it's exactly the opposite of all of you. I only seem to be so good because I was a big fish in a small pond. I started out with a squad. Now, I lead multiple field armies. But, it shouldn't be this way. I've said it before, I would fight one on one with Tirek and bear all the risks, including my own life, if it meant none of you had to do any of this. Ever." I frowned.

PM Glazuur: "..and just as humble as she said, too." He grinned. "I think we will make fine friends."

General Sacquet: "Oui. As Assistant Supreme Allied Commander, I welcome our Dutch brothers to the fight." He nodded. "I have, likewise, served with K, and not only testify to his skill, but the warmth of his friendship. He may stand on two legs, mon amis, but he is one of us in his heart." He leaned over and clapped his forehoof on my shoulder. "And his heart bears the weight of every soldier lost, oui? Every one, he thinks of them. We are not merely faceless uniforms. Even the lowliest Recruit is a priceless life, to him."

B.G. Zalm: "Well." He nodded. "I think, then, we accept this plan?" He looked at Admiraal de Boer, then his Prime Minister.

PM Glazuur: "I defer to you, I am not a soldier." He smiled. "But, as a politician, I can say, I feel confident that we should formalize our alliance immediately."

Twilight Sparkle: "As Prime Minister of Equestria, I welcome the chance to negotiate the specifics." She grinned.

Luna: "And as Princess.. I welcome our new friends." She smiled broadly.

Lookout: "General. Admiral." He nodded to Sargasso. "Ship contact bearing zero one zero, she's flying Roaman colors, sir, ma'am." He hoof-pointed to the rangefinder.

I went and had a look. Sure enough.. a very large, very modern battleship.. no, two.. led a pack of Roaman ships.

Comspony: "General. Radio message from Ammiraglio Tortellini. Prepare for flyby." He nodded to me.

K: "When were you going to tell me Gio was coming?" I chuckled.

VADM Sargasso Sea: "I.. I didn't know!" She sniffled. "He.. I asked if he could help.. but..!" She wiped her foreleg across her muzzle.

K: "Coms. Call down to the Conference Room. Let the Dutch Delegation know there'll be a State Dinner this evening, aboard the Roaman Fleet." I smiled.

Comspony: "Aye, sir. Also.. Roaman Flagship requests coms."

I just held my hand out, and accepted the microphone.

K: C> "BON GIORNO, GIO, AMICO MIO!" I laughed, full of emotion.

Adm. Tortellini: C> "BON GIORNO!" *Boisterous laugh* "We were in the neighborhood, yes? Ahh.. we think'a we stop by and get some time working out our new remodels! And maybe our Legions get some time to stretch'a their legs.. and'a their bayonets, eh?"

K: C> "OF COURSE!! More friends, more fun. Spaghetti State Dinner tonight?" I smiled, but I was tearing up, though.. I was so happy to hear his voice.

Adm. Tortellini: C> "SI! SI! Si, amico mio. Bahahaha! Mama wonders how you have been?! I, to, friend. When I hear you were in the East Indies, I say, we have to come help! We must! You fight so hard for all of us.. is the least we can do, eh? See you soon! Impero, out."

Slapshot: "I heard about the last few dinners. Good thing I brought my formal uniform." She smiled a bit.

Rapid Bearing: "Spaghetti formal dinner..? Huh." He nodded. "Oh, General, while you weren't looking, I adopted an apprentice." He slid Wallflower out from behind him.

K: "Wallflower." I nodded. "Welcome." I gestured to Rapid. "Good. Another dedicated engineer on the team." And nodded to Derpy. "Derpy. Good, I want a word with you."

Derpy: "What's up, K?" She trotted over, her husband in tow.

K: "I want you to be in charge of all Special Operations missions." I put a hand on her shoulder. "Senior Colonel."

Derpy: "W-WH-Whaaaaaaaaaat?!" *Hiccup!* "REALLY!? REALLY-REALLY!?" She slam-hugged me. "OH, K! THANK YOU SO MUCH!" *Hiccup-Hiccup!* "Th.. that means.. so much to me." She pulled back, and wiped away the tears.

K: "I mean it. You were the first soldier, ever. The first one to voluntarily grab a weapon and stand with me, unprompted." I nodded to her. "You're smart, tough, and capable." I shrugged a bit. "And you know as much as I do. You've trained so many ponies that've later ended up at my side. I need you in that kind of a role. I'm guessing you'll accept?"

Derpy: "YES! Yes-yes-yes-yes! Ohh.. this is better than a whole CRATE full of muffins!" She hugged me again. "I promise, K! I'll keep doing my absolute best." She nodded to Dr. Whooves. "And I know my dear muffin love will back me up." She nodded firmly. "Oh, and I'd like to select Cheerilee to command the 1st Rangers."

K: "Done." I smiled a bit. "I figured you'd pick her. She's good, too. Disciplined. And very loyal. She's been your Second since the start of the war." I shrugged at her, open palmed. "For the time being, get your formal uniforms ready - there's spaghetti tonight!" I beamed a grin.

More friends means less danger. And promoting Derpy was the only thing I could do - she'd earned it in spades, by this point. And I needed someone as an organizer, now, that we had grown so much.

This was shaping up to be an even easier job than I first thought. My only real concern involved the Kirin, when it came time to make contact with them. Would they accept me? Or see me as someone to fear?

Well, I'll figure that out after some of Mama's Spaghetti..

Part 4: Spilled Spaghetti

TIME: 17:44 NCT
DATE: War Day 919/14 Decemus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: RNS Imperio, Riau Strait, Dutch East Indies

This was a GRAND Battleship.

As with the Rainbow of Light and Yamato, it was approaching the pinnacle of Battleship design. The Ceasar and Rex had been converted into Aircraft Carriers by simply levelling them off at the first deck, and adding a flight deck and hangars.

Imperio was a true Fast Battleship of the post-airplane era. It even had a full aircraft elevator and a belowdeck hangar for its scout aircraft. Add in the 15-inch high velocity guns with a 50km range, and the brand new 57mm guns to be a step up from 40mm's? It was ready to face aircraft that Tirek would one day send - he already had subs, planes would surely come soon.

After all, Tirek would know that he has to retain at least near-parity with NEIGHTO if his war was to be won. He could not leave the skies unchallenged. We would see his innovations soon, I had a feeling, and it wouldn't be super-sized Raptorians.

Speaking of planes, the Roamans had developed their own aircraft. Reggioni S.A. had developed two for naval use, and one for ground use. The two naval aircraft types were here.

The RN-101 Scout Planes and RN-201 Fighter-Bombers were essentially the same aircraft, only the 201's were longer and fatter. They had just completed a smoke color fly-by of the Roaman National Flag's colors. Gio was really pulling out all the stops.

PM Glazuur: "Is this how everyone gets treated?" He asked, as I helped him up the gangway.

K: "On Gio's watch? Yes." I turned and presented myself to him. "Amiragglio Tortellini!" I saluted. "Permission to come abo-GACK!"

I was pulled into a hug.

Gio: "Nonsense with'a all'a that!" He laughed. "Emperor." He nodded, and then eyeballed Rarity.. and Dusk right behind her. "Ahhh! Miss Rarity!" He slid over. "Once again, I make your acquaintence!" He bowed, and offered to take her hoof.

Which.. she refused.

Everyone kinda.. paused at that. That was very unlike her.

Rarity: "Gio, darling." She nodded and bowed her head a little. "Altern Dusk Seeker, this is Admiral Gio Tortellini.. that.. I told you about?" She lolled her head back to Gio, with a smirk.

Dusk Seeker: "Admiral." He stepped a half pace forwards, almost at her side. "Sir." And raised his eyebrows slightly.

I canted my head to the side to look at them both.

Rarity, then, turned to look at me.

Rarity: "It's a work in progress, darling, but Dusk Seeker.." She turned back to Gio. "..is a lady's escort this evening." And cocked a brow, seeing Contessa Torteillini marching up behind Gio.

Contessa Toerteillini: "GIOVANNI!" She hissed. "Quante volte ti ho detto di non rincorrere altre cavalle! Questa è la seconda volta che ci vai dietro! Se non avessimo undici puledri insieme, avrei quasi voglia di buttarti giù dalla nave! Sempre a flirtare! Sempre con gli occhi! Se non ti amassi con tutto il cuore, farei come mi ha detto la mamma e ti darei un calcio dritto nel fianco!" VERY rapid-fire Italian/New Roaman.

I couldn't even pick words out of that, she spoke so fast, and ended with a tail-thwack to his flanks, only for Gio to turn around and embrace her with a kiss.

Gio: "Ed è proprio grazie ai miei occhi erranti che la passione infiamma il tuo cuore, amore mio, ed è per questo che porti con te il numero dodici." He turned to me. "Yes, you hear correctly, my dear wife is with foal."

K: "Gio.. my friend.. my dude.. I'm going to be totally honest, I just heard noise. I know a LITTLE Italian.. er.. Roaman.. but not enough and not at THAT speed!" I grinned.

Everyone had a good chuckle at this display.

Dusk Seeker: "Countess." He bowed to her. "Please, forgive me."

Contessa Tortellini: "Is nothing to forgive." She nodded to him. "When you are.. passionate.. with your soul's mate.." She looked at Gio, and embraced him more tenderly. "..sometimes anger is as arousing as romance."

Applejack: "BOY, HOWDY!" She beamed a grin.

Emperor no Ken: "Mm.. I am honored you think us so close you would air this out before us." He bowed slightly to Contessa Tortellini.

She waved her forehooves in the air with a blush.

Franchesca: "Franchesca, please, mio amicos, amicas." And giggled. "Come, come. Mama awaits."

The dining hall of the Imperio was even MORE impressive than Ceasar's old one, though I could tell, this was partly accomplished with replacable ornamentation that likely didn't remain mounted during combat operations.

The whole dining hall was also attended-to by not only Imperio's Dining Staff, but also, five servants assigned to Contessa's mother. Royal waitstaff, who also functioned as her baggage train, and her personal assitants.

Speaking of? Regina Emeritus Stella Scintillante Veloce - Contessa Franchesca's mother - zipped right over to us all, with big smiles. I was only the first one hugged!

Mama Veloce: "K!" She about strangled me with her loving hug - society lady and Regina Emeritus nothing, mama got muscle. "You make Mama worry!" She hissed and gently slapped my chest. "I hear so many things happens to you!" She eyed Gio. "If you were ten years younger and 20 kilos lighter, I would insist you go with!" She playfully hissed, and hugged Applejack next. "Aww! You look'a so good after the babies! You like being a Mama? I tell you in my blood line, we gotta watch'a out even up to 55!"

She giggled to herself, and slid on over to the rest of the party, as Applejack and I found our seats.

Applejack: "Mama Veloce's as warm as ever. Like fresh apple pie." She beamed a grin.

K: "She's something." I nodded. "I think the War might've given her more purpose. Something to do."

Applejack: "Did YOU know Rarity an' Dusk were..?" She didn't finish the question, as she wasn't quite sure how.

K: "I know they talked aboard the Shark, and he talked to his dad before his dad passed out." I shrugged. "Cody says Brindle will recover, but he'll need time. And close monitoring. Nah, I didn't pry. After I told Rarity not to let me hold her back, I left things up to her and Dusk. I mean, I could see how bad she was for him - he's her dream dude in a lot of ways, but real. And he? He looks so lost and lonely, he looks like he almost gave up. I ain't his Broham yet, it's not my place to push him to her. So, I let them do as they please. Seems to have gotten SOMEWHERE.. work in progress? Mmm." I smirked. "He'll do right by her, I know that, whatever that means."

Applejack: "Sh'ore 'nuff, honeybun." She grinned devilishly. "Now, we gotsta werk on Sunset!"

K: "Jackie!" I hissed. "You're acting like this was your doing."

She turned to me with the most lusty, romantic gaze.. and smiled just a tiny bit.

Applejack: "Matchmakin's in the blood, honeybun. I had a hand in Twilight 'n Flash, too." She shifted her hips in the chair. "Told him not't'be so intimidated. Told her ta'take a chance. Rares? Mmm. 'Fore she came to ya, she did ask what you'd think. I told her t'ask'ya." And she leaned in for a kiss, as everyone else got to their seats, then whispered to me. "Ah'm doin' what I'm good at. Plantin' new apple trees!"

Once again? It was homemade from start to finish. The noodles, the sauce, the meatballs, everything. The Tiramisu for dessert was even better than the last one. I knew for a fact Mama Veloce had done the cooking, again - former Regina or not, she was a mother first.

Shocker?

THIS time.. Rarity HELD BACK on the wine.

K: "That's only your second glass, Rarity.." I led in, as we were almost to dessert.

Rarity: "We have not yet won, darling." She gently toasted me with it. "One should only drink to merry excess when one is very happy. And I shall reserve that for after we liberate these poor ponies, deer, and Kirin, from Tirek's clutches."

Dusk: "Yeah.. don't drink when you're sad. It just hides pain." He nodded a bit.

K: "Wise." I gave Rarity a look.. she gently raised an eyebrow back.

No, I got it. She WOULD have gotten drunk as a skunk if she hadn't met Dusk, and had him escort her. If she was still.. somehow attached to me.. she would have gotten herself blasted again, and dragged me into bed with her and AJ.

No, no.. this was.. 'I've met a nice stallion, but I know what will happen if I drink, and I do not want it to be like that.'

She was being.. a true Lady about this.

For his part, Dusk seemed well at ease with the State Dinner's trappings. He'd likely had to endure stuff like this as a Colt. Eating with rich and powerful people. Being on his best behavior. And now, he had positive motivation. Every now and then, I could catch a glimpse of him.. and he was very gently smiling the whole time.

Stallion was on top of the world.

AJ spent much of the night going between talking in her usual tone, and whispering into my ear what was going to happen to my uniform afterwards, and that she was intentionally getting decently blitzed.

As you know, by now, she has to do this. To dull her nerves. Otherwise, I wear her out completely, and quickly, even with her magically enhanced stamina from being an Element. And she prefers to go the FULL distance with me, to feel that closeness...

K: "Well.. that was a fine-"

I was hoof-shoved into the bed. Face down. I felt my boots get pulled off. Rolling over, I had that tan muzzle in my crotch. She was getting those pants down..

Applejack: "We's gonna do it good and proper, honeybun.." She drunkily murred.

Spike stuck his head in at that point, and kinda.. froze.

K: "Yes, Spike?" I quickly moved AJ's head, and re-zipped.

Spike: "Ahh.. S-Sorry.." He was blushing.

K: "Come on." I sat up, and playfully rolled the drunk and horny wife off to the side. "What's up? I know you - you wouldn't have poked your head in if you didn't think you could get here in time." To NOT see me naked, I mean.

Spike: "Ahh.." He slid in and slipped up into the bed with me, sitting cross-legged.

It was then that I realized how much he'd GROWN. He was a true young man, now.

AJ: "What's up, sugarcube?" She said, trying to keep it together.

Spike: "I.. need.. some advice. From.. from a dad." He was red faced.

K: "It's about Smolder, isn't it?" I smirked.

Spike: "Y-Yeah.. she.. ah.. she invited me to her quarters.. and.." He rubbed a claw-hand behind his head. "..I think she wants to 'do it' but.. I'm.. not sure I'm really ready."

K: "You're fourteen, Spike. It's a bit young to start in with that. I get the hormones. I was a teenager once, too.." I shot AJ a look like, don't make a snide comment. "..and I get the desire to expend that lust, but.." I shrugged. "..if she's in heat or whatever you dragons call it, you're a bit young to start a family, buddy."

Spike: "That's.. kinda.. what I thought, too." He cleared his throat. "But I don't want to let her down, either."

K: "If she loves you, she'll understand wanting to wait until you're a bit older. At least the same age Twilight was when she got pregnant with you." I patted his shoulder. "Stick to kissing. And.." I rolled my head a bit. "..the self-service pump."

Spike sighed with a bit of relief. Like, I had just taken a ten ton weight off his shoulders.

Spike: "Thanks." He gave me a quick hug. "I guess I just needed to hear it."

K: "Sometimes, we know we're in the right, but just need confirmation." I tousled his head spikes a bit. "Go on. Tell her you have strong feelings for her, but you're just not ready to take that step, that risk, yet." I nodded.

Spike: "Thanks, Uncle K----." He slid off the bed and took off.

AJ: "Well! If that don't beat all!" She smirked, and threw herself, drunkenly and lustily, into me. "..oh, and don't think yer gettin' away THAT easy. Fatherly advice 'n carin' 'n stuff? Turn on." She nuzzled my neck. "Ah LOVES it when MAH stallion acts like a real Alpha.. bein' all fatherly an' commandin' and stuff.." Her words slurred until her lips met mine.

And I did pay for my two weeks of absence, properly, here. It was a very slow, passionate burn between us. A needy, greedy desire for closeness and multiple releases. We NEEDED each other.. I needed to feel her, smell her, mix my soul with her.. and she needed my reassurance.. my soul.

I have no idea how long we lasted, as I.. rather passed out inside her.

Part 5: Jakarta Strike/OPERATION: Coffee Bean

TIME: 00:53 NCT
DATE: War Day 922/16 Decemus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: HMS Haltimer County, Offshore of Jakarta, Dutch East Indies

I was inside one of the AAV's with my command staff. We squeezed one more into the ship from the cargo vessel carrying bulk equipment (it had very limited ability to drop AAVs in the water properly, and was being used as a general stores ship). Our driver was Norfy. Cosmic was on the 20mm gun with Firecracker Burst as his loader, and Gaze was up top at the 11mm.

The rest of us in the back.. AJ, Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Sunset, Toola Roola, myself, Dusk, Dusty, Slapshot, Rose Pompadour, and Cody Allcome.. were all ready for a fight. This was a real invasion - and it would be perfect practice for the actual invasion into Tirek's home land.

Dusty: "Well.. we're ready." She sighed, and checked her weapon again. "This better work." She frowned.

Gaze: "Oh, it'll work, lass." He chuckled to himself. "We put these through their paces well 'nuff. The AAV's don't leak, that's fer sure."

Fluttershy: "It will work. We will free these ponies and deer. I just know it!" She nodded firmly.

Toola Roola: "I agree." She held up a quick charcoal sketch of a landing invasion by ponies.. endless lines coming from landing vehicles..

Rarity: "Indeed, Darlings." She nodded in agreement.

Rose: "I'm just glad I get to help!" She beamed a grin.

The Haltimer County class landing ships, despite being called LST's, had a proper ship's pointed bow, but had a split at the top, one deck up, to open like a clamshell, and allow the armored vehicles to offload. Since AAV's could swim, they could just drive off the ramp.

The Higgins Boats carried only infantry, and 24 per boat - a full Platoon. The Haltimer County-class vessels could offload 788 troops if every boat was used, but carried only 720 normally. This "extra space" was.. more or less if the CAG decided to come along. In this case, the rest of our team would be dropping in the 10m launch, and a couple of the 5m's.

K: C> "Alpha to Mike Charlie." I called Forest Spirit.

Forest Spirit: C> "Go, Alpha."

K: C> "Initiate Operation: Coffee Bean." I looked to everyone else, and nodded.

Forest Spirit: C> "Roger, Alpha." Then, he came on everyone's comms. C> "This is Commandant Forest Spirit. Initiate Operation: Coffee Bean. Good luck to you all."

After a moment, I could hear the clamshell open. We were just far enough out to sea that the enemy shouldn't detect us until we were right on top of them. No preparatory bombardment. We wanted the city intact. Select air strikes, and 5-inch gun artillery only. The Fleet would guard the landing, but only a few Destroyers, and the Carrier, were assigned to cover the landing.

I felt the AAV lurch forwards.. Norfy tapped his hoof on the hull. And we were away.

Once I felt us hit the water, I stood up, and slid back the landing hatch roof. I wanted to see this. Being human, I was just tall enough to be able to stand on the bench shelf and look out over the hatch.

The path to the beach..

No return fire from shore..

It was working.

The distance closed rapidly.. and we were the first AAV in the line. Behind us, I could see the 10m launch with Gilda, Teddy, Lightning Dust, Blizz, Rapid, Wallflower, Radio Active, Mac, Ochre, Dawn, and Ollivine. Behind that were two 5m launches with Dex, Steela, Lyra, Bon-Bon, Octavia, and Vy in one, then Webley, Opaline, Rocket, Flamu, Filament, and Wick in the other. Behind that was the rest of the 1st and 2nd Marine Regiments.

I looked ahead.. we were less than 30 seconds from shore.. and finally, someone on the coast noticed us. I tapped Rarity and Dusk, and pointed, at the incoming tracers. They whizzed past us, but before I could tell them to shoot, they were already putting precise suppressed shots on target. Three each, and they ceased. The alarm had been raised, though. The enemy was alert..

..but we were about to outflank them.

Norfy: "We're on the beach! Which way, K?" He called up.

K: "Off to the right, then straight ahead by 40 meters." I pulled down my mic. C> "Alpha to Dog One through Dog Twelve, follow me. Dog One-Four through Two-Four, follow Mike Alpha. All Ink callsigns, when you hit the beach, follow your markers with your assigned Dog teams. Let's show everyone what Equestrian Marines can do! HOO-RAWH!"

We stayed in the AAV and slowed a bit, so our assigned stick - 1st Regiment, 1st and 2nd Comapny - could catch up to us. Once they did, we led them right to the tunnels.

I was right.. Dusk was right.. the tunnels had plenty of room for these things. I could even sit comfortably up a bit further, right behind the turret.

K: C> "Dog One through Dog Six, on me. Dog Seven through Twelve, take the tunnel marked in yellow, then split between Blue and Red." I relayed.

All part of the plan.

We advanced up the tunnel, and Pastrami was there to greet us.

K: C> "Alpha Stick - hold up." I called, as I jumped out with Dusk. "Pastrami." I nodded. "How're you holding up?"

Pastrami: "Good'ta see'yas." He nodded back, and clapped a hoof on Dusk's shoulder. "You made it out! How's your pops?"

Dusk: "..he will live." He nodded a bit. "Tunnels are clear?"

Pasrtami: "Yeah! Just like we promised." He smirked.

K: "DUSTY! MURDER PRESENTS!" I called back to our AAV.

Dusty: "Comin' up, K!" She ducked down, and came back up with a Chaffee, two Knoxes, and three Bradleys, with ammo bandoliers. She jumped down and handed them off to Pastrami and his crew. "Courtesy of the Equestrian Marine Corps." She nodded, with a small grin. "And the Las Pegasus Metro G's." She slapped his foreleg playfully. "Come on, Pastrami. You think you're good? Show a gal."

Pastrami: "Ooo.. a dare, heh? Sure!" He motioned to his crew. "Come on, let's make some mischief."

I saw Silver Spanner grab a satchel full of TNT, and his crew headed up one of the other tunnels as we re-mounted the AAV.

We drove to our next split point, and I manually pointed to Dog One through Dog Three to take that turn. Dog Four, Five and Six would follow us.

Our exit point was right next to the Warehouse. When we got to the ramp, I got out and took point personally, and helped Norfy and the other drivers behind him go up the twisting ramp. No rails, so, they needed a guide out ahead to watch.

Once we got to the exit, we would be right behind the Goblin Encampment. As I expected the hole was boarded up, but not solidly enough to resist an 18-ton vehicle.

K: C> "This is Alpha with Dog Four through Six. We are in position."

Blinda: C> "This is Mike Charlie Two, in position."

Dog One: C> "This is Dog One, in position."

Ink One: C> "This is Ink One, we are in position."

Ink Seven: C> "Ink seven, in position."

K: C> "Mike One, how copy?"

Forest Spirit: C> "All callsigns in position! ATTACK!"

I jumped up onto the front of the AAV and climbed up next to the turret, hanging on to one of the lashing rings for dear life.

K: "GOOOO!" I called, and slapped the hatch.

The AAV slammed through the barricade, and drove at almost full speed out into the courtyard. Once we did, the enemy zeroed in on us. We started taking fire from multiple angles. My crew popped up from the rear hatch, and started returning fire. I slung my Grant over my shoulder, and slid over to the pintile Browning.

Time to fuck shit up.

On my knees - more or less - I slid the heavy MG around at a pair of Gizmonks on top of the warehouse roof, and just squeezed the lemon squeezer-like grip and let loose. With the solid pintile mounting, there was no recoil, so I pulled the point of aim across both of them, watching them get almost cut in half. Cosmic on the 20mm travered around and picked out another one, trying to line up a shot with a copied Walker. He fired a three shot burst.. and.. there wasn't much left of the guy, especially after the Walker's warhead blew up.

Once we were in the clear, I jumped down, and motioned for everyone to come down with me.

K: "COME ON! Our objective is the Goblin HQ!" I pointed up to Cosmic. "Watch our backs!"

Everyone bailed out, and we charged right up the side of the building. Each Troop had an objective, and their AAV would cover them. I could see we already had calls for air support, as an S-2 Owl floated overhead and dropped flares behind us somewhere. The pilot was using minimal engine power for stealthiness - with the Owls' gas bag, he could do that for a bit without risk. Smart.

They all jumped out of the AAV, sides and rear. I slid off the front and rolled, getting to my feet, and leading the way. AJ, Dusk, and Rarity were right with me. I noted Rose was hefting both a Knox and a Funston.. she was really going for the big booms.

I checked my Grant, and scurried down the wide alley way with the rest of my team, sliding to the corner, and lowering myself so I'd be below the height of the broken wall out front. Once we had everyone spread out, I grabbed a small mirror, and gave a quick look over the edge.

K: "Rose. Dusty. Dash. Load Timed Fused. Rose at 20, Dusty 30, Dash 50, me 40. Sunset, Rarity, Dusk, go after us. AJ, give them cover." Since AJ had taken over as our team's machine gunner, with Twilight going on to other duties. I popped the Gavin's chamber and loaded my Timed Fuse grenade, set the sight to 40 meters, and.. "GO!"

We whipped our bodies just over the edge, and fired our grenades all at once. They landed in a ripple, and while they went off at the same time, the ripple effect caught A LOT of Goblins in the blast and fragmentation radius. I ducked down and pointed to Sunset. She whipped over with her Kreuger - Dusk and Rarity having Spencers - and started picking shots as AJ unleashed her Abrams on the far flank with me. AJ chased them right into the scopes of the Sharpshooters.

I crawled forwards, loaded an Impact Fuse grenade, got around the far edge of the stone wall, and picked off another shot, this time aiming for their weapons and ammo supply tent. I hit SOMETHING, because I got a big, bad explosion out of it.

K: "RELOAD! FRESH MAGS!" I called out - not having fired my Grant, yet, I didn't. "OVER THE TOP!" I encouraged.

I slid out from the side of the stone wall, and started walking in fire - rifle to shoulder, picking targets, putting rounds into them. I had to aim down, since they were all shorter than me, and that meant I had to glance up on occasion to see where I was going. AJ was next to me, mainly laying down suppressive fire, though she did take a few specifically aimed shots now and then.

We broke through the outer courtyard easily, and got to the HQ building. Our objective was to clear it out. Slapshot was right there with the satchel charge, and we slid to the side, to avoid the blast.

Dusk and I were in first, and the building was hopping with activity - Goblins running this way and that, not having any orders, and half of them unarmed.

K: "GET ON THE GROUND! GET ON THE GROUND AND GIVE UP!" I screamed.. nay.. bellowed.

Dusk: "HANDS! HANDS UP! SHOW ME YOUR CELESTIA-DAMNED HANDS!" He cornered a couple of them, and kowtowed them with his commanding presence.

Dusty: "GET OVER HERE YOU GREEN SHIT!" She leaped onto one that had a lot of decorations on his jacket (and no pants), and quickly cuffed him.

It figures - Dusty and Dusk had the most experience with something like this. The girls moved in, and AJ lasso'd three of them at once, pulling them off the second floor landing, and down to the ground.

I stepped to the room the decorated goblin came from, with Slapshot, and kicked the door. Inside? Another female goblin, naked, who quickly covered herself upon seeing us.

K: "Secure her, Corporal." I pointed, and moved on to the next room, backed by Fluttershy. The door got kicked, and inside was a communications center.

Fluttershy: "GET OUT OF THE WAY!" She said, not yelling, but demanding - the Goblin technicians did just that, and Fluttershy hosed down the equipment with her rifle. "The room is clear, K. And I know that's alright with you." She smiled, and pointed her rifle at the Goblins. "Now march! You've all been VERY naughty! You should all be ashamed of yourselves! Come over here!" She demanded.. and they did.

I moved to the last room on this floor, now backed by Rose and Sunset. Sunset just fireballed the door down, and once we saw that this led to an exit hallway.. with several large Porcine coming this way with Pershings, I pulled Sunset back.

K: "BACKBLAST CLEAR!" I knew what Rose would do.

She got on one knee, whipped down the Funston, aimed at the first Porcine in line, and fired her rocket. It slammed into the metal armor plate the Porcine was wearing, and detonated, blowing the pork monster apart, and killing his comrades with both metal and bone shrapnel.

K: "Secure that back door!" I pointed to them, and moved back to the main room. C> "Mike One - HQ Secure! Alpha's Sector is Secured. Ready for retasking. Ink Romeo One, we have prisoners!"

Calling the Infantry Reserve to move up and take them out of here, of course.

I looked around at our handiwork.. 32 captured Goblin fighters, 2 Goblin officers, 2 female Goblins, communications destroyed, and the HQ secured, with weapons and munitions denied to the enemy.

Not a bad piece of work.

Forest Spirit: C> "Understood, Alpha! Stand by!"

And now.. for the rest of the city. Block by block, if we had to. We would push them out, and free these people.
