    Sophomore Year. Time for bitches and ho's. You've got your license because your parents think you're responsible! And a cheap-ass car to go with it.

    Wait, no, no.. that's not right at all. No, this is you practicing for college - taking the right classes, getting the right tests done, the works. Oh, yes, and avoiding a school full of bullies. The list goes on - and they're all girls, so, you can't fight back without getting in trouble.  Oh, and surviving without any friends. Even the girl with the lazy eye avoids you. Because you're a transfer student. Fuck your life, right?

    Yes, fuck your life. Because one of the worst is Sunset.

    She jelly of your #swag? No, but you do get better grades than her in three different subjects (Science, Math, and History). Is she failing anything? Who knows. You don't care.  What you'd love to do, is get her off your damn back. Her and a couple others.

    "HEY DWEEB!" Fuck. There's Gilda.

    Run? Nope. There's Dash right in front of you.

    "Heyyyy... uh.. ladies!" A gentle cough-and-grin on your part. "Takin' anyone to the Christmas Dance?"

    "Cut the crap. You know the deal." Dash gets right up in your face.

    "Yeah." Gilda, right behind you. "Give up the goods."

    No lunch again today. You just pull the fiver out of your pocket and hold it up. Dash already has the locker open, so you offer no resistance as you're stuffed inside. Fuck your life. And they're not even the worst - they're just the most violent. No, the worst is Sunset.

    Being stuffed in these lockers often enough, you now know how to get the latches undone from the inside. You just wait a bit for them to leave - and someone with blue hair to stop leaning against the locker - before you get out and go on. You've already missed much of Lunch. Not that you have any cash for it anymore. But, you've prepared. Somewhat. A trip over to your own locker, and you quickly wolf down your hidden snacks before getting to the library.

    Time for a little studying.

    The school's policy of "permitted free roaming" and open library access during lunch is awesome, especially given that your class right after lunch is right next door.You sit in the small table nook at the corner of the library, between a couple of shelving units. This used to be where the microfilm projector was, until they upgraded to iFruit and other digital formats. A private place. Your private place. There's two weeks until Christmas Break! And you have three major tests.. so, study-study.

    Oh, shit.. you can hear Sunset in the Library..

    "..that damned book on the Renaissance!?" She finished her sentence as she gets within earshot.

    You look up and see the one she means (mentioned by the history teacher) just off to your right.

    Fuck.. fuck.. okay.. don't panic.. You slip it off its place on your side of the shelf, and put it spine-out on top of some books on the other side, through the gap between the book tops and the shelves.

    "THERE! Figures someone didn't put it back." *UGH* She snaps it off the shelf.. and causes six other books to fall down. "DAMNIT!" You can hear her gathering then up. "I really.. I just don't need this right now.."

    Sunset acting like she isn't anything but perfect? What heresy is this?

    "Fucking.. human holidays.." She puts the last book in place, and moves away.

    What the hell did she mean by that? Oh, well. The day of torment comes to a close. Final period. History.

    With Sunset. Fuck.

    Mr. Turner assigns everyone a major project! Yay? Well, it's the kind of project you can excel at - a diorama about any period of history you care to think about. You immediately decide to honor an ancestor and do the English Civil War.. hm.. Battle of Marston Moor.

    "But.." Mr. Turner says. "..you must do this with a partner."

    FUCK YOUR LIFE.

    Oh, and to make things worse? There's exactly an even number of people in class. And everyone partners up immediately.

    Except you and Sunset.

    WHY DOES GOD HATE YOU!?

    "Looks like you two are stuck with each other, Sunset and Anon." Mr. Turner writes your names together. "Just to be fair, because I know tests are coming up before break, I'll make this due the day after we get back. That's a month, or so." Yeah, no kidding, the way the calendar was arranged, you got 18 days off instead of just 14.

    The bell. THANK GOD, THE BELL.

    You escape with a quickness. TO THE CAR! TO THE CAR! TO-Ah, shit, it's Sunset.

    "Listen up, Nerdboy." She's glaring at you.

    "Please don't kill me.." You slink back against your car, and hold your hands up defensively.

    "..I wasn't planning on it unless you fucked this up for me. I can't.. can't afford to fail this." She's not glaring as hard. "Now, we need to discuss what we're going to do." She crossed her arms. "And my car is in the shop, so, you're driving me home."

    "H-Hey, you can't make me do things outside of school, you know!" You get your door open.

    "Listen up, you little worm.." She pokes you in the chest. "..I don't like this any more than you do, but the most efficient use of our time is going to be planning what we each need to do so that we don't have to be seen together. Ever."

    "O-oh. Okay. Makes sense." A blink. "Get in."

    And so, the two of you get into your cheap-ass Honda. And you start driving towards where she tells you. As you do, your mind is working.. you're basically pulling a 91.5% in this class.. the project is worth 10% of the final grade.. you could tank the project and still get a B. Which is enough to keep your car privileges.

    A smirk forms.

    "...have you been listening to a word I've been saying!?" She demanded.

    You pull over to the side of the road, and turn off the car.

    It was time.

    "Listen up. I'm pulling a 91 in the class. I could throw this project in the gutter and still score a B if I ace the finals. Which I will." Your eyes narrow at her, as her brain begins making the connections.

    "You.. you're going to BLACKMAIL ME?!" She screams.

    "Now.. now.. don't think of this as blackmail." You smirk, but you get grabbed around the collar.

    "LISTEN HERE, YOU WORTHLESS LITTLE SHIT!" She shakes you and balls up a fist.

    "I wouldn't threaten or hit me." You narrow your eyes a little. "We're not in school. I can go to the actual cops." A shrug. "You want more Community Service?"

    "YOU... YOU..!" She snorts - you swear you see steam come out of her nostrils.

    Oh, wait, that's because the heater barely works in this thing, and it's cold as fuck out here.

    "You want to hear my proposal? Or would you rather me help you tank the project?" A shrug as you get her hands off your jacket.

    "FINE! Get.. get on with it.." She crosses her arms and huffs.

    "Simple. No more trash cans, no more walking up to me in the hallway and calling me names. No more spreading lies about me. No more shit. Please." You give her a sigh. "I'm sick of being treated like shit by everyone in the school. I just want you to back off for the rest of the year."

    "Oh.. is THAT all!?" She sounded shocked.

    "What were you expecting?" You give her a weird look.

    "Well.. just saying.." A haughty huff. "..you have a certain amount of power over me until the project is done.. you could demand all sorts of things out of me." She closed her eyes and shrugged confidently. "If I was in your position, I'd basically force me to do most of the hard work, while you tell me what to do."

    "Ah. Well, actually, I have most of the materials for the project already. I just need to repaint them. And an idea. Battle of Marston Moor - one of my ancestors died there. I've got the materials to make the diorama of the battle.. I was just wondering if you could program some sound effects? The written part I already have thought up, too. I was thinking - since you have the better speaking voice - that you give the overview, while I show off and explain the individual pieces and sections."

    "Mmm..what?" She tilts her head at you, her face twisted in perplexion.

    "Look.. we're going to have to meet up so I can show you what I'm talking about. Tomorrow, after school?"

    *Sigh* "Fine." She shrugs. "Now, home, Anon. I'm tired and I have to get to work."

    She works, too? You didn't know that.

    You get her home - it's an apartment building in the city proper - and drop her off. It doesn't occur to you that this is an awfully small apartment building..

    The next day, after school, you take her to your place. You already warned Mom and Dad that you'd be bringing a female over, and you're working on a history project together. FORTUNATELY.. your folks are cool, and Mom agrees to stick to her home office. Dad will be at his job site, so, they won't humiliate you any worse than you already get at school. Getting her into your messy-ass basement? That was another matter.

    "Are you serious? The basement?" She sniffs. "Smells like mold.."

    "It's fine. This is where all my miniatures are." You continue, and lead the way.

    And right there, in the main room, is your largest miniature set-up. It was a medieval-based field game. Lots of dice, fuckton of rules, that sort of thing.

    "What the hell nerd crap is this?" She looks ready to gag.

    "Sword and Board." You shrug. "It's a field-based game where you portray individual battles. Something like Warhammer. You've.. heard of Warhammer? Right?" A cocked brow.

    "No. I don't get into that nerdy, time-wasting crap." She frowns and goes over to the miniatures. "These aren't TOO fragile, are they?"

    "Nah, they can take a few hits." You shrug and lead her over to the Field Making Supplies. A spare medium field board, fake grass rolls, then a large chest-of-drawers with all the little bits like house parts, walls, stones for roads, that sort of thing, all properly organized inside.

    "Nerd crap." She snorts.

    "Nerd crap that's going to get us an A+." You remind her.

    "Fine. Fine." She gives a dismissive hand-wave. "We need to hand in an overview by tomorrow, though."

    "Got it covered." You hand her a sheet of paper from your bookbag.

    She reads it, and nods a little. "Okay. Okay. This isn't so bad." She looks at you. "So, you want me to give the presentation, and get some correct sound files to program into it.. anything else?"

    "I might ask you to help strip the paint so I can repaint them. I'm going to be painting about a hundred or so of these things." You shrug. "It's not hard. I'd just have you sitting there and dunking them in paint stripper for a bit, then taking them out and dunking them in water. On a rack. Paint comes right off." You show her the custom-made dunk-and-dry rack you and your father made.

    "I'm shocked.." She blinks. "..I really thought I was going to have to do all the work myself."

    "Yeah, well, the bonus I get for A's on my report card is worth the work." A smirk. "My folks promised to pay my gas needs, insurance, and repairs as long as I don't get more than a couple B's."

    "I.. see." She lowers her head a moment, and you can hear her mumble something.

    "What was that?" You raise your head to her.

    "N-Nothing!" She turns a bit red. "Is there anything you need from me, like, today? I want to get home."

    "Not today." A nod. "Come on, I'll drive you home."

    Her home was on.. just about the other side of town from your place out in a subdivision right at the west end of town. That's a long ways off. About ten minutes, even by car. That's mostly due to the city not being centralized hardly at all, and having to take a slew of side roads to get anywhere unless you live right along the main arteries to the city's denser core. Which was basically the eastern side, against a river and some low hills that formed a state park. There was little development farther east of that, but the town spread westwards from the core, making it look like someone spilled grey paint, on a map. Oh, well. That's just a minor annoyance. Never mind that the high school was closer to your house than it was Sunset's place.

    You get her home, and the next day, get approval from Mr. Turner for your outline.

    That's Wednesday down.

    Thursday, Sunset doesn't work, so you schedule a crafting day with her. Her Community Service was every Saturday. So, you schedule Sunday as well - Friday, she works. Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, she also works. You get her assistance on Sunday and Thursday.


    Thursday..


    The two of you get together. Mom has a meeting, Dad's at the job site again. No parents!

    "So.. you DO have Parents.. right?" She tilts her head at you.

    "Yeah. Dad's working to get a project done before Christmas, Mom's got a meeting - she mostly works at home, but she does investing banking." Very odd question.

    "Ah. Right." She rubbed her arm with her hand and went over to the clearly-marked bins. You had the figures all set out for her, too. "Now.. I just clip them into the rack thing, and dunk them?"

    "Yep. For ten minutes each. I have an egg timer there, if you'd rather just use that to time it." You nod to the items in question.

    "And what will you be doing?" She tilts her head. "Waiting on me?"

    "No, I got my laptop here. I'll start working on the oral report." So, you sit down and start on that while she gets the first load all hooked up and dunked. "So.. I had a couple relatives at this battle.. I'm mostly English and Scots.." You shrug. "What's your genealogy look like?"

    "U-Uh.. w-well.." She blinks a little. "You'd never believe me." She says, bitterly.

    "Try me. What, are you secretly Snackbar?" A smirk.

    "Snackbar..? N-No." She didn't get the term.

    "What ARE your Nationalities, then? French? You look French, I think. In the face a little. Bretange, maybe.. "

    "No. No, I'm not any of those. I'm.." She looks around a little. "..I'm from here."

    "Yeah, I get that, but where are your ancestors from?" A shrug, as you type. Multi-tasking!

    "Uhmm.. mostly.. around here?" She's lost, trying to think of something you'd buy. "I mean, they came and settled here."

    "Ahhh.. that's a mixture.. Irish, German, some English and Scots.. not many French, though."

    "Y-Yeah. I'm.. a mix of that.." She mutters. "..I suppose.."

    "You really don't know, do you?" You tilt your head to her. "Have you asked your parents?"

    "Uh-what?" She blinks like a deer in the headlights. "I don't think this has ANYTHING to do with the project, Anon!" She finally says.

    "Well.. I thought that if we could reference our own ancestors in the battle, it'd make it seem that much more connected to why we picked it." You shrug.

    "O-oh." That shut her up.

    The egg timer went off, and she went about dunking the figurines into the water to wash the paint off.

    "You might have to give them a quick scrub with the brush, there, to get in some of the paint out of the small nooks and crannies."

    "R-Right." She tended to her task. Sensitive issue? Whatever.

    The afternoon went on mostly like this - mostly silence, but you'd interject with a few key facts she ought to know for the report. She avoided every single attempt by you to inquire about her past/ancestry/etc. So, whatever. She seemed to be getting informed well enough, absorbing and reciting the facts back in her own words.


    Sunday.


    "What!?" She says over the phone.

    "My folks are having some people over for a drinking party or some shit. We have to get the oral section done anyway - I may as well go over to your place. I know where it is, and all. And you did say you were free, today."

    "Uhmwell.." She sounded frustrated. And scared. All at once. "..fine.."

    She sounded totally defeated. The coffee shop was closed on Sunday, so.. you'd drive over there. At the apartment building.. let's see.. she didn't bother to tell you the apartment number, but her name was on the mailboxes.

    Just.. one name. "S. Shimmer."

    What, no Mr. or Mrs. Shimmer?

    Apartment six. So, in the building you go. And you realize this place is a run-down piece of shit. Like, hardcore. Broken stairs, the crying of a baby in the background, peeling paint.. shit.. and you thought you had it bad with the bully problem! Up to her apartment, and you knock.

    She answers with a stern look on her face.

    "Get in here, Anon. Don't let them see you." She pulls you inside..

    ..and you realize that this is a studio apartment. A small one, at that.

    What.. the.. fuck?

    "..what the hell..?" You blink at the scene before you. A bed in the middle of the room made up of two old mattresses. A small coffee table that's long since seen better days. Some crappy bookshelves that look like they were scavenged from a dump. The kitchenette had just a stove. No microwave. There was a metal pot and a frying pan. The refrigerator looked like it was made in 1955, and was rather on the short side. The bathroom was a half-bath - a toilet, a washstand, and a shower stall. There's clothes hanging up in the stall, and you can smell laundry detergent, thusly indicating that she washed her clothes by hand.

    "You." She grabs your throat with both hands. "Tell." She gently lifts you up against the door. "NO ONE."

    *Squeak* "Okay!" And she lets you down. "Seriously, though.. I mean.. does your mom or dad live here with you?"

    *Darkly* "I don't have any parents." She crosses her arms, and sits on the bed.

    *Stunned* "What..?" You're completely blown away. No parents? "Did.. they die, or something..? Don't you have any other relatives? Anyone to take care of you?"

    "I don't NEED anyone to take care of me!" She shoots back. "And.. it's.. it's complicated.." She hugs herself and seems to retreat into a little ball.

    "Sunset.. I.. I had no idea.." You set your backpack and laptop case down, and shake your head. Geeze.. no one!? "..how long have you been on your own like this?"

    "It doesn't matter." She snorted. "Are we going to get to work, or what?" She cocked a brow at you.

    "W-Well.. would you mind running over to Burger Barn?" You hold up a twenty.

    *Tch* "Fine." She gets up and snatches it.

    "Get whatever you want. I just want a Number 7 with no cheese." You shrug.

    "Ew. Yeah. The cheese is horrible." She sneers a little. "Yeah.. that it?"

    "That's it. Whatever's left, get whatever you want." You shrug.

    "Alright.." She grabs her jacket and departs. Burger Barn wasn't that far away.

    Now, you were fucking curious. With her gone, you go through what little she has there, trying to find out anything you can about her. You come across.. a book. With a horse's head on it. Inside are pictures.. interesting pictures.. of a weird-looking horse that has Sunset's hairdo and hair colors, and a big white one with a multi-colored mane that looks.. like it's 3D or some shit. And jewelry. Odd jewelry.

    What.. in the sweet fuck..

    You took too long going through the pictures, and she got back a bit sooner than you were expecting..

    "They almost got your order wrong an-HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING GOING THROUGH MY STUFF!?" She screams at the top of her lungs.

    "..Sunset.. what is this?" You hold up the album. "What's these weird looking horses? And why does one of them look like you? What's all this stuff written beneath the pictures?" You sit back a little. "Sunset.."

    "I-It's none of your damn business!" She stammers and grabs the book from you.

    "Sunset.. level with me.." You stand up. "..that horse looks like you. It even has your facial expressions. And it doesn't look like any horse I've ever seen - it looks like something out of a cartoon. And this isn't something that looks like CG. These pictures.. look like old Kodak instant photos." You weren't just weirded out, you were nearly shaking. "Are you even hu-"

    "Don't you dare finish that question!" She got right up in your face. But carefully set the food down on the table. "DON'T YOU EVER ASK!"

    "I'm asking. Because my next step is calling my uncle - he's in the FBI. Works missing persons cases." Which is true. He was basically like Hotchner from Criminal Minds, but with more than a wooden personality. "You have no parents.. you're, what, 15?" A fist on your hip. "How the hell did you even get into the school!?" Your other hand flies up in question. "I want the truth!"

    "YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!" She looked ready to rip your face off.

    "Look.. I promise I won't tell anyone.. but I have to know. WHAT.. are you?" Your hands out, almost flapping to your sides.

    "It's.." She sits on the bed. "..you PROMISE you won't tell anyone?"

    "My word." You nod.

    "I'm.. basically.. from another plane of existence. Everyone there are.. ponies. I was one, too." She looks at the album. "I was a student of.. she's basically a goddess.."

    "She looks a bit like Principal Celestia.." You put in.

    "She IS Principal Celestia.. rather.. she's Princess Celestia. Like.. Goddess of the Sun." She shook her head.

    "Stupid human holidays." You remember the library. "The book from the library - I was on the other side of the stack, studying. You're.. not really human, then?" A head tilt. This was a LOT to take in.

    "Y-You heard that..?" She stitches her brows together in humiliation. *Sigh* "I can't go back there. Ever. Before you came to the school, I had.. my arch-nemesis kicked my ass. Long story. But.. she.. I did some things, and.. Princess Celestia... I just can't go back where I came from! I'm STUCK here. Trying to survive here." She looked at the apartment. "I had some decent cash to start with. We use metal money over there, and I sold off the coins for their gold value.. but.. I lost all that. I lost basically everything but this." She flapped her arms. "And my car. Which is broken. And I can't afford to get the replacement parts for it, so I'm going to have to sell it and hope I can find something that runs." She hugged herself again. "Some Christmas... this is why I hate stupid human holidays." She flopped her ass on the bed. "They just remind me of what I messed up. They remind me.. what kind of a failure I am. How worthless I am." She was practically curled up in a ball, hiding her face from you.

    But you saw the tears drop onto the carpetless wood floor.

    "Oh.. Sunset.." You sit next to her.. and whether she wanted it or not, you hug her. She resisted at first, she tried to free her arms and slug you.. but you held her. "I'm shocked you haven't just given up, yet." She cried for a few minutes.. just.. sobbing softly into her hands, while you held on to her from behind.

    Finally, however, she lifted her head.

    "Because I refuse to let that purple bitch WIN!" She spat out. "I'm going to make it here. I'm going to make my life here better than anything she could ever have over there! I'm going to be SUCCESSFUL.. RICH.. POWERFUL.. and SHE can ROT in TARTARUS!" She frustratedly pulled at her hands, locking her fingers together, and almost drawing blood with her fingernails.

    "Wealth isn't everything." You shrug. "My folks are pretty well off - you saw that - but they work so much.." A sigh. "..they don't even really NEED to, they just do. My dad told me that, well, since I'm not into sports or anything, he doesn't have to worry about missing any ball games." You shrug. "Same with my mom. I mean, we could get by real well on just one of their salaries.. but they both work. At least my mom works from home most of the time. But then they have these drinking parties.." A head-shake. "..they get liquored up and pass out. Dad and I were supposed to work on some miniatures today, for a game once Winter Break hits.." You purse your lips together. "..I guess, you know, at least I have parents. Even if they don't make much time for me. At least they're there for me when I really need them." You rub her shoulders.

    "Yeah. That's better than nothing, I suppose.. and what do you mean 'money isn't everything'?" She finally turned to look at you, her eyes all puffy and reddened.

    "Exactly what I said. My folks have a dream of buying a house boat in Florida for retirement after I go off to college or trade school. And all they do is worry about their money. Sure, they get me things, whatever, that's fine.. but they're not THERE for me. Not like it used to be when I was a kid. They.. we did so much stuff together back then. I was really happy. Now...?" You shrug. "We hardly do anything as a family any more. No, money's everything, Sunset. It's important, yeah, but.." You purse your lips again, almost gritting them together. "..family's better. Friends are better. I had friends, once. Kids I grew up with. But my dad wanted to move here for more business opportunities. They.. told me I'd just make new friends. Like my opinion didn't matter."

    "So.. I screwed up my own life, and your parents screwed up yours.." She shrugged. "Gee.. what a pair we are."

    "That's what I mean, though.. I don't want to be rich and famous.. I just want to make sure any kids I have, are happy. That we do things together. As a Family." You shrug again. "Money can't buy love, it can't buy happiness.. you just THINK you're happy.. when all you really have are things. Things can't love you back." You give her a little smile.

    "..I guess you're right.." She looks away a little.

    "Does that purple girl have a family? Friends? Real friends that would kill for her and help her bury a body? Kids? A husband? Anything like that?" You ask, tilting your head.

    "I think she has friends in the other world. I don't think she's married, though." She shrugs.

    "Then find a guy, start a family, and make her jealous of your kids, your family.. and a loving husband. Or-Or wife. You know." You shrug. No reason to be discriminatory.

    "Maybe.. you're right.." She looked at the ground. She sighed. "Can we eat, now? I'm starving."

    "Emotional displays tend to do that." You nod.

    So, you ate. And you worked on the oral report part of things well into the night. When you noticed it was about midnight - and you both had to be up in the morning for school - you had to stop her.

    "Shit.. uhm.. I got a bit of a problem." A frown.

    "What?!" She seemed.. a bit taken aback.

    "The headlights on my car are out. I'm.. I can't legally drive it at night." A sheepish grin.

    "Well.. isn't that lovely." She crossed her arms. "Fine. Whatever. You already know the truth about me.."

    "You know, it's not like anyone would ever believe me.." You start.

    "..which is the only reason you're still alive." She puts in. "No, fine.. you can stay here. Are your parents going to care?"

    "They're probably passed out by now." You shrug. "I got all my school books and stuff in my bag."

    "Just a second." She gets up and walks to the dresser, pulling out a pair of loose pants. "I got these from one of those charity places. They don't fit." They're 5XL. No wonder. She's maybe an S. "Put these on. But so help me, if you DARE touch me.." She glared at you.

    "We cool! We cool!" You throw up your hands in surrender, and go borrow her bathroom, coming out in your wifebeater and those ultra-loose pants. You.. made sure to tie them up real tight.. yeah.
    "Alright. You get THAT side of the bed. And stay on your side." She snorted a little. Of course, her side was closest to the steam-based heater. Which, of course, was one of those broke-ass pieces of shit that was either too hot or too cold.

    And only one blanket.

    So, under the covers you go, making sure to grab your jacket, just in case, and getting as comfortable as possible.

    Keeping in mind that there's Sunset..

    ..in bed..

    ..with you.

    God Damn It, Boner! PLEASE! Not tonight of all nights!

    Your boner ignores your pleas for mercy..

    ..a very stiff, uncomfortable night.

    Oh, and things only get worse when Sunset violates her own provisions.

    And rolls over..

    ..and drapes her arm over you..

    ..fuck. And you're sharing a blanket?

    You will die before Christmas, you swear. Unless you can wriggle out?

    Nope. No go. She's too close to you.

    Where is her hand going?!

    No, please, God, not there..

    She ran her hand over it, but she was a very sound sleeper.

    Suddenly, you can feel it get stroked. The Leviathan had slipped out of the front hole of your boxers and was resting against the soft material of these pants..

    ..and she's now stroking it gently.

    Ooohhhh.. fuck your teenage hormones! This feels so.. so good.. never mind being a virgin..

    You lay there uncomfortably for a few minutes while Sunset gently moans in her sleep, while stroking your dick - made of pure diamonds at the moment - through those pants. Soft.. soft pants..

    Finally, you work up the courage to say something - the fear of her cutting them off overloading the desire of your dick to see fruition of her casual efforts.

    "S-Sunset..?" You were on the very edge of the bed. The VERY edge..

    No vocal response.. but she does stroke a little harder. Urrhh.. so good..

    "SUNSET!" You finally say out loud, your breath choking up in your throat.

    "Uhh.. huh?" Her hand grasped the object that it had been gently toying with.. "UH!" And she realized what it was. "ANON!"

    "It's not my fault that you're hot! Or that you were giving me a handy in your sleep!" She's still holding it, so, you can't escape.

    "I was..?" She looks down - the neon glow of a sign across the street giving her ample light to look at her work. "Oh.. oh, crap.. I.." She looked at you, then looked down at herself.

    You catch a whiff when the blankets moved aside. Girl was soaked.

    "Oh, gawd.." She releases your dick, finally, and curls herself up into a little ball. "I-I.. oh.. GAWD.." She's completely humiliated. "I didn't mean.. to.. I mean.. I was.." She stammers.

    "Must've been one HECK of a dream.." You can't scoot anywhere but the floor, but you get your legs up to cover your shame.

    "Let's just say.. he was someone I knew about.. very big, strong.." She looked away. "..this happens to me, a lot. My dreams are very vivid. I.. usually don't.. sleep with clothes on because of it." She also curls up into a little ball, hugging her knees. "..now my fucking cunt aches.." She mutters. "..didn't finish.."

    "How do you think I feel?" You finally get up, and walk to the bathroom. "I'll be out in a minute."

    Yeah, it don't take much to finish. Thing is, she decides to finish herself off while you're busy. And you can hear it. And she's a vocal one, she is. And that makes it hotter. And that makes you fap TWICE.


    Neither of you ever admitted to that as you went to school that day. Or the next day. Or any other day leading up to Christmas/Winter Break. Actually, your parents didn't even notice you were gone the whole night.
    But, you decide, over the course of the next few days, that Sunset - despite being a bitch, a tease in her sleep, and a bully to you when her grades aren't on the line - deserved a Christmas. Something. No one deserved to be all alone.

    Not even your worst enemy.

    In secret, sort of, you get to the mall and buy her a few things with your pocket money (you've outright stopped taking lunch money to school at this point - you and Sunset meet in the library at lunch, but stop at your locker for something to eat, first). Something special, too.

    A little bracelet you can stick little dangly things on, and a small unicorn with a red and yellow gem in it. Cheap stuff - it was steel or something - and it cost about $12 total. You also got her a few other things - stuff she needed. A blanket that was nearly-new that your parents stuffed in the attic because it no longer matched anything, some sheets that didn't match anything, either, two packs of socks from Walleye-Mart, and a bunch of your mom's pre-pregnancy clothes (jeans, wifebeaters with prints on them, shit like that) that she'd never wear again that all looked "retro" in the cool way..

    In total, you had five large packages for her.

    You even wrapped them.

    Christmas Break hit, and she picked up some extra shifts at work. You still had Thursday afternoons and Sundays scheduled for her. Christmas Eve landed on a Thursday. The Monday immediately before hand, though, your parents inform you that your maternal grandfather (who you met exactly once, because he lives in Montana) has taken to his death bed, and they want to spend Christmas with him.

    They won't be back until after he passes on, and the funeral is handled, so.. they hand you a few hundred bucks cash, the emergency credit card, tell you not to open your presents until they get back (they promise a make-up Christmas - since you didn't believe in Santa any more, they don't see the harm in it), and leave.

    Actually, this works out in your favor!

    Sunset was going to see that, even though you were a total outcast, a nerd, and probably the worst social example of someone to be seen with, you actually GAVE A FUCK about her. This wasn't even romantic. This was just you trying to be a friend. She sure seemed like she needed one..


    Thus, it came to be, that you invited her over on that Thursday..


    "Aren't you.. having Christmas with your parents?" She asked, over the phone.

    "No, my granpda's dying, they went to Montana to see him off and stick around for the Will reading. They won't be back until around New Year's. So, why don't you come over?" Innocent enough.

    "..I suppose." She sniffed haughtily over the phone. "Nothin' better to do - the mall's closed."

    "That and the central heater in the building went out last night, so, it's damned cold over here.."

    You remember that all she really has is that blanket. Well, not soon, but still..

    "Yeah, come on over. I'll cook us dinner, even." Traditional Christmas Dinner. You had all the fixins, and you were good enough at cooking to pull this off.

    By the time she showed up, you had dinner almost done. Instead of cooking the giant "family" turkey (yes, your family has Turkey for Christmas), you cooked a smaller one that was in the fridge. Mashed potatoes, green beans, dinner rolls, sweet potato pie, and cranberry sauce. You opened the door once she knocked, and let her in. You even had the table set.

    "Dinner's almost ready. Have a seat." You smirk and saunter off into the kitchen.

    "It.. smells.. REALLY good.." She's stunned at the display, but comes in and gets her boots, jacket, and top shirt off. "..I got that 'new' car, finally. The shop had one they traded me for. At least it runs.." She shrugged.

    Out comes dinner, right as she sits down. You finally have an excuse to use that rolling server your mom keeps in the cubby hole. Everything is on it.

    "Oh..wow.." Her jaw practically hits the table. "..really, Anon?!" She blinks at you.

    "Traditional Christmas Dinner. Sort of. Some families have Ham. We've always had Turkey." You shrug. "No one deserves to be alone on Christmas." And offer her a smile.

    Her eyes mist up a little as you serve her. It's just the two of you, so you dig right on in.

    "We had.. something.. kinda.. a bit like this.." She didn't go into details. "..thank you, Anon.." She blushed a bit. "..maybe you're not such a geekazoid, after all." She even offers you a genuine grin!

    "I'm not done yet." You tell her, now that your dinner is all finished. "We're almost done with everything in the project - I just need to paint a couple more figurines."

    "Then you invited me over just for dinner?" She tilts her head at you. "That's.. sweet."

    "No, no, no.. there's more. Come here." You take her hand and guide her into the Den, where the Christmas Tree was set up. Your mother always went insane with the decorations. The Den looks like it was made for Christmas.

    "Ooohhh.." Her eyes full of wonder, she lets you guide her to the tree.

    "I.. uh.. I got you something.." You shrug, and kneel down, pulling out her boxes from under the tree. "..like I said, no one deserves to be alone on Christmas." You offer her a sheepish grin.

    "Anon..!" She's taken aback, rolling to sit on her legs as she accepts the wrapped boxes.

    "Open them." You nod.

    She opens the first box - the pants - taking out each article of clothing one at a time and looking them over. A twisted, child-like, almost sad smile across her face the whole time.

    Then she tears into the second. The shirts and tops. These, she actually tries on, her face growing flushed as she looks at them on her body.

    The third. Her new blanket. She gasps a little, pulling it out, and hugging it to herself, her hard exterior almost completely washed away by the warm, cozy feeling of the blanket.

    Number four. Socks! She squeals a little, seeing that one package is fuzzy socks! She even rubs those against her cheek.

    The fifth.. this was a new pair of house shoes. Soft, and warm, she's teared up at seeing them.

    "I have one more thing for you." You say, pulling it from its hidden perch.

    "Anon.. you.." She starts, her voice choked up. "..didn't have to do this." Her lip is like jelly, quivering on her face.

    Finally, you hand her the last box. She takes it, and opens it.. looks at the contents.. looks at you.. and start crying.

    Hard.

    "Oh... shit... I'm sorry.." You sink back a little. "I-I didn't mean t-"

    You're hugged. Tightly. She just sobs into your shoulder for a bit, clinging to you like the only solid object amidst a sea of turbulence, holding on for dear life.

    "Th-Th-Thank y-you..." She finally stammers out. "I've.." She looks into your eyes. "..I've never been so happy."

    "..and the fire is so delightful.." you hear the sound system in the background. Ol' Blue Eyes.

    You smile, once she pulls back. "Can the purple girl say her friends would do something like this for her?" Your smile becomes a conspiratorial smirk.

    "No.. Nonny.." She trails off. "..and they wouldn't get this from her." She KISSED YOU ON THE LIPS.

    Sweet Jesus those are warm, soft, comfortable lips. She holds the kiss for almost a full minute before pulling back.

    *Ahem* "S-Sorry.." She blushed deeply. "Just.. no one's ever.. cared like this before.. I didn't think you'd.. you know.. even want to be around me, after you found out the truth.."

    "I care about you." Your head is still swimming from that kiss. "I don't care that you were born in a world of horses. You're HERE now.. and.. I'd like to think of you as my friend." A shrug.

    "Thank you, Nonny.. that.." She wipes her eyes. "..it means more to me than you can imagine."

    "I have some idea." A grin.

    "We interrupt this broadcast for a bulletin from the National Weather Service." The music cuts out. "A severe winter storm has moved into this state, causing up to ten inches of snow to fall in just a couple of hours. Up to twenty four inches are predicted to fall over the next twelve hours, and up to an additional twelve to fourteen inches in the twenty four hours after that. All state highways have been officially shut down. The Governor has officially requested that the White House declare a federal state of emergency, but until that time, the Governor has declared a state of emergency for all counties affected by the storm. National Guard units will be called on as soon as possible to provide relief and assistance in clearing snow, and rescuing people trapped by the blizzard. The Governor has asked those in affected areas not to leave their homes for any reason except dire emergency.."

    You click the radio off. Right as the power went out.

    "Well.. fuck."

    "Anon.. I don't think I'm going to be getting home tonight." She says, rather matter-of-factly. "Is your heat electric?"

    "Nope, gas. Dad's.. eh.. one of those preppers." You shrug, not that you weren't grateful for it at this very moment. "The pilot light for the heater's even non-electric. Just in case. Dad also had a huge gas storage tank buried in the back yard, so, we're good for a few days even if the gas gets shut off."

    "Okay, then.. looks like I'm stuck with you." She shrugged. "Got something for light?"

    "Stay here." Your family DID - despite its failings - have an emergency plan for things like this shit. First step? Flashlights. There were plug-in emergency lights all over the house (except the den, because of the decorations), so you went and fetched one, and got back over to her. "Come on, we have an emergency plan just in case this sort of thing happens."

    "Alright." She followed as you ran through your list.

    Step Two: Water. The pipes will freeze sooner or later, so you take the step of filling the three bathtubs in the house with emergency water, and getting the containers of water out of storage in the basement.
    Step Three: Heat. You check the furnace, and make sure that the buried gas tank can be switched over to without a problem.
    Step Four: Food. That.. that you didn't have to worry about, so much. Your back porch was a covered affair with the porch itself elevated off the ground by a couple feet. The porch roof was specifically angled to deflect as much snow as possible, so you just set all the goodies out on the back porch, and covered them with a shovel or two of snow. The snow itself was almost to the top step of the porch.. meaning it was almost shoulder-deep.
    Step Five: Home Defense. Your dad had guns - hunting rifles, shotguns, and a few handguns - in a cabinet in his office. The main arsenal was under biometric lock-and-key in a hidden safe in your parent's bedroom. You did have a bypass password, but there was no sense in going for the heavy artillery. You did unlock the cabinet, load up the Mossberg, his 1911, and your favorite rife (a Carcano cavalry carbine - soft shooting, and comfy, it's been yours since you were 10). They'd be going in your room with you. Given the weather, you doubt there'll be looters.. but.. just in case, and all.

    "Is that everything?" She finally asks, with the two of you in your room.

    "Yep, that's the important stuff." You set the 1911 on your desk, with the Carcano, and the Mossberg next to it. Safeties ALL on. "Give me a sec, I'll get out my sleeping bag and air mattress.."

    "O-Oh.." She's a bit surprised at that.

    "I'll sleep on them, you can have the bed." You give her a bit of a nod as you dig in your closet.

    "Well.. the bed is.." She runs her hands over it. "..you don't have to."

    "I don't mind." You shrug, pulling out the sleeping bag. Fucker was WARM.. and COZY.. and-

    "No, I mean.." She grabs your hand and pulls you on to the bed with her. "..you don't have to sleep alone."

    Your heart shoots to your throat as she runs a hand along your thigh. You can feel your girth get rock solid in moments.

    "You don't.." You start, not wanting her to feel like she has to give it up to you in exchange for your kindness.

    "Shh." She kisses you again. But this isn't a kiss of thanks. "You made me happy today.." She shrugged. "..really happy.." She looked at the bracelet. "..I'm not doing this because I feel indebted or anything."
    "Sunset.. I.." You try to back off. You didn't want.. okay, so, you can't admit you weren't curious, but still. You didn't want something to happen like THIS..

    "Non.." She narrows her eyes at you. "..shut up and hold still. I'm going to shatter your world." She reaches out, and grasps your jeans, popping the button at the top and unzipping them.

    You no longer have the will to resist, as the fully erect leviathan is pulled out from your boxers.

    "Geeze, Anon!" She says, looking it over. "That thing'll never fit in a condom.." She mutters, gently caressing it.

    Okay, you're a bit on the large side, but honestly, you saw it more as a curse than a blessing. It was, indeed, too large for any condom you tried. The problem is the shape and thickness - its oval-shaped, and almost three inches across at its thickest point. Length? Length was about average - a bit over six, to maybe six and a half on a good day (like now) - but it was the girth..

    "..oh, well. I think it'll fit here.." She says, getting on her knees, and gently kissing the base of the shaft.

    Her tongue gently slides out from between those warm, soft lips, and it proves to be even warmer and softer.. almost silky.. as it traces a gentle line from the very base of the shaft, to the tip.. and the second her mouth goes over it.. and she MOANS along the length.. you grunt, and practically lose control of yourself, sliding against the edge of your desk.

    She uses this as a chance to get your pants all the way down, and off, leaving you in boxers and your wifebeater.

    She SLURPS your cock into her mouth - she's got just enough room to get it all in without deep throating - and greedily sucks along it, her tongue slithering along the base, until she pulls out almost all the way, so that her lips are around just the tip.. then her tongue lashes over the head of your rock-hard shaft.. before she goes down again, giving another long moan. Her hands slide around to your ass.. your ASS.. and start massaging your cheeks, the fingertips rubbing all those muscles there, encouraging you to relax and take it..

    ..and with her working the shaft like she is, you're practically fainting, your head awash in endorphins.. you moan, loudly, your eyelids mostly shut.

    The suckling stops a moment, and she stands up. You open your eyes to see that she's already removed her panties - they're soaked again - and tossed them to the side. Taking this as a hint, you gently push her on to your bed. She offers no resistance.. instead, hiking up her skirt and spreading her legs.

    "Do it." She almost-demands.

    You have no trouble lining up your shot as she pulls off your boxers with her toes, her shirt and your top off with her hands. With a gentle push, Anon Jr goes spelunking into the (surprisingly virginal, but not-anaconda-tight) pink cavern of the hot, shimmering Sunset.

    With a PULL, however, she sinks you DEEP inside of her and you can feel she didn't have a hymen (you did see something next to the bed the first night, but you had ignored it). She was tight, but not TOO tight.. dear GOD it felt like you just sank your dick into liquid silk.

    *Hnngghh!* She squeals a little. "Rough.. I like.. it rough.." She stammers out.

    And you oblige her request, almost on instinct, pounding her nice, tight pussy as hard as you can, her skirt ridden up all the way to her hips. She fumbles with the side zipper, finally freeing herself from this last strip of cloth, and embracing you fully, hands behind your neck..

    Your bed holds up to this abuse very well, though your mattress is giving in to your pounding thrusts. She pulls you into a passionate kiss.. letting her legs snake around your ass, and riding every thrust as you make her squeal and moan.. You SWEAR you can feel her G-Spot rubbing against the bottom of your shaft with every thrust.. it's surprisingly shallow.. so, you grind into it. THAT made her scream..

    *AHGN!*AH!*HAAH*UUHH*AAHHHH!* The sounds going off in your ear only make you want to fuck her harder.

    And you do, your thrusts increasing in tempo and harshness until you can feel her vaginal walls quiver.. then spasm.. then..

    *AHHHHHHHHAHNNNNNNNNNNNNNGHHH* She tenses up like a question mark..

    ..and you absolutely blow your load deep inside. Her arms around you, you just sink into her.. pumping out pulse after pulse of white, hot, pent-up lust.

    The two of you pass out in your little embrace. Though that's not the end of things. Remember, this girl has hot-ass dreams.  And you wake up to her cuddling you.. stroking your dick.. and you can, now, run a hand over her netherlips and feel that she's completely soaked. Again.

    A little grin curls up on the edges of your mouth. 'Why the FUCK not?' Your Dick asks your Brain. 'Can't argue with that, Boner.' Your Brain replies.

    So, you gently roll over on top of her again, and slip it in with ease. She's more than accepting of this.. and though still asleep.. she lazily entwines herself with you, again. Once AGAIN you pound that tight pussy.. and in her sleep, she seems capable of multiple, quick orgasms.. which you greedily feed her..

    ..your cock is thrusting in and out of her, you nearing your own climax again..

    ..when she finally wakes up.

    "A-A-AHNON..Y..MOUS.." She squeals so cutely as you blow a second load inside her. "Hnngghh.." She lolls her head back. "..so, so good.." Her eyes shut.

    "That.. was kinky.." You rest your head on her shoulder/your pillow.

    "..it's kinda.. hnn.. like.. a secret.. fetish of mine.." She looks over at you, too tired to do much else.

    "So.. can I rape you in your sleep from now on?" A half grin.

    "..gawd, that's so hot.." She lolls her head back a little. "Don't tell anyone." She begs.

    "My lips are sealed." You run a hand over her chest and gently play with her nipples, which just makes her squirm more..

    *Hngh!* "S-Stop.. I'm getting.. like.. mega aftershocks.." She scoots around a little..

    Which just causes you to slide your hand down and massage her clit as she rolls away from you. Your other hand - under her - is still latched on to her tit.

    "S-Ss..fuuck.." She gives up. *Hnghgh* And melts into your fingers.

    Despite the gentle ache in your balls, you still have the strength for one final act of debauchery. So, you gently lift her leg and.. poke at her back door.

    "Hnnnn.." She whine/moans so cutely, but doesn't say stop.

    So, in you go.. already slickened up from her cunt, both your pole and her back door hole don't need much else for you to get it inside of her. And in you go..

    *GUHHHHHHSSSSSSSP!* "A-AHHH-HAHHHHnnnnnngh!" She's too stupefied for words.

    ...your fingers continue to work over her twice-fucked cunt, your seed so mixed with her juices that you can't tell one from the other. Your fingers play along her magic bean.. toy with getting inside of her.. while your diamond drill dick starts fucking her ass like a jackhammer.. so tight.. so WARM.. Her eyes are in the back of her head at this point.. and she throws two HARD orgasms back-to-back.. her fingers digging in to your arm, as she's thrown into her own sea of hormones and endorphins. It's more than enough to make you blow that one final load.. DEEP in her ass.. balls-deep, to be precise..

    The two of you spent the next four days together. Oh, you finished the project alright.. but you spent a LOT of time fucking each other's brains out in every room in the house.

    Every room.

    Even the Attic.

    Even the Basement.

    Even in your parent's bed.


    The day of the report finally rolls around, and the two of you pull it off expertly, the diorama a total hit.

    "..and that's why the Battle of Marston Moor was as important as it was to the English Civil War.." She concludes.

    Applause. Thunderous applause. Even from Mr. Turner.

    "Excellent job, Anon and Sunset." He nods. "Are you okay, Sunset? You look a little queasy.."

    *Urp* "Uh.. excuse me.." And off she runs to the bathroom.

    You just give her a quizzical look before reality sets in.

    You know, the reality where you realize that you've been fucking her like a machine, without protection, regularly, for the last week or so?

    A+ on the report, by the way..
