Part 1: Thick, Sticky Layers

TIME: 08:53 ERST
DATE: War Day 877/1 Noneus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Royal Palace, Canterlot

After a week, I was intentionally moved to Canterlot both for my own safety, and so I could recover basking in the magical aura of both Princesses. I had to admit, it actually did help. Applejack and my kids were all here, too. Ponyville was on extra alert, trying to find out how that assassination team got so close.

Despite the magi-injury, and the aches (which were getting lighter by the day), I still had physical energy. I needed to get up and walk. Dr. Whooves told me this was natural, that because of the "magi-damage" to my body, my muscles would feel itchy and restless until I was fully healed. He warned me, given the level of injury I sustained, this could take a long time.

I walked into the kitchen, wanting to make breakfast myself, despite Hekkon, the Griffin Chef, wanting to practically nurse-maid me with his (admittedly excellent) food.

What I found was Celestia.. stuffing cake into her mouth.

K: "Cel?" I cocked a brow, and approached.

Celestia: "Eh!?" She was taken completely by surprise.. and I realized she'd been eating like a savage - there was cake all over her mouth, and she was stuffing it into her pie hole with both hooves. "Oh! K!" She hid her face with her wings. "Pl.. please.. don't.. don't look at me!"

I could see the teardrops hit the floor.

I immediately moved over to her, slid to my knees, and held her closely to me.

K: "They're alive, Cel." I knew what she was feeling.. I just.. knew. "We're alive. We made it. The dead are dead, but the living are living. And because we had all the right things, we've saved so many lives.." I stroked her (flat, horsehair, NOT astral) mane.

She just sobbed, and kept stuffing.

Celestia: "Don't.. deserve.. I should be FAT and DISGUSTING! On the OUTSIDE like.."

I grabbed her forelegs, and forced them away from the cake.

K: "No. Don't." I shook my head. "Look at me, Cel." I pulled her towards me.

Celestia: "I WAS HORRIBLE! I was a MONSTER inside!" She shrieked. "I.. I was so scared.. you'd find out the truth.. that.. that you'd kill me.. for it." She couldn't bring herself to hug me. "I should look like I was.. I don't.. deserve.."

K: "Cel.. I know.. I know I knew the truth. I just didn't care. Honest? From what little I remember, I may have seen you as better than Tirek. But.. I.. don't think I trusted you." I grabbed her muzzle, and made her look me in the eyes. "But, that was not ME-me. This me. The real me. *I* trust you." I forced her to hug me. "I trust you, and I care for you in a way I can't put into words. You called yourself their mom. I'm Dad. I know it, I feel it, with every order I issue.. we aren't married, but we ARE their parents." I pulled her in tightly. "You. And me. Us. Not whoever those two were."

She just cried. And cried.

I was amazed she held it in as long as she had. She remembered EVERYTHING about the other timeline. Everything. And she saw the despot she'd become.. her worst fear come to life.. and it reviled, repulsed, and disgusted her. She was absolutely, completely, disgusted with her own self.

So.. she ate. She ate something she felt would make her fat and disgusting on the outside, the way she felt about herself on the inside.

I had stopped her.

And she had cried.

TIME: 10:37 ERST

K: "..and I want it made absolutely clear that she's not to be brought any cake whatsoever." I nodded to Ironhide and Flash.

Ironhide: "We understand." He shrugged. "She has petitioners again, today."

K: "Call in a Code Salmon Pink Lace to the Crystal Kingdom. As for the Petitioners, go in there and see if any case absolutely must be seen today - life or death - and schedule them after lunch. Anyone else that can wait, waits until at least tomorrow. Make sure they have Lodgings." I nodded to him.

Ironhide: "And who shall see the Petitioners?" He shrugged.

K: "Myself and Twilight Sparkle." I nodded back to him.

Flash: "Twilight?!" He was a bit worried.

K: "Yes. She's going to be Prime Minister once the war is over. It's time she got some experience." I shrugged. "Besides, I'm now operating with Celestia's personal authority. And get Forest Spirit in here - I'm still technically relieved of duty as Commander-in-Chief and NEIGHTO SAC."

Ironhide: "Right away." He nodded, and headed off.

K: "Come on, Flash. You need to Triage the Petitioners. I'll be in the Throne Room." I shrugged, and headed that way.

Once inside, Misty was there, and came up to me, casually saluting.

Misty: "General." She nodded. "I heard you'll be taking charge for the day?"

K: "The hell are you even doing awake!?" I chuckled a bit.

Misty: "I was about to bed down, sir, and.." She looked to the side. "..ever since Nightmare Night, I realized I need to do more." She nodded, and looked right at me.

Raven Inkwell: "General K!" She trotted up, with papers stuffed in a saddle bag. "Oh.. uh.." She shrugged. "Misty, right?"

Misty: "Yes. Raven?" She pointed at her.

Raven Inkwell: "Yes, yes.. ah.. General.." She started shuffling through papers. "..we.. we have some more information on the Sultanate of Orghuz. The General you captured was more forthcoming after some time on Carousel Island." She shrugged. "He's wanting.. well.. VIP accomodations."

K: "I bet he is!" I smirked. "What's he willing to trade?"

Raven Inkwell: "Probably a lot.. he said he's grown weary of the boring food, and.." She flipped to a page. "..Infidel company."

K: "VERY interesting that he'd use THAT term.." I frowned. "..and troubling."

Raven Inkwell: "Y-Well.." She shrugged. "..I-I have more here."

K: "I bet. Raven, you're always so high strung." I pat her shoulder. "Take a deep breath.. and relax."

She started to inhale slowly, and-

Flash Sentry: "GENERAL K!"

Raven Inkwell: "YEEEEEEEEEEIKE!" She flew almost to the ceiling, which is amazing, since she's a Unicorn, not a Pegasus.

I got up immediately, and caught Raven in my arms as she landed.

K: "What is it, Flash?"

Flash Sentry: "An Ambassdor from Orghuz is.." He shook his head. "..he's passing through Ponyville right now. Twilight is with him."

K: "Oh, holy-fucking-shit.. what a time for Celestia to be on the brain-fritz!" I looked down at Raven, who was having a mild panic attack, panting like a worn-out dog, her eyes as tiny as periods, and sweat coming from her brow. "Settle, girl! Settle!" She clung to me, shaking. "All stressed out." I shook my head, looking back at Flash. "How long?"

Flash Sentry: "About an hour." He shrugged. "Y'they're on some kind of motor vehicle. Twilight wasn't specific."

K: "Mm." I nodded, petting Raven's mane, holding her over my shoulder. "Can I set you down, and you not faint, Raven?" I asked her.

Raven: "I-I.. y-yes. Sir." She was still shaking, but I did just that, and nodded to Misty to get her out of here.

K: "Alright.." I nodded to Ironhide as he came in. "ETA on Cadence?"

Ironhide: "Noon, sir." He nodded. "What's up?"

K: "Ambassador from Orghuz. Alert the NEIGHTO partners. I want representatives here as fast as we can get them." I nodded.

Ironhide: "Mmm.." He frowned a bit. "..I see. Well, I know King Solarenski is supposed to be here tomorrow.. I'll check and see how he's arriving and if we can expedite. Anyone else would be a couple days, at least."

K: "DO it." I nodded. "And get Hekkon to make some lunch with lamb, rice, chicken, and grains. No pork, no matter what." I nodded.

Ironhide: "On it." And off he went.

I paced a bit, and decided to go get my formal uniform on. Applejack and the kids were in my Palace room, with the girls talking, Rolfe studying, and Koringo playing with her dolls. The babies were in the crib.

I went over and picked up Arthur, and gave him a huggle, then Liberty.

K: "Honey, get your formal uniform on. Girls? Stay in here. We're about to have a diplomatic issue. I wouldn't want anything to happen - and you know our record." I nodded to them, grabbing my formal Summer uniform jacket - it was cut like a military tunic, unlike the warmer Ike Jacket. Short-sleeve shirt underneath, necktie, pistol belt.

Applejack got dressed as well.

Rolfe: "Oh, we got this, Dad." He smiled a bit.

K: "Good. If you hear shooting, get out." I nodded to the windows.

Florale: "We shall grab zee babies and get to safety, PaPa." She smirked.

K: "Alright.. alright, honey, ready?" I nodded to her.

Applejack: "Ain't likin' this." She frowned. "Where's Princess Celestia?"

K: "Down." I raised my brows.

I didn't see it, but Rolfe dug in the desk he was seated at, and made sure his Lee pistol was ready.

We went back to the Throne Room.

Raven Inkwell: "Ah! Mrs. K---!" She nodded. "Oh, K! They'll be here, soon. And.." She shook her head. "..something else strange. We just got a report from the Border Guards at Lubec, Maine. A party from an unknown nation passed through there two days ago. No other information available, other than they had a NEIGHTO introduction letter and passage certificate from Poleland."

K: "Oh, LOVELY! They'll be here.. any time now." I frowned.

Raven Inkwell: "Well.. Twilight will be here.. very soon. AAhh.. do.. you need me?" She frowned.

K: "Get a sportcoat on - you're Secretary of State." I frowned.

I should point out, she was quite qualified for the role. No one knew more about what was going on in Equestria both in large and small writ than Raven. She was Celestia's governmental aide. She'd been in the background since before the war began, running information from one end of the Kingdom to the other, to Celestia's ear. Or, mine.

Raven Inkwell: "I-" She looked like a stunned goat.

Applejack: "Yew herd him! Git presentable, Raven!" She smiled, and rushed her off.

[End of Part 1]

Part 2: Breaking Bread with Seven Devils

TIME: 11:13 ERST
DATE: War Day 877/1 Noneus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Royal Palace, Canterlot


The three of us waited in the Throne Room. None of us sat on the Throne itself. Raven was sporting a soft lavender sport coat and a skirt that matched, with flats. Applejack was in her General Staff uniform. I was in my Summer Formals.

We could hear the Ambassador's party approaching from the outer corridor.

Twilight: "..and I'm SURE we can solve this situation, Mister Ambassador." She said, as the guards opened the door.

Thankfully, she was wearing a subdued blouse and skirt today.

K: "Madame Prime Minister." I addressed her.

Twilight: "AH?!" She was a bit stunned, but quickly rolled with it. "Ah, yes. General K---." She nodded to me. "Allow me to introduce Ambassador Afasil Hasan." She nodded to the large Camel next to her.

K: "Mister Ambassador." I nodded. "This is General Staff Officer Applejack Apple, and Secretary of State Raven Inkwell." I introduced them with a wave of the hand.

Twilight was behind him, and she was giving me LOOKS.. like.. I'm rolling with this, but FEED ME LINES.

Raven Inkwell: "Mister Ambassador." She nodded to him. "I'm afraid Princess Celestia isn't available today." She delivered this line with confidence.

I could tell, inside, she was screaming.

Twilight: "Y-Yes, I'm sorry. An.. emergency came up that she needed to attend to. Personally." She nodded, moved ahead of him, and took position next to me.

K: "As fourth in charge of the Royal Government after the Prime Minister, and the Princesses, I have the authority with the Prime Minister to handle whatever comes up. How may we help, Ambassador?"

Ambassdor Hasan: "AH!" He snorted. "Such outrages." He shook his head. "But, I suppose it cannot be avoided!" He blustered. "After all, you are not Camels. You would not have our sense of formality."

Racist sonova..

K: "Again, my apologies." I shrugged. "Madame Prime Minister, what's going on?"

Twilight: "O-Oh.. ah.. Ambassador Hasan is rather outraged that we have some prisoners of his home nation." She shrugged. "He wants to negotiate their release."

K: "I see." I nodded. "That is, both, a Civilian and Military concern. Moreover, a joint NEIGHTO one."

Ambassador Hasan: "BAH! NEIGHTO indeed! We know it is Eqeustria that pulls these strings!" He snorted. "I want my prisoners."

K: "They were taken prisoner by the Kingdom of Prance, in the territory of Quirtbeck. While they are housed at a facility in Equestrian territory, they are not OUR military prisoners of war to hand over." I shrugged. "I'm afraid, you'll have to await the arrival of a Prench representative."

Ambassador Hasan: "Behh...!" He snorted. "You try to confuse me with semantics!" He pointed his hoof at me. "Prisoners are on Equestrian land, they can be handed to me by you!"

K: "It doesn't work that way, Mister Ambassador." I shrugged. "We've already called for representatives from the NEIGHTO Alliance to come over, and we can all sit down and talk about all of this." I shrugged.

Ambassador Hasan: "OH!? Will those bad doggies be there as well? I understand, they are responsible for sinking our ships! We demand reparation from THEM! Your PETS, Mister General." He crossed his forelegs.

K: "They are not my pets." I frowned.

Ambassador Hasan: "This.. NEIGHTO.. Eqeustria makes all the other nations its pets. WE know! We..! We you cannot fool!" He pointed his hoof at Twilight. "Miss Prime Minister. Feh! What you do know about these NEIGHTO people?!" He waved his foreleg. "WE know what you do when they prove useless! You feed them to the Herdiets! Like South Cowrea!"

Twilight: "Mister Ambassador.. that was not our fault. The King of South Cowrea was-"

At that moment, the "unknown party" entered. Foxes. All of them. Three in business suits, one in a military uniform, and two dressed as assistants. The military uniform was.. interesting, in that it reminded me immediately of an 1864 Union Officer's uniform.. but OD green. Complete with his rank displayed on the edges of his shoulders.

What struck me is, one of the suited ones had Pegasus wings. And the one in uniform had a Unicorn horn.

Unicorn Fox: "South Cowrea abandoned the NEIGHTO partners before they ever arrived." He paced straight over to me, keeping his paws away from his sidearm, stopping in front of me, standing, and rendering a full and proper salute. "General-Field Marshal K, Lieutenant Prime Seven Devils, Vulpesylvanian First Special Forces Squadron." He flicked his eye back towards the Ambassador. "You -sent- for me, sir?"

Now it was MY turn to play along.

K: "Yes, Lieutenant. I'm glad you and your party could get here so quickly." I returned the salute crisply. "At-ease."

He turned to at-ease, and nodded for the rest of his party to stand by us.

Ambassador Hasan: "OHHHH!! NOW I SEE!" He hissed. "YOU STAND WITH THOSE FIRETAILED D'JINN!" He pointed at Lieutenant Devils.

K: "More than that, Vulpesylvania is a NEIGHTO Partner." I shrugged.

LTP Devils: "Yes, Ambassador.. and we have alerted the town guard and police about your arrival. And the subsequent attempt by your own special operations forces to infiltrate the castle town of Canterlot." He paused, looked to me briefly, then back to Hasan. "That.. IS why you brought those extra Ponies and Zebra with you, that broke away soon before arriving at Ponyville, yes?" He smirked.

Ambassador Hasan: "AHBJ-Y'D.." He stammered, taken aback. "Ya shayatin bidhayl nari! 'ant kharabt kula shay'a! kaleadati!" He streamed curses at my new friend.

At least, I think he is.

LTP Devils: "Indeed we have." He nodded to me. "Your forces should have them rounded up rather quickly. They disguised themselves rather.. poorly, come to think of it. I don't see too many Zebra traders around.." He shrugged. "Let alone, ones working WITH ponies."

Ambassador Hasan: "YOU WILL PAY!" He sneered at Lt. Devils, motioned to his party, and turned to leave. "BE WARNED, EQUESTRIA! YOU HAVE MADE BITTER ENEMIES, THIS DAY!"

K: "Ambassador Hasan?" I said, politely.

He stopped in the doorway.

K: "I did find it rather odd that you didn't comment once about me being the Human of Legend, or just a very strange creature wearing Eqeusetria's uniform. I knew from the start you were suspect. I have a feeling, Hasan, we were enemies long before we laid eyes on each other. You can tell Tirek, of course, that I find your efforts feeble in mind and spirit. I'm sure he'd LOVE to hear that." I smirked.

Ambassador Hasan: "..we will have what is rightfully ours, Human. Fear you not of that." He said in a very dark, serious, and non-boastful tone. He spat on the ground, and departed quickly.

So much for HIM!

I turned to our new friends, and specifically Lieutenant Devils, and flapped my arms.

K: "Well! We sure pulled the wool over his eyes in a lot of ways!" I gestured to Twilight. "This is Twilight Sparkle.." Then Raven. "Raven Inkwell." And my wife. "And my dear wife, Applejack."

Applejack: "Howdy!" She gave them her brightest smile.

Twilight: "I-It's a pleasure to meet you." She shrugged, with a small grin.

Raven: "Likewise.." She let out a long sigh, looking on the verge of hyperventilating.

Flash: "General." He paced up. "King Solarenski will be here shortly. He asked if.." He looked at Lieutenant Devils. "..his guests had arrived ahead of him."

K: "They have. They bear his seal." I nodded. "When he gets here, send him to the Conference Room. And tell Hekkon to make us some lunch, but adjust the menu - Mutton and Grapes." I eyed Devils.

He beamed a grin ten miles wide.

LTP Devils: "Grapes!?" He looked at his companions. "Hear that, sir? Fancy eating! And you were worried Equestrians wouldn't understand." He looked back at me. "I think the Human of Legend sure does."

Ambassador Vineworthy: "General K, I'm Ambassador Vicenzo Vineworthy. I think.. we have a lot to discuss." He shrugged his wings.


TIME: 11:46 ERST


We were seated in the Conference Room, now repaired, and lunch was being prepared - fast-roasted mutton wrapped in grape leaves, grapes of three kinds, Pirozhki, and roasted corn.

Oh, and apple pie for dessert.

K: "Please.. uh.. let's start at the beginning." I gestured..

..just as Havoc walked in, with Bella, Barker, and O'Fang.

Oh-oh.. a fox and a hound.

But.. the strangest thing happened.

Devils got out of his seat, and slowly.. slowly moved over.

Havoc eyed him.. but his tail was up. And slowly wagged.

The two of them got closer.. and started sniffing each other.

After a few moments, they moved back, face to face.

I was about to get up and separate them, but instead of attacking each other..

Havoc: "BEST FRIEND!" He cheered.

Devils: "BEST FRIEND!" He cheered back.

And they embraced. Laughing, holding each other, crying.. crying tears of joy. As though they hadn't seen each other in over a thousand years..

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: The Fox and the Hound

TIME: 11:37 ERST
DATE: War Day 877/1 Noneus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Royal Palace, Canterlot

After a couple of minutes of hugs and tears - in which Bella joined in when invited - they both sat down, facing me.

Havoc: "Back when I was a puppy, and he a cub, we met in the forest. Not knowing any better, we played. As we grew up, we played together more and more.." He shrugged. "More than even Old Twilight or any of them, he was my best friend. When we were almost adults, right before I had to take that Amulet that made me a Timberwolf, we made a Blood Oath.." He cleared his throat.

Bella: "A forbidden ritual they made ME look up." She shrugged, with a grin.

Devils: "..and, my father finally found out where I'd been all those times I snuck off." He shrugged, gesturing to Havoc. "Of course, he did not approve, and forbade us to see each other again. Not long after that.." He shook his head. "..I changed into something. Call it a.. Timber Fox." He smirked. "Some time ago, I became uncursed."

K: "I see." I looked to Vicenzo. "And your story?"

Amb. Vineworthy: "We are the remnants of the furthest expansion of the Old Roaman Empire. At first, we were barbarians to them, slaves, servants, but they taught us their ways, their knowledge. We emulated them in many ways, and became a big part of their Old Empire until it fell. Our peoples.. the Poles and the Vulpines.. have known of each other for some time. After we heard that a weapon of indescribable power was used on Moscow, and knowing the Herdiets would respond.." He shrugged his wings, and flapped them to his side. "..if they decide that the nations next to us, or our coastline in the east should be theirs.." He looked up as his thought was cut off.

King Solarenski: "Bahaha! They come to US!" He stepped in with his Entourage. "Marshal K!" He patted me on the shoulders. "My good friends, the Foxes!"

K: "Interesting." I nodded. "So, you want to join NEIGHTO to gain political protection from the Herdiets?"

Amb. Vineworthy: "Not just that, General K. We, too, have been victims of Tirek's various injustices. Mainly saboteurs and agents-provocateur. Special Operations sorts of things." He slowly shook his head. "As a result, we have a very active and recently thoroughly experienced National Police Agency and Special Forces."

K: "Are they landlocked?" I looked at Solarenski. "Are you landlocked, Ambassador?" I asked.

Amb. Vineworthy: "No.. ah.. our coastline is southern Europe. We border Macedonkia, Blowgaria, and Messaria." He nodded.

Interesting.. this made them this world's equivalent of Greece, but without the Hellenic accents. Actually, their accents were closer to American Midwest without the lilt.

K: "Alright.. alright.." I nodded. "Are you prepared to join the conflict against Tirek and accept me as Supreme Allied Commander?" I tilted my head.

Amb. Vineworthy: "We are, sir." He nodded firmly, and adjusted his glasses. "King Solarenski has been very generous with information. We've already aligned our rank and structure to comply with NEIGHTO standards. King Solarenski provided us with some Shermans, Pattons, and a couple Pershings.. from which we've created our own arms. We have an armed Navy being constructed, now, that should put to sea within four months. We have the basic structure of an Air Force, but we've no way to train pilots on actual aircraft. Our National Police Agency can trace its roots back over a thousand years, and the Prince's Royal Guard, while more a ceremonial and palace defense force, has received combat training according to the NEIGHTO standardized training doctrine."

K: "I see." I nodded to him. "And what's this with the Camels, then?"

Amb. Vineworthy: "Back when our nation was larger, and we controlled larger sections of southern Europe, we had conflict with them. Regularly. We tried to colonize lands on their side of the ocean. While we ARE predators, and do have some natural advantage over them.." He shrugged. "..not only did they field more Camels than we Foxes, they are very tough combatants in hoof-to-paw combat. We Foxes aren't large body predators, like our Wolf cousins." He nodded to Havoc. "So, whatever natural advantages we had, were neutralized by their superior numbers."

K: "And your nation has been in some decline?" I asked, tilting my head.

Amb. Vineworthy: "Well.. yes." He nodded. "About a thousand years ago, we controlled large sections of what's now Blowgaria, Messaria, and Macedonkia. They.. started infiltrating us. At first, it was just some small settlements along the border. Then.. they started penetrating our territory and causing crimes. Small ones, at first, nothing troublesome. Then, bigger ones. Before we knew it, we'd lost control of the border regions, had criminal gangs operating openly in the streets, had our cubs being stolen and forced into slavery, and settlements all over our territory. We had no.. no organized force that could resist it. Our first step was creating the National Police Agency to fight the criminal gangs. Our Palace Guards.." He cleared his throat.

Devils: "They were seen as a joke. Worse, they allowed the last King of Vulpesylvania to be killed, through their inattention." He nodded.

Amb. Vineworthy: "Yes." He nodded. "Since then, we've borne that shame by not crowning a King."

K: "Interesting. This happened around the same time as the end of the Equestrian Racial Conflict." I nodded.

Amb. Vineworthy: "Oh, yes. We knew about it happening - in FACT.. someone important to that, came to our lands, to warn us that dark forces were afoot. We ignored him." He frowned.

Twilight: "GALLART BONEBEARD!" She shouted out.

Amb. Vineworthy: "Yes! Yes, that was his name!" He beamed a grin.

Devils: "Holey moley.. you guys don't think.." He furrowed his brow. "..maybe we've all been victims of either Tirek or some other manipulator all this time?"

K: "We thought Tirek might've had something to do with SEVERAL major catastrophes over the last eight thousand plus years." I frowned.

Devils: "You don't think.. Tirek has been going after US, too!?" He tilted his head.

K: "That depends. What do you have, culturally, that covers the Human of Legend?" I shrugged.

Amb. Vineworthy: "Chief?" He nodded to the Vixen in the grey slate suit.

Chief of Police Intelligence Makara Totonni: "We have information on the exact location of the Rainbow of Light, as it was, at the end of our Time of Chaos.. which would align with 47 C.S." She nodded with a small grin. "Moreover, it was one of our Gods that supposedly forged the Sword of Rainbow's Light.. AND.. we're supposed to play some kind of role in preparing the Human of Legend to confront The Darkness." She waved a paw.

Twilight: "Where?! The Rainbow.. where?" She had a notepad out, but Raven took over on that front.

Chief Totonni: "Far in the north, in what was once the Original Empire of Harmony, at the Magical Fortress of Friendship." She nodded. "We have a map that should be.. within a couple of kilometers accurate." She smiled.

K: "Well. As far as I'm concerned. You're offering matching forces for NEIGHTO and are willing to accept our command. That's.. that's more than enough for me." I shrugged, as Forest Spirit and Sacquet came in.

Sacquet: "Ah.. as acting Supreme Allied Commander, I.." He put a hoof on my shoulder. "..relinquish command."

Forest Spirit: "Ah, same. You seem to be up and at'em." He shrugged. "Commandant of Marines Forest Spirit." He nodded to the Foxes.

Sacquet: "G‚n‚ral de Brigade de la L‚gion Phillipe Sacquet." He nodded with a grin, and stuck his hoof out to Devils.

Devils: "Lieutenant Prime Seven Devils, First Special Forces Squadron, Vulpesylvanian Army." He nodded, and shook hoof-and-paw with Sacquet.

K: "Well, now that I have my full authority back, I can assure you, the NEIGHTO partners will accept you. Right, King Vladislav?" I smirked.

King Solarenski: "BAHAHA! YES!" He nodded firmly, thumping his hoof on my shoulder. "I assure you, Ambassador, personally, I have fought in da field, back to back, with de Human of Legend. He fight like wild LION!" He grinned very broadly. "I would lay down my life next to him, if such is needed. For, I know, he can help us stand up and fight. All of us. Every one of us." He grew serious with that.

Devils: "Then we will win." He came over and held his paw out to me. "New friend."

K: "Friend." I took his paw and shook it.

More friends, more allies, and our alliance grows. With each day that passes, we grow stronger. And as we all know? Friendship is Magic.

After lunch, I had Raven and Twilight take the diplomatic party towards the Government offices for a tour, while we waited for official representatives from the rest of NEIGHTO. Meanwhile, I took Seven Devils around with Havoc.

Devils: "So, really, after I became Uncursed, I wanted to see where the rest of Foxkind went after almost ten millenia. When I arrived in Vulpesylvania, I was surprsied to see that our civilization had changed so much, yet remained so much the same." He shrugged.

Havoc: "I'm just glad you're okay." He nodded. "I didn't think.. you know.." He shrugged.

K: "A couple others from that time are still around, and our allies, now - Katrina and Somnambula. Lavan has agreed to remain asleep. Rep is dead. Grogar is dead, too, as is Bray." I nodded.

Devils: "Mmm. Good." He nodded a bit. "A bit surprised Katrina would switch sides.."

Havoc whispered something to him, and they both laughed.

K: "So, your people have developed their own arms?" I asked, ignoring the very likely comment that I literally fucked her for her loyalty.

Devils: "Yes. Our Intelligence foxes first gathered weapons from the Herdiet Union, then the Poles gave us some of the War Aid you have given them, while they researched how to construct their own." He shrugged a bit.

K: "Sounds good. We don't have to catch you up, then. Navy?" I nodded.

Devils: "We're constructing two small Battleships, three Cruisers, four Destroyers, and four Frigates at the moment. Our shipyards aren't very big." He shrugged.

K: "If those cruisers are on the larger side, you might want to convert one into a Carrier. The Canidans decided to make one." I nodded. "Carriers will be very important, soon."

Devils: "Interesting." He nodded.

Right about then, one of the infiltrators made themselves known from the general city crowd. A few yelps as he knocked some ponies aside, and from my right, he came charging towards me from about 10 meters distant - too close to draw my pistol, I already knew that. I was about to pivot and back up, when Seven Devils interceeded..

He rose to his hind legs as the Gizmonk got closer, and delivered a perfect roundhouse kick to his sternum, knocking him back, before assuming a loose martial stance. The Gizmonk was slid back on his heels, a knife already in one hand, and one grasped in his tail.

Not surprising to me at all, the Gizmonk assumed the "Monkey" Kung-Fu stance.

What DID surprise me was seeing Seven Devils assume his OWN stance, and slide down and forwards. As the Gizmonk tried to leap over him, Devils popped straight up as the Gizmonk went over top of him, grabbed the Gizmonk's clothing in his teeth, and whipped him to the ground. He then somersaulted and dive-punched the Gizmonk in the balls.

Flipping off of the Gizmonk, but immediately to his side, Devils slid around his back and locked in a rear-naked choke.

This told me that Vulpes were FAR more flexible than Canids, and seemed to blend the general flexible bodies of Ponies with the digits of Canids.. blended well, meaning, they lost the strength of the Canids in the trade.

Still.. fascinating biology.

K: "Don't kill him, I want him alive." I nodded.

Devils: "Oh. Alright." He nodded.. holding him just long enough to make him lose consciousness. "Sleepy time, now." He smirked and stood up.

Right about then, some of the Guards came over to see what happened, along with a pair of Gendarmes.

Lance Corporal of the Guard Highland Rivers: "General!" She nodded. "What happened?"

Havoc: "Infiltrator." He nodded. "My buddy Seven Devils stopped 'em." He smirked.

LCotG Rivers: "Oh!" She nodded to the others with her, and the prisoner was quickly bound up. "Are you alright, General? We've been chasing Infiltrators since the Vulpesylvanian Mission arrived and warned us." She shrugged.

K: "Oh, I'm fine." I shrugged. "If any of the Vulpes are working with you, afford them every possible grace and permission." I nodded. "They're NEIGHTO partners, now."

Well, not.. officially.. but, soon enough.

LCotG Rivers: "Yes, sir!" She nodded and headed off.

Devils: "Is it always this exciting?" He asked as Gaze and Gorcat came up.

Gorcat: "Uh-huh! This here's a FIGHTIN' outfit." He gave a broad grin.

Gaze: "Mhm. Join th' army, foight nasty wizzerds 'n monsters." He nodded to me. "We got th' message that somethin' were up, K. S'who'dis?" He nodded to Devils.

K: "Lieutenant Seven Devils, this is Lidless Gaze and Gorcat." I gestured. "Two of my General's Staff. And Gorcat is right - I tend to lead from the front."

Firecracker: "More like, you ARE the Front. Sir." She giggled a bit, and paced up, extending a hoof. "Firecracker Burst, Recon."

Devils shook with her, then Gaze, and then Gorcat.

Devils: "So.. do we have the official backing of the Griffon Kingdom, or..?" He cocked a brow.

K: "I've never even met with one of their diplomats. We're trying to arrange something through intermediaries, though. I'd like to get them to join NEIGHTO, and perhaps even directly hire some of the Outcast Bands as Privateers against Tirek, and partially pay them in recovered booty." I shrugged.

Devils: "Mmm.. I can't say we have much to do with them, but there IS a problem - our location information on the Rainbow of Light is very close to their claimed Arctic Territory, if not within it. They laid claim to a large swath of Arctic territory along the largest mountain range in the world. The range itself isn't claimed, but right on the other side is Khyangese territory, stretching both east and west." He nodded.

K: "Sooo.. huh. That would mean, from my Earth's perspective, China and Russia are geographically flipped north and south, with Russia still close to what I'd call the Pacific Coast, but China above it.. and STILL with the Himalayas existing, just shifted far East, and a boundary to the western parts of China. Huh." I nodded, looking at Webley as she came up, troubled.

Webley: "Yeah, that's about right, K, but.." She frowned. "..two things. One, we still can't find any trace of Braeburn's corpse.. and when I say that, I mean, Toola and I tried to basically sense for it with our Special Talents, and we got NOTHING. Two.." She sighed. "..Soarin is.." She lowered her head. "..Spitfire relieved him of duty an hour ago. He was trying to suck-start his Morgan."

K: "Ohh.. my God..." And just like that, the bottom dropped out of my emotions. I shook my head. "I'm going to go see him. Gaze? Show Devils, here, how we do things on my General's staff. Show him anything he wants. Back 10,000 years ago, he was Havoc's best friend.. so, he's ours, too."

Gaze: "Aye, suh." He nodded.

And with that, I headed to the temporary Air Force Officer Barracks at the Fort Defense Base Annex. The walk was a good thirty minutes.

Part 5: Broken Eagle

TIME: 18:05 ERST
DATE: War Day 877/1 Noneus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Air Force Temporary Barracks, Fort Defense Base Annex, Canterlot

Soarin had been one of my best and bravest when the war began. He was also my cousin-in-law. I owed it to him to see if I could help him somehow. I had a feeling Dr. Turner might be an eventuality, though.

Soarin's room was under guard by an Air Force Security Protection NCO.

Chief Aircrew Slapshot: "General K?" She nodded to me. "Chief Slapshot, Fort Defense AF-SP's. Major Spitfire asked me to guard Lieutenant Soarin, sir."

Slapshot was one of those tall ponies.. statuesque, like Campanula. She was also somewhat slightly built, and a Unicorn. Odd that she'd pick a ground combat assignment in the Air Force, but I'd see about this later.

K: "Thank you, Chief, you're relieved, but don't go too far. I need some privacy." I shrugged.

C.A. Slapshot: "You got it, sir." She moved over to the lobby of the building and had herself a seat next to the tea kettle, and started brewing up.

I went inside.

Soarin' was laying flat on his stomach, on his bed, nude, and smelled like he hadn't showered in days.

I sat on the bed with him.

K: "Soarin?" I pet his mane.

Soarin: "Mmf.." He didn't move.

K: "Come on, man. You need to wash up." I knew Mental Health well enough to know that once you stop caring about hygiene, you're at the absolute frayed end of your mental rope.

I lift/dragged him out of the bed. He weighed about 100lbs. That's a stretch for me to be lugging around like this, even with my improved physical condition.

Setting him on his hooves, he just slowly lowered to the ground, instead of standing. His eyes locked with the floor.

I reached under him, and forced him to stand, and forced him into the small bathroom, then forced him into the shower. Testing the water, making sure it was 'hot but not too hot,' I turned it on full blast, and let him get soaked.

He sat there for a bit, then started crying angrily.

K: "There's a rea-WHOA!"

He snapped up with speed I didn't expect, and grabbed me, pulling me into the shower with him (fully clothed).

Soarin: "WHY HIM!? WHY HIM!? WHY NOT ME!? WHY NOT SOMEONE ELSE!? I CAN'T EVEN BURY HIM! I CAN'T.." He lost all strength, and just slumped down. "..I'm all alone, now."

K: "Ergh.." I pulled back. "..come on, man, at least wash up. You smell like a barn gone wrong." I made a face, but I stepped back a bit. "I'm going to go change your sheets." I shook my head.

They WERE absolutely filthy. And what made it a bit more disturbing was that you could make out an outline of his body on them. Such was the level of filth. He hadn't showered.. God, how long?! Whatever. I was also soaked to the bone, so, I just stripped down to my boxers without thinking about it and set the clothes over by the central air vent, and turned the heat up to get them dryer.

Not fully dry - I'd need them laundered, now - but dry enough that I'll be able to get them back on and leave after I was done.

I proceeded to completely strip his bed down, fold up the sheets (they REEKED of sweat and depression), and walked out into the hallway to throw them into the nearest incinerator chute.

Yes, we have those, and they're mainly designed for disposing of top secret documents. Some Officer's Quarters have them, some don't, but they're a thing. My quarters at the palace has a fireplace instead, and I just burn anything I need to, myself.

I went back in with clean sheets, and started putting the bed back together. Once I was done - and got new pillows completely, because gross otherwise - I was about to check on Soarin, when he came out of the shower, drying himself off.

He smelled a million times better. Vaguely of bubblegum.

K: "Feel better?" I sat next to him as he sat on the bed. "Come on, Soarin.. I'm worried about you. A lot."

He hugged me, I let him, and he just kinda cried into me for a bit. It didn't even occur to me that I was basically sitting in my unders, next to a naked male that preferred males.

DATE: War Day 878/2 Noneus, 1004 C.S.

Big Mac: "Thank'ya, Chief! 'Preciate ya stayin' outside th-"

Thing is, I could hear Mac's voice, but it didn't seem real at first.

Big Mac: "SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!" He bellowed.

I yawned, stretched, and sat up, looking at Big Mac and Applejack, as she came sauntering in, wearing jeans and a green button-down (remember, readers, this is a big flirt on her part).

Big Mac: "Well, Brother!" He nodded. "I didn't know you liked Stallions!" He smirked.

Applejack: "OH, WHUT IN TARNATION!?" She shot off. "REALLY?? AH WAS JES. DOWN. THA. BLOCK!" She.. actually looked angry. Jealous, even.

Then.. I realized why.

I was in my boxers, in bed, with a naked Soarin.. and he was cuddled up to me like I was a big human teddy bear.

I poked him in the head. HARD.

K: "Wake up and defend your General." I stated, flatly.

Soarin: "Hmm? From what? Last night was so awesome, a-" He looked at Applejack, who looked ready to SKIN HIM ALIVE. "NOT LIKE THAT! NOT LIKE THAT! I SWEAR TO CELELSTIA!" He immediately waved his hooves rapidly in denial.

Applejack: "YOU?" She stalked over to the bed, absolutely green-eyed, and grabbed Soarin around the shoulders.

Soarin: "Jackie! Please! I promise! WE DID NOT FUCK!" He looked ready to die of humiliation.

K: "We didn't, honey, I promise." I held my hand over my heart, and slid out of bed. "He did a lot of crying and just.. kinda fell asleep against me." I shrugged. "Jackie.." I nodded to Mac. "Shut that door."

He did so, then looked at me, expecting a REAL explanation, this time.

K: "Soarin' tried to take his life yesterday afternoon." I put my hands on my beloved's forelegs.

Applejack: "I-" She went from angry face, to absolutely crushed, with tears forming all around her eyes, and she hugged him, and SHE cried, into HIS shoulder.

Mac: "Ah.. Soarin.." He came over, and.. with a little hesistation (because he's not a hugger), slid his forelegs around him. "Damnit to Tartarus, Cousin.." He shook his head. "..I didn't know."

K: "That's the point of suicide. There's signs, but they don't announce it until it happens. Spitfire got lucky and caught him just in time." I shrugged, and put my (now totally dry) uniform on.

It struck me that, even though we had tried to give him love and support, his sorrow was just too overpowering. This brought to mind the Spell of Carefree.. that it had limits.. it must, if it existed.

Either way, something this serious.. could not be ignored. I had Soarin placed under observation, and Dr. Turner advised. She scheduled him for therapy. Soarin voluntarily asked to be placed on inactive medical leave until he felt better. Honestly, that was the only thing we COULD do.

The heart has to have time to heal.
