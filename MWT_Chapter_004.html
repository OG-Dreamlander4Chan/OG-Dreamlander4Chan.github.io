Theia: "DADDY!"

I heard that as I stirred from my slumber. What I got was an ALICORN BODY TACKLING ME IN MY BED!

Theia: "DADDYDADDYDADDY!" She hugged me so tight, I couldn't breathe.

K: "AIR!" I gasped out. "Daddy! NEED! AIR!"

Sunny, Izzy, and Hitch all woke up, too. We'd been quartered in the same room.

They saw a dark purple Alicorn, looking a lot like Princess Luna once had, but with a different Cutie Mark, and moreover, auburn hair instead of nightly blue. She was quite large, too. My little girl was a bit bigger than Celestia had been.

She cried, I cried - sobbed - as we held each other. The others.. ehh.. just kinda shrugged and watched.

It took us a full ten minutes of blubbering over each other for us to calm down.

Theia: "Daddy..." She wiped her tears, as I wiped the snot from her nose.

K: "My baby girl." I sniffled.

Theia: "Oh, Daddy.. I'm.. I'm so happy!" She started crying again. "Oh, it's been SO LONG!" And hugged me.

A thousand years for her.

Ten years for me.

K: "Mommy's gone.. honey. I'm so sorry, you never got to meet her." That got ME crying again, over J--. "I miss her.. and I missed you so much."

Theia: "Did.. you remember.. us?" She tilted her head, nuzzling me.

K: "Kinda? Like, when I slept, I dreamt of my time here. I could remember after I woke up, but.." I shook my head. "It's not like I had some group of friends that would believe me."

(Yeah, shout-out to my Discord community - what, you think the sidebars stopped with Book 1? Hell no.)

Theia: "Oh, Daddy." She finally collected herself. "As Princess of New Equestria, I restore your rank as Commander-in-Chief, General of the New Equestrian Armed Forces." She sighed. "I can do.. just this." She focused her horn intensely, at the same level as one casting a very high level spell, but all that happened, was three buttons with her Cutie Mark on them, appeared in my hand.

K: "You're.. so weak, honey." I shrugged. "But, thank you." I nodded. "I'll get these on my uniform." I kissed her snout. "Oh, shit, where are my manners?" I pointed to Sunny. "She's from Liberty."

Theia: "Greetings! Please, call me Aunt Theia. We are family." She said, her voice normalizing after the outburst, and I realized she sounded A LOT like Luna did, but with a softer voice, reminding me more of Dusk's other daughters - and if Dusk was right, that tone came from his mom.

Sunny: "Sunrise Magic Starscout. Call me Sunny." She nodded to Hitch and Izzy. "These are my friends, Hitch and Izzy."

Hitch: "Ah, your-your highness." He tried to bow, sitting up in bed.

Izzy: "Hee-hee - HIYA!" She waved dramatically.

Theia: "Oh, Daddy. So much has happened." She sighed.

Zipp: "My Goddess.." She paced in, still in her PJ's, wiping her eyes, with Pipp in tow.. "..what's going ON, K? It's so early!"

Pipp: "OHMIGOSH! PRINCESS THEIA!" She held her hooves over her mouth momentarily, then smacked Zipp a couple times, to get her to bow or something.

Theia: "Please, please, Zipp, Pipp.." She shook her head. "..your mother has already told me you're joining my daddy. No formalities."

Zipp: "Suits me fine." She hopped up on the bed Sunny was on, and lolled her head against her. "So sleepy."

Pipp: "Ohhhh... I soooooo want to stream this." She huffed.

K: "This morning, I'm making a formal announcement - the tailor should be bringing me my new Class A Formals. Once I can be properly dressed." I wagged a finger. "Theia? Daughter? I want a full report. No secrets."

Theia: "..yes, Daddy.." She looked sullen. "It all started thirty six years to the day after you beat Tirek. Most of our best veterans were elderly. The new ones were good, but not experienced. That wasn't the issue, though. Like Uncle Sombra had been, we were attacked by The Umbrals."

Sunny: "U-Umbrals?!" She stammered.

Theia: "Please, don't interrupt, this is very.. painful for me to remember." She shook her head. "Everyone at the palace scrambled for some kind of a solution. But they were everywhere. Killing so many. Dragging some back through these portals." She sniffled. "Finally, Mom and everyone.. decided the only thing they could do was seal the magic. The Umbrals wanted it. They wanted the source of all Equestrian magic, it was the only thing that could hurt them, besides the Crystal Heart. I don't know.. what happened to Aunt Cadence." She shook her head. "So, Twilight and Sunset devised a spell to infuse the Unity Crystal with all the magic in the land, wiping the slate completely clean of all magic and magical effects. They focused the energy into the largest Umbral portal, and sealed it, but in so doing.. the Unity Crystal split.. and.." She sniffled. "..I was being evacuated to Springfield when I saw the magical detonation at Canterlot. It was so huge, my helicopter crashed, and I was badly injured. Another Alicorn named Opaline Arcana found me. She was a cousin to Celestia and Luna.. through Galactica Spark's sister, she said." She shrugged. "Opaline rescued me, and now that magic was gone, she agreed to help me rebuild what was left. She's been my mentor ever since." She looked at me straight. "No one of your friends was there. The few with me.. died." She lowered her head. "Aunt Celestia and Mom designated me as the survivor of the Royal Family. They told me.. I had to be strong. Like you. And Other Daddy." She smiled a bit.

Hitch: "Whoa.. so THAT'S what happened!" He shook his head.

Theia: "Yes." She sighed, letting out a long breath. "It took us over two hundred years to even get half way back to where we once were, another hundred to stabilize what settlements we had. So many very smart ponies were lost.." She looked down and away. "..education seems pointless when you have starving foals." And sniffled sadly, only for me to hug her tightly. "After three hundred years, things became stable, and we started to improve. The old state capital building in Providence is where Parliament usually meets, though we.." She shrugged. "..we keep most of the offices here in Zephyr Heights."

K: "Yeah, we took a tram to get up here from the base of the mountain." I shrugged. "It doesn't seem to get much use."

Theia: "Yes, the tram station was once very popular, and travel between Zephyr Heights Base Station and other towns, very regular, but over the last century or so.. things have.." She looked me in the eyes. "..friendship is dying, Daddy, and I don't know how to fix it!" She started crying AGAIN, this time feeling like she'd failed me. I just hugged her.

Hitch: "This is why everything's so split up, isn't it?" He tilted his head.

Theia: "Yes. With the bonds of friendship growing lean, travel has decreased significantly." She sighed slowly. "Trade, too. You're Sheriff of Maretime Bay. Can you say that many travel outside of your Area Command?" She tilted her head.

Hitch: "..come to think of it, no. And we tend to get real jealous if some other Area Command gets up in our business." He looked at Zipp, who was half asleep. "Sorry, Zipp."

Zipp: "Mhmhh." She gave a dismissive hoof-wave. "It's all goooood."

Theia: "What's our first step, Daddy?" She blinked her big-ol' eyes at me.

K: "Does Opaline know more about the Umbrals?" I tilted my head to her.

Theia: "Yes. And now that I've grown, she lives in an old castle near here. It's on Mount Teratorn." She nodded.

K: "I remember where that is. That was Celestia's old winter vacation castle, before Luna returned." I shrugged.

Theia: "Yes. I let her use it." She shrugged. "Opaline is very knowledgeable. She taught me how to focus what little magic I have to do simple tricks." She looked out the window. "Like Mommy, I'm strongest at night, but I keep a schedule where I am awake in the mornings as well." She sighed. "I have to lead a country, after all."

Sunny: "I remember in the old legends, it said Celestia used to raise the sun-"

Theia: "OH! That old chestnut." She giggled. "Auntie Celestia didn't actually raise it - Equus revolves around the sun, as do the other planets. Did you think Equus was the center of the universe?" She smiled to Sunny.

Sunny: "....er, yeah, I kinda did." She blushed. "I feel silly."

K: "Don't." I nodded. "A lot of ponies thought that because of the ceremonies Celestia created to form a sort of religion around herself to keep ponykind focused on something other than the problems of racial integration two thousand years ago." I looked at Theia. "I'm guessing history only teaches the last few hundred years? And maybe some of the oldest legends?"

Theia: "We teach what we can. I excluded a lot of history from the curriculum. Mainly so ponies don't worry over things they cannot change." She shrugged her wings. "The history is still available if they go to the University." She smiled. "Most ponies, though, don't - you know how it is. You get your Mark and you do a job."

K: "Only now, instead of the Spell of Carefree being part of the reason, civilization being on a precipice is the driving factor." I frowned. "Celestia would've done the same thing, I think." And nodded. "For starters, we need to unite the Unity Crystal, though if Opaline is that close by, we may as well see her before we leave for Bridlewood." I nodded.

Theia: "You should know, Daddy." She looked down a moment. "Opaline.. is.. someone I allied with out of convenience. I do not fully trust her as I would Mommy or Auntie Celestia. I have long detected something from her that isn't honest." She frowned. "Other Daddy's powers gave me the ability to sense that."

K: "Dusk was one of the best Guards ever." I nodded. "Honestly, I thought so." I shrugged. "That you'd get something from him."

Sunny: "This is all so amazing to think about." She shook her head. "I want to know ALL the legends! And know the truth, not just the small stuff, and know where I might not have the full story."

Theia: "Of course, my Niece." She smiled.

So, now, I knew the situation. I knew I'd get no help from the past, it seemed. Theia didn't know the final tactical situation on the ground, and I knew she didn't even want to think about her brother and sisters, what might've become of them.. it hurt too much. But, we had a direction, and a plan.

Now? Ponykind needed to know that the Human of Legend had returned, and Pipp was the perfect pony to help me spread the message.

Pipp set up her best camera - not the one on her phone - and had her lucky microphone and everything. All of it for what she Chirped out to the masses, would be a VERY SPECIAL announcement by Princess Theia, Prime Minister Haven, and a very special guest.

I was in my new Class "A" Formal Uniform. I deliberately designed it to resemble my old one. Black tunic, that came down to the mid thigh. Black slacks. Black boots. Grey shirt. Black tie. Black peaked cap.

I was a bit nervous.

Pipp: "You'll be fine, K! This. Is going to be SO fab." She slung her foreleg around me. "The Pippsqueaks and everyone in New Equestria is going to go cra-aaaa-zzaaeeeyy!" She sang that last word.

K: "I'm ready." I nodded.

Pipp: "Okay.. and.. here we go." She clicked it on. "HELLO PIPPSQUEAKS!" She paused, knowing her audience. "As you see, my mother, Prime Minister Haven, and Princess Theia are here. AND! We have a special guest!" She flourished a bow. "Now, let me give this over to the totally excellent, the wonderful, the Princess with the mostest.. Princess Theia!" She bowed again, and held the Mic for Theia.

Theia: "My Little Ponies. As you should all know from school, one thousand and fifty years ago, we fought a terrible war against Dark King Tirek. What most of you know, also, is that a mysterious entity from another place was there to lead us, teach us, and most.. most importantly.. love us like we were his own. That entity was my father. Those that know him, and know of him, know him as the Human of Legend, or to those in our valiant Armed Services, General K." She stood to one side. "I am.. most honored to announce to you all.. that he has returned." She raised a hoof and allowed me to step into frame.

I, too, waited. I knew there would be cheers, screaming, excitement, and more.

K: "MY.. Little Ponies. My daughter speaks the truth. One thousand years ago, I came to help you all." I lowered my head a bit, taking off my peaked cap. "It was.. my honor.. to do so. YOu are all so very, very special. You don't know HOW special. I am very sorry that I could not prevent what has happened. At the moment of my victory over Tirek, I was torn away from you all against my will, and sent back from whence I came." I looked to Theia. "I didn't even get to see my daughter grow up." And back to the camera. "You are all very, very special to me. And as I did once before, I pledge my life to you all. I would die at this moment if it meant undoing all the suffering that you've been through." I shook my head. "I could not stop it." And I nodded. "But, I will find a way to fix things. I promise. However, as it was before, so shall it be again - I cannot do ANY.. thing.. without your help." I gestured to the camera. "All of you, down to the youngest foal, together. United. Friends." I gently pulled Pipp closer. "All of us." I shook my head. "We must all stand together if we're to destroy the darkness that plagues our lands. And we CAN do it - I know how. Once more, I will give you all the tools you need. And, as I said, I don't care if I die in the process, so long as my life traded means you can ALL live in peace, harmony, and most especially, safety." I nodded to Pipp. "Pipp will provide regular updates as she can, to all her Pippsqueaks." I shrugged. "I guess I'm one, too, now." I smiled. "Together. We will overcome the Darkness once again." I got serious. "Military commanders can expect orders to come down within the next 24 hours."

Haven: "Civil leaders can expect Parliament to pass additional legislation for the new war effort very soon. But, this is not just war, this is our redemption, our salvation!" She stomped her hoof on the ground gently, but firmly. "We can unite. This kingdom is heir to a legacy - and we can be that legacy again!" She nodded. "Additional instructions to civil authorities will start to arrive within two to three days."

Theia: "Our kingdom has a reason, again, to be hopeful." She said, as Sunny, Hitch, Izzy, and Zipp joined us before the camera. "Answers will be coming soon. We will destroy the darkness, and live up to the beauty and splendor our nation had when I was a foal."

K: "Do not fear the darkness, any more, Little Ponies." I nodded to the camera. "For soon, WE shall be the bigger, scarier, monster in that darkness, bringing forth the light of our love and friendship to everyone. We will chase the darkness back into its hole, and we will defeat it once again." I placed my hand over my heart. "As I did one thousand years ago to the Immortal Sun Goddess Celestia, I swear now to ALL of you: My life, my everything, for you. For you all."

Pipp: "...and, cut, and clear." She started bouncing. "OH! That was FAA-BUU-LOOOUSS!" She hugged her mom. "You were great, Mom!"

Haven: "I certainly hope so!" She smiled.

Haven and I were talking. She was VERY sweet. I really liked her. She had a very motherly vibe. I was telling her jokes from Earth, and funny memories I had from a thousand years ago. She was CACKLING at points. Zipp and Pipp were rolling. It was fun, seeing them kick up their little hooves.

Theia was just glad to spend some time with me, after so long.

Haven: "..had I known you were so charming as WELL as brave, I would have prayed for your return even harder." She smiled.

Zipp: "Well, Mom.. Galactica Spark provides. See?" She shrugged a bit.

K: "..yeah." I looked down at my snack.

I didn't want to tell them all the stress Galactica Spark put me through. Zipp seemed to worship her a lot. Moreso, so did Haven. Sunny and the others seemed neutral.

Religion was going to be touchy, here, I could see. Another minefield. No matter.

Theia: "I'm looking forward to spending time with you, Daddy." She smiled a bit. "It will take us time to work back up to a point where we can bring the nation to bear against this darkness." She nodded.

K: "Logistics win wars." I nodded. "First thing's first, we need to talk to Opaline, then unite the parts of the Unity Crystal."

Haven: "Yes." She nodded. "I know only of ours." She pointed her hoof to my pocket. "I don't know how it ended up in our family's possession, but.." She shook her head.

Sunny: "As we covered, I can imagine there's a piece in Bridlewood, given how it's mostly unicorns there, but.." She shook her head. "I have no idea what the Earth Crystal would look like, or where it might be."

Haven: "Sunny, dear, I'm sure we can find it." She smiled to her. "Oh, you kids are so delightful." She smiled. "I feel like a filly again."

K: "I'm glad, Haven." I gave her a smile back. "One thing the war taught me, is, even in the face of tragedy, we can find happiness and joy. That's one thing you little ponies have - you are absolutely able to smile despite the worst rain." I nodded a bit to Haven. "You said you wanted a son like me - I wish my mom had been as supportive of me as you've been."

Theia: "I'll arrange transportation to Opaline's castle." She nodded.

Hitch: "I can drive!" He smiled, having swallowed his sandwich quickly to speak up.

Zipp: "Cool." She smiled at Hitch. "I mean, not everyone can." She lilted her head to the side.

This time, I did see Sunny give a glare to Zipp. A defensive one, like she wanted to step in, but she didn't quite feel like she should.

I'd talk to her later.

Pipp: "Ohhh! I can't wait to make some MYUUU-HUUU-ZIIIC....!" She sang that last word. "Oh, my gosh. I'm going to-" She looked at me. "-you think everypony'll want me to?"

K: "You mean, inspire them." I said, as she was so animated, she was almost skipping the point.

Pipp nodded, and beamed a grin.

Izzy: "Oh, I'm suuuure everypony will just sparkle and shine when they hear you, Pipp." She leaned over and hooked Pipp's neck in her foreleg, waving wide.

K: "Happiness is where you find it." He nodded. "Pipp, I think you can keep everypony happy - you have a special talent for music, and music has a magic all its own."

Theia: "Yes... yes, it is!" She raised her head. "I think.. Daddy.. we've been so focused on the magic we've lost all this time, we've forgotten the magic that's left!" She clopped her hoof on the table.

K: "There IS other kinds of magic. I know Sigil magic still works, and that's based on spiritual power, not mana." I waved a hand. "I... tried to use a Wind Sigil. And it nearly knocked me out." I shrugged.

Theia: "Yes.." She blinked. "..again,-"

K: "Opaline. She would know." I nodded again. "How long will it take to get there by car?"

Theia: "An hour, maybe less." She shrugged. "Total travel time would be about two." She nodded, and smiled.

K: "I'd like to go as soon ss possible." I said, hugging Theia again. "Not that I don't want to spend time with my little girl, all grown up now."

Theia: "Of course." She nodded. "Sergeant Zoom." She motioned for one of the Royal Guards to come over.

1st SGT Zoom Zephyrwing: "Yes, Majesty." He bowed slightly to her. "I'll get a vehicle prepared."

I eyed him up. I could see dedication, but I wanted to know what else was going on upstairs. I needed a new CAG, and that meant a lot of ponies all specialized in different things.

K: "We'll go in the morning. I'd like to spend the day doing interviews. I'm sure Pipp would love to." I smiled to her.

Pipp: "YES!" She cheered. "Think you'd like to do another song with me?!"

K: "My honor." I bowed my head.

I had no idea how fateful my interaction with Opaline would be.

DATE: Redemption Day 11/17 Septimus, 2054 C.S.
LOCATION: Opaline's Castle, Greenbroke, New Equestria


Celestia's old vacation castle. I had seen it before, during the war. It was smaller, cozier, and more like a "royal home" than a palace. We drove up to the outside, and I smiled. It hung off Mount Teratorn like a miniature Canterlot Castle. It gave me a sense of familiarity.

We got out of the Tactical Vehicle, and as we did, I could feel like I was being watched. I wasn't a magic adept. But, I remembered how things felt. I remembered how magic flowed. And with so little of it around, it was easier to feel what there was.

I walked up to the door, and simply knocked.

What answered was a very timid, blue-coated pony with fading dark-to-red hair, and a braid along the left side of her head. I was immediately reminded of Fluttershy. She looked up at me, with a timid blush.

Misty: "I'm.. Misty. Uh." She looked at the distant horizon. "Bright.. dawn." She blinked. "Yeah, Misty Brightdawn."

I cocked a brow at her.

Opaline: "Miiistyyy?" She chimed from inside the castle. "Who's at the door? If it's those Luna's Witnesses again, just use the garden hose, like last time."

I laughed. Hard. It was all too hilarious.

K: "No, no, I'm General K!" I called into the castle. "I'm here to see you, Opaline!"

There was a pause, a lot of shuffling of things, and a crash, then Opaline opened the door fully, with very obviously freshly brushed hair, and a headdress hastily applied.

Opaline: "Well!" She attempted an air of superiority. "The Human of Legend. As I expected, exactly when I expected."

K: "..uh-huh. Bullshit." I nodded. "One of your hoof-shoes is a slipper."

She looked at her right back hoof, realized a bunny slipper was on there instead of her fetlock greave, and quickly hid it behind her back.

Opaline: "Ah-hah-ha!" She bowed her head. "How silly!" She beckoned us in. "Come in, come in."

I entered, followed by my team.

K: "I can see the Alicorn air of superiority about you." I smiled, as everyone came in. "Misty." I nodded to her.

Misty: "Ah.. hi." She lowered her head.

Introverted. Very introverted.

Opaline: "Misty? Please get our guests some tea, hmm?" She was polite, but direct - a teacher's attitude, for sure. "I wish to speak to the human.. alloooone.." She drawled that last part out.

Misty: "Ah.. yes.. Opaline." She led the others to the kitchen area.

I followed Opaline to the upstairs area - she had arcane arts things all over the place. I recognized a few of them from different places. Wortnester's Serum! I thought of Cody Allcome.

K: "She's.." I looked back towards the stairs.

Opaline: "Her father brought her to me." She shrugged. "I took her in. Once I became aware of the Umbrals, and.. uhm.. the sacrifice of my.." She blinked. "..they were my cousins, K.." She looked down. "..I knew I was.. expected to help. Somehow." She shrugged her wings. "Twilight.. and Sunset.. they did so well." She sighed. "But, you should know, the Umbrals are going to come back. And soon." She nodded firmly to me.

K: "Misty.. is.. Alphabittle's daughter." I nodded.

Opaline: "Yes, she isss.." She flourished very slightly. "Misty is very, very special."

K: "So Alphabittle told me." I nodded.

Opaline: "I've taught Misty the magic needed to fight them directly. She had potential, K. When I saw her, I knew immediately, she had the potential to use this magic. It's.. it's not easy to cast, you know?" She nodded slowly.

K: "Really? So, is she, like The Chosen One, or something?" I tilted my head.

Opaline: "Ahhh.. not quite.. more like.. she's our last real hope to resist these things. Not every Unicorn has the proper alignments to cast these spells effectively. She's an incredibly rare Triple Alignment. Do you know how our magic works?" She nodded to me.

K: "Somewhat." I nodded back.

Opaline: "It's been sealed over the last thousand years, but, in short, she's a Solar-Void-Light." She sighed a bit.

K: "I see. No wonder you whisked her away so fast." I nodded. "Let me guess - the Umbrals would've become aware of her, and she would've put everyone in danger."

Opaline: "Yes." She turned to me. "This tower has a great deal of magical wards and protections. Sigil magic." She raised a hoof - and swapped the bunny slipper for her proper greave. "I've taught Misty much of it. Everything I can in fifteen years. Potions and Zebronic alchemy, everything I can to make up for the lack of proper magic."

K: "That must've been a lot." I said, pacing around the room, looking at everything, pretending to be disinterested in everything. "Fifteen years. On top of a thousand plotting to take the throne for yourself?" I slowly turned to her. "I'm old - not dumb."

Opaline: "EH?!" She was taken aback.

K: "Theia has the innate ability to sense trust and honesty. She told me she felt something dishonest from you. Given the breadth and depth of your knowledge, and your clear air of superiority, you feel as I do - that an Alicorn makes the best leader of the Little Ponies, at least from a Guardian perspective." I leaned over her table at her, and slid a hand over to one of her vials. "Wortnester's Serum. Useful for identifying anything, if you know what colors it changes, how it smells, and so on." I raised back a bit. "Be honest with me, Opaline. Right now, we're equals."

Opaline: "...." She looked down. "Rrrgh!" She raised her head and glared at me. "Theia was right - you ARE smart." She snorted.. then tossed her head like an angry horse. "You're right - I do think I.. that an Alicorn.. Should lead." She paced over to me, into my personal space. "But you.. created issue." And blinked, looking right into my eyes. "Princess Theia is heir to the throne, rightfully. I prefer to be.." She tilted her head. "..Eminence Grise." She trilled that out.

I leaned all the way in to lock eyes with her.

K: "You'd be a villain if the Umbrals weren't here." I nodded. "Nice." I shrugged. "And so.. you decided that the only thing to do was to save the world, and prove Alicorn superiority." I shrugged. "Thing is.." I booped her snootle. "..I know you better than you know yourself."

Opaline: "..what?" She tilted her head, reacting to the snootle boop, looking down at the tip of her own nose.

K: "You're called to heroism. Your real, true desire is to protect all of Ponykind. YOU just want to be adored as the hero you see yourself as. YOU want to be worshipped. YOU want ponies to recognize you as the powerful, wise, respectable Alicorn you see yourself to be. You have an ego that needs fed." I was reminded of Rainbow Dash. "But, you're also beholden to etiquette, honor, and tradition. You refuse to break it, as it's so important for you to be respected. So, you can never directly act against Theia, and moreover, you need to outshine her and you NEED to have the ponies of the world actively CHOOSE to elevate you to Queenhood." I smirked. "Just like a Mobster. You need that respect, or your victories would be as hollow as your heart."

Opaline: "M-My heart!?" She stepped back, NOW just realizing she was socially outmaneuvered.

K: "..you need love." I said, softly. "All Ponies do." I leaned over and - taking my lessons from Twilight herself - I hugged her around the neck.

She froze.

She'd never felt this before.

She'd never been accepted before.

She'd never once felt like someone cared about her, genuinely cared about her.

But, she could feel.. that I really, really did care about her, about her fate, and about her as a pony.

She froze.. and then leaned in, slumped in to me.

We slid down to the floor, and I just held her. After a minute, she started crying.

I called it perfectly - my instincts were coming back to me. Even if my body wasn't as powerful as it once was, my MIND was as sharp as it once was. I realized, looking into her and her motivations and actions, that as much as she wanted to see herself as superior to everypony, she was missing the most important thing in any pony's life.

Love.

She just wanted someone to love and care about her. It was part of the reason she absconded with Misty. It was part of the reason, I was sure, she'd been plotting devious acts for the last thousand years - she wanted to be adored by the masses, to replace the love she desperately desired.

She just didn't know how else to express it.

And with one act of genuine kindness, I broke her. I broke her resolve, already weakened by her need to protect and guard ponykind. She'd already let a little bit of concern and worry FOR OTHERS creep into her heart. I just finished it off.


TIME: 09:27 NERST


We came downstairs, and Opaline's eyeshadow was gone. She'd spent time crying, and we spent time talking. She confessed that ever since she decided SHE needed to be THE Guardian of Ponykind, she realized that she was all alone. That her heart hurt.

I admit, that if she hadn't started down this path, her heart would likely would have remained locked off from my kindness. She WOULD have been a Villain.. but the Umbrals made the situation different.

My instincts were on the mark.. I was becoming my old self again. It'd only taken about two weeks.

I sat next to Misty. She looked like she needed a friend, too.

Opaline: "Misty?" She sat on the other side of her. "I.. I want to apologize. For a lot of things." She said, in an uncharacteristically soft tone. "I.. confess.. that I rather absconded with you from your father. For very greedy reasons."

Misty: "O-Opaline?" She stammered.

Opaline: "Don't interrupt, my dear." She said softly. "I.. I've been alone for so long, even on Skyros, that.. I.. I wanted something of my own. I isolated you to I could have your attention all to myself. Your admiration. I was wrong - that is not how one makes friends. And as K has explained to me, the real magic we have, as Ponies... IS friendship. I was a fool, Misty." She lowered her head.

Misty, despite the apology, looked at me, then looked down, very sad.

K: "What's the matter?" I asked, looking to her.

Misty: "Opaline told me that once you arrived, if you arrived, my time here would be over." She shrugged a bit. "She's taught me so much!" She looked up, with a smile, nodding. "Opaline.. even.. if you think.. you did something bad somehow.. I learned so much from you. And.. and learning it.. it was fun." She sniffled a little. "I kinda don't want to leave. But, I know I have to." She shrugged.

Hitch: "You know your dad misses you a lot, right?" He tossed that into the fray.. and that got a cocked brow from both Zipp and Sunny.

Misty: "H-He does?" She blinked. "O-oh..." She looked down and away again. "I-I'm... sorry.." She shrunk into herself.

K: "No reason to be, Misty." I leaned my hand in, to offer touch, and she accepted, though timidly. I scratched her ears and mane a bit, and she seemed to relax.

Misty: "..never had that before.." She said, in low tones.

Opaline: "Misty, while you are gone, I expect you'll keep up with your studies." She cleared her throat a moment. "I'll.. go prepare something for you to travel with. You'll need supplies. No student of mine is leaving my sight without proper equipment."

She tried to get stuffy again, but the cracks in her cold heart, blown open by my offering of real friendship, made parting with her only companion for the last fifteen years, hard on her.

I gulped down the tea, and followed her.

K: "I'll give you a hand." I said, nodding to the others. As I passed by Sunny, I leaned in. "Misty is what we call on Earth a home-schooled kid. She's not used to lots of ponies. Be very gentle with her. Introverts need space. Their own space. Just make sure she knows you'll always be there for her."

Once I was in the Arcane Room with Opaline, I caught her tearing up again.

Opaline: "..I'm going to miss her, terribly." She said, putting things in a set of handmade leather saddlebags. "I did know you'd come. Rather, I had faith. Misty, though, was not my first student." She stopped, and turned to me. "I never realized I did this because I was a lonely mare. I thought.. well, what I thought." She heaved a sigh. "This.." She held up a chunky octagonal golden compact. "..is a two-way magical face to face communicator. No matter what, it should function. If you need me.." She slipped it in the saddlebags.

K: "I may very well need you, Opaline." I shrugged. "I mean as a part of my team, permanently. I don't know what I'll need to defeat the Umbrals."

Opaline: "You'll need the Sword of Rainbow's Light again, and the.." She blinked. "..I'll be frank, K. Without the Rainbow of Light itself, we can't destroy them."

K: "Not even a Daybreaker Device would work..?" I cocked a brow.

Opaline: "OH!" She chortled, derisively. "It'd work alright! And probably kill everyone in the process! If you used THAT against them, there's a very non-zero chance that the magical cascade feedback will cause the Ley Lines to simply detonate. Shatter the planet completely." She shook her head. "If only we'd still had the Rainbow." And sighed.

K: "We had it.. in the past." I blinked. "I used it to kill Tirek."

Opaline: "I am aware." She frowned. "It's the Legend, you know." She tilted her head to me. "You.. you never heard the full Legend, have you?"

K: "I.. have not. Only snippets, retold by different races over time." I shrugged.

Opaline: "There shall come a time of great darkness, when The Horned Bull returns to our lands, to cast and pull the Shadows once again. Whilst done, the TRUE shadows of darkness shall move and rise. A great fear griping the lands. Whereupon a Human shall appear. With him will come many lights. And he shall take upon the last ray of the Rainbow, and with it, fight the Darkness. The Human shall choose - either doom the world to immediate destruction under The Horned Bull, or save the world as a feast for the True Shadows." She frowned. "It didn't matter what you did - if you used the Rainbow on the Umbrals, Tirek would have destroyed you. If you used the Rainbow on Tirek.." She shook her head. "This is what you get."

K: "I was told I'd either doom the world or save it." I scowled. "It didn't say I would only save it for a thousand years."

Opaline: "The Legend was.. pretty clear. You were going to decide how we die. Immediately, under Tirek, or eventually, under the Umbrals." She scowled as well. "Honestly, I think Tirek would've been the better option. At least he didn't want to kill us all. There.. still would have been ponies.. left.. to.. fight against him. Overthrow him." She started tearing up. "The Umbrals did this on purpose - they made sure we'd have to make that kind of a choice!" And sniffled, as the tears came. "I don't blame you, K. You did what you thought was right - they made SURE of THAT!" She waved her hoof. "But now.. I don't know." She slumped to her butt.

K: "I absolutely refuse to believe this is a no-win scenario." I put my fists on my hips. "What if I'd killed Tirek some other way? HE could have been nuked with a Daybreaker!" I pointed.

Opaline: "Semantics. What's done is done." She lowered her head. "We can resist the Umbrals, and maybe save.. enough ponies.. to.. survive as a species. I might be able to summon enough magic to make the Ley Line Barriers much tighter and dome-like, but the world would be frightfully small." She wiped her snout. "I don't want to make that choice, K. But.. I'm the strongest Alicorn left alive." She snorted. "What else can I do?"

K: "What if I went back to the past and killed Tirek some other way?" I shrugged.

Opaline: "Time Travel Magic..!? It.. it's possible.. but.." She shook her head. "No, no, it's an idea." She nodded firmly to me. "The problem is.. figuring out the spell just right."

K: "So. We go back to the past and nuke Tirek with a Daybreaker. We'll have to bring it with us, too." I shrugged. "Have hope, Opaline. You're not just fighting a slowly losing battle, here. We can win." I nodded. "Tirek was supposed to be impossible, too, and WE beat him." I shrugged.

Opaline: "Perhaps you're right." She sighed, finishing loading the saddlebags. "You have given me much to think about, K."

I went over and hugged her again.

K: "We're friends, now, Opaline." I said, softly. "I think, together, we can save the world. I really hope I get to stay here when it's done, this time. I'd love to sit and learn more about the Arcane, from you. And bring you around and show you the world. So you're not isolated any longer." I shrugged a bit. "As it is, I'd like to run you back to Zephyr Heights. I want you to be by Theia's side." I wagged a finger. "As a real friend, this time."

Opaline: "Alright, K." She hugged me back, though she was a bit unsure. "I'll.. have to get used to making friends."

K: "Twilight was the expert." I nodded. "But, you'll do fine."

So, with that, I defused a potential situation, made a VERY powerful ally.. and met a timid, introverted mare that had every reason to shrink away and wall herself off, but was willing to put it all aside to help us.

She was kinda cute, too - she activated my protective side. I identified with her mentality, too, given that I was quite introverted myself after J's death.

Who knows what the future holds?

Part 4: Real Emotion

TIME: 14:30 NERST

LOCATION: Zephyr Heights, Greenbroke, New Equestria


When we got back to Zephyr Heights, we met with Theia. I explained everything to her. The full truth. Opaline confessed to her.... machinations, let's say. She made a full faith promise to make good and be a real friend, now.

We decided to have lunch there. With the greater military resources available to us, now, we could drive back to Bridlewood. Granted, the roads were... well.. almost nonexistent as roads, more like trails, but one of the LTV's would make short work of them. The primary LTV model holds all seven of us, with a bit of squish. It was tight but do-able with Opaline in, but I had to stand in the machine gun turret the whole ride back.

While I wanted to get the Unity Crystal united soon, I also wanted to take some time and let the team get to know each other more. Especially Misty.

I brought her, her lunch, in our official quarters - while we were gone, Haven had one entire wing of the Zephyr Palace dedicated to CAG and the defense effort. I was assigned some palace civilian staff to see to basic needs.

K: "Misty?" I entered slowly, with a full tray of various treats - I had no idea what she liked.

Misty: "O-Oh!" She stammered a bit. "Uhm. Come in?"

K: "Thanks." I came in and sat next to her. "Here, I brought you your lunch. I figured you'd had a lot of stimulation today, and you needed a break." I said, in soft tones.

Misty: "Thanks." She picked a few things, smiled, and started eating quietly.

I wouldn't press her for unwanted drivel. I ate as well, and periodically offered her other things that I found tasty. We didn't talk at all for over an hour.

Misty: "..I'm sorry, I'm really not used to other ponies." She blinked, then nodded. "Or humans!" She blushed slightly. "But, thank you. You seem to understand me. Kinda."

K: "More that I understand how your mind works. I've seen it before." Yeah, borderline autism, certainly agoraphobia, possibly a bit of depression, and certainly introvertedness. "So, I know what to do to comfort you."

Misty: "Wow." She looked at me, her eyes lighting up. "Opaline mentioned you sometimes, you know.. she talked about what she knew about you." She tilted her head. "Most of it was stories that Theia told her, but some of it was her watching from Skyros." She blushed slightly. "She.. she said you.. were popular."

I knew she didn't mean in a general sense. But, I immediately played it off that way.

K: "Thanks to Twilight Sparkle, I was able to really understand Friendship." I shrugged. "And I'm a friendly person. I like being around you Ponies, you all make me happy, and I want to protect that." I nodded.

Misty: "Opaline was..." She blinked. "...she made sure I always did my best. She always told me: 'Misty, if you're to have any hope against the darkness, you have to be the absolute best. You can't slack off, dear.'" She looked a bit sad, though.

K: "Why so sad, Misty?" I asked, softly.

Misty: "Well, everyone's friends already. I.. just.. feel.. out of place." She shrugged. "With me and Opaline, we had a system. A plan for every day. Now? I don't know." She looked up to me. "I don't know what's going to happen, now. And I'm kinda scared.. I WANT friends, but.. I don't know what to do."

K: "It's easy. Be yourself. Don't pretend to be something you're not, thinking you're going to impress them. A real friend will like you, no matter what." I nodded. "Like me. I like you, and I want to be your friend."

Misty: "Even though.. I-I don't know what to do?" She looked up at me, right in the eyes..

K: "That's fine. I'm not as old as Opaline, but, I have a lot of lived experience. I would love to teach you everything I can." I smiled to her.

Misty: "Thanks." She smiled, brightly.

I opened my arms, and she timidly accepted a hug from me. I'd give her a couple of days to get to know the others, but I was sure that she'd make those connections. She wasn't being forced into this, so, I'd rather she take it at her pace. She had skills and knowledge that we needed.

She just wasn't used to being around others. Or, for that matter, being hugged or touched very much. I could tell, though, that she wasn't entirely emotionally stunted, Opaline had clearly cared about her, but 15 years isolated with one person can make someone very unsure about accepting even basic hugs or handshakes from others.

Not to mention her desire to make friends, but not knowing how.

Still, she was frightfully smart, and I could see that. Deep down, there was a happy, caring Pony just begging to get out.


TIME: 08:14 NERST
DATE: Redemption Day 12/18 Septimus, 2054 C.S.


I woke up in Misty's room, with her draped across me. Unlike my antics a thousand years ago, I was clothed. Nothing happened. After lunch, we talked. I sent for supper, and we talked. I told her of my hopes, my dreams, my desires to save ponykind. Some of my life on Earth, too.

She told me of her tutelage under Opaline. The times they had. Fun, miniature adventures, her idea of craft days. It was clear Opaline put a lot of effort into training her, and her entire education and time there, was maximized, but at the same time, she showed her affection.

Misty thought of her more than just a teacher. She cared.

I absolutely knew that the nature of ponies, given the right situation, would shine through. They can't completely hate. There's always something in there that makes them a silly little pony.

As for us, I found myself caring about Misty. Moreso than just the friendship I felt in my heart for the others. I wanted to.. protect her?

Either way, we dozed off while talking. Zipp was the one to come in and let us know it was time for breakfast. She was already dressed in her AFSOC digital tiger stripe.

Zipp: "Heyyyy!" She leaned in, smiling. "You two talked a lot last night."

K: "Yeah, ah.." I shrugged. "..you guys took turns at the door, didn't you?"

Zipp: "Hey, not bad! And I thought -I- was the master detective." She smirked at me.

K: "She's young, innocent, and vulnerable. I don't know what dirty stories might've been passed around about me from a thousand years ago, but I would never take advantage of someone that's compromised - emotionally or otherwise." I shrugged, still talking softly.

Zipp came over and gently sat on the bed.

Zipp: "We're bros, right?" She smiled a bit.

K: "Yeah, I'd say so.." I smiled.

Zipp: "Sunny told me about.... you.. not having anyone. Call me paranoid, but..." She looked at me. "...you need someone. Even I know that." She nodded.

K: "I have you guys. I have Sunny. But, that's not what you mean." I shrugged. "I'm a two-time Widower, Zipp. Maybe I don't deserve to love like that again. I'm not going to force it, or chase it, it's just not in me any more. My pure love for all of you, that's enough for me."

Zipp: "Is it?" She cocked a brow. "Is it really? Or are you just fooling yourself?"

Misty stirred, slowly waking up, stretching herself out across my lap. She stretched kinda like a cat might. Then rolled over, and looked up at me, and at Zipp.

Misty: "Good morning!" She smiled. "Thanks for talking me to so much, K. You're right, I'll try my best. Friends are what I've always wanted." She looked at Zipp. "Friends?"

Zipp: "Like you have to ask." She leaned forwards and hugged her.

Misty: "Mmm!" She smiled broadly.

Zipp: "Come on, time for breakfast." She got up, and led the way downstairs.

I didn't know how on-the-nose Zipp might've been. She was smart, and she cared. She was a fascinating pony.. her detective skills weren't jut for crime, they were for emotions, too.

What a wonderful new generation of ponies. It was my honor to lead them.

Part 5: Alpha Actual

TIME: 10:27 NERST
DATE: Redemption Day 12/18 Septimus, 2054 C.S.
LOCATION: Departing Zephyr Heights, Greenbroke, New Equestria


We departed Zephyr Heights after breakfast. The trip would be about three hours. We'd stop in Cupcake Falls for lunch. The trip to Bridlewood was made easier by my newly re-affirmed position as General, and Commander-in-Chief. No longer and assumed authority, it was cemented in a podcast by Pipp, yesterday.

It was interesting, being in the vehicle with everyone. A bit tight, but we made it work. Just because I remembered the old lessons of the last war, we had some extra cargo tied to the sides and top. Field tools, extra ammo, water, and gas. We looked like a gypsy wagon, but it worked.

Pipp was wearing a camouflage uniform of her own creation. She loved Pink, so, the white flecks in her camouflage were, instead, a light pink color, and it had red little flecks in it, too. The base was the same dusky olive as the rest of us. Misty was in a plain olive drab uniform. Neither Pipp nor Misty carried firearms - they weren't trained, yet.

Zipp volunteered to train them both. That was fun. Given her time with AFSOC, I presumed she would be as decent of a trainer as Dusk had once been. She was tough, confident, and sure. I loved that about her. She did remind me a little of Rainbow Dash, but she was a lot different.

For one, she wasn't Lesbian. Tomboy? VERY much so. Idle flirt, too, the way she was leaning in on Hitch.

Zipp: "Man, I love these things." She said, taking a hard turn at about 72kph/45mph. "It's not flying, but it's FAST."

Pipp: "WHOA!" She almost dropped her phone. "Careful, Zipp!"

Hitch: "Yeah!" He put his forelegs to the roof. "Careful, that was a tight turn!"

Zipp: "Ehh, I got this." She smirked.

Sunny: "I've NEVER driven this fast before! I mean, I have rollerblades, but.." She cheered as we caught air. "OH YEAH! WOO HOO!"

Zipp: "SOME-body knows how to have fun." She laughed.

Lieutenant Gravels: C> "This is Lieutenant Gravels, Cupcake Falls militia. If anyone can read this, we have a CODE RED. Repeat, CODE RED! Any forces in the vicinity, respo-"

The radio cut out almost as soon as it sprang to life.

K: "Give me that." I grabbed the radio immediately. C> "Attention all New Equestria Forces, this is General K, callsign ALPHA ACTUAL. Any forces near Cupcake Falls, report in to me FIRST." I looked at Zipp. "Get us there."

Zipp: "Hang on, team!" She floored it.

Alphabittle: C> "Alpha Actual, this is One-Alpha. Task Force Dog and Task Force Baker are en route. Dog, MP platoon motorized, from the north. Baker, Rangers, from the south, one company."

Sheriff Cap: C> "Golf Echo One-One here. I'm sending two platoons of Gendarmes from Pitfield. Motorized, from the East."

K: C> "Alpha Actual to Dog Actual, Baker Actual, and Golf Actual. Rally point is Cedar Falls Pass. We go in together."

Dog Actual: C> "Dog Actual, roger."

Windy Whistles: C> "Baker Actual, Roger."

Golf Actual: C> "Golf Actual, roger, sir."

Zipp: "Hey, I know that voice - that's Windy." She smiled. "She's cool."

K: "Good." I nodded.


TIME: 11:21 NERST
LOCATION: Cedar Falls, Maresechusetts/Erie Border, New Equestria


We pulled up, and I was greeted with several LTV's and a heavy mechanized vehicle. It reminded me of a mutant Stryker with a CROWS turret.

Windy walked up to me, and saluted with her wing.

Sergeant-Major Windy Whistles: "Sergeant-Major Windy Whistles." She nodded to me. "New Equestria First Royal Rangers."

K: "My old team." I saluted back. "Everyone gather 'round."

The leaders of Golf and Dog teams got closer.

K: "I've been through Cupcake Falls. I know the layout. Have we had any communications from them?" I motioned for everyone to get closer - not just the team leads.

Windy: "No, sir."

Lt. Sun Sprinkles: "Lieutenant Sun Sprinkles, sir." He looked at Windy. "I'm the Golf Team leader.. and ranking-" He looked at Hitch. "-sorry, Sheriff."

Hitch: "No problem." He smiled.

Lt. Sun Sprinkles: "Still. General. You haven't been here for one thousand years. You're out of practice. You.. should.. let.." He looked at everyone, who was staring at him with 'you should shut up now' eyes.

K: "I expect you to follow my orders, Lieutenant, or I'll replace you with someone that will." I said, dismissively.

Lt. Sun Sprinkles: "..yes, General." He lowered his head.

K: "Windy, I need forward recon. Your best Squad, send them ahead and give us a report. The rest of us move in like so." I drew on the ground, in the dirt, showing the positions that I wanted them in. "Take your positions, wait for my order. Above all else, preservation of civilian lives is paramount. Things can be replaced, ponies can't." I nodded to them. "I want the mech vehicle stripped out and prepared to evacuate civilians." I pointed to it.

Lt. Sun Sprinkles: "You got it." He was reluctant at first, but he agreed to my orders.

To be honest, I expected some.. friction.

K: "I'll move in with my team, just behind the scout team." I pointed. "Alright, let's move."

As we got to our LTV, Sunny tugged my sleeve as she and the others got their Titan Mitts on.

Sunny: "Remember, Grandpa, you're not in shape for this, yet. Let us do the hard work." She nodded to me.

K: "Oh, I'll try." I shrugged, smirking. "No guarantees." I looked at Misty and Pipp. "Pipp, stay glued to your sister.. Misty, to me."

Misty: "Okay." She nodded.

Pipp: "On it." She smiled.

We moved in to take position. My worst fear was coming to light - that because I had returned, someone that declared them self my enemy, was going to kill innocent ponies because of me. The Battle of Cupcake Falls would be the first major fight in this war against the darkness, but it wasn't my first fight. Not by a long shot. Nor my last.

Whoever it was, though, they would soon learn, that General K.. was back.
