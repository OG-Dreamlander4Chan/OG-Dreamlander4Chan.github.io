February 14th, 1012 C.S.
09:37AM, Canterlot Royal Time
Dr. Fluttershy's Office, Canterlot


The clock ticked loudly, pounding in Dusk's head. He sat on the couch, head in his hands, as Dr. Fluttershy sat slightly behind and to the side of him, in the classic Freudian positioning. That ticking.. it was wearing on him. He finally looked up.

Dusk: "Is everything I say here, confidential?" He finally said, exasperated.

Dr. Fluttershy: "Everything. I'm the only one that will hear it, unless there's a court order." She shrugged. "Will there be?" She asked, since he'd know more about it than her.

Dusk: "..might be.." He muttered, looking down and away.

For once, he was not in uniform. He was in jeans, older jeans, a tanktop, and a loose outer shirt. His hair was a mess. He was unshaven. Things had taken a toll on him. He was wounded, but not bleeding.. not externally.

Inside, his life was turmoil. He wasn't sure which end was up, hence why he'd begged her last night to have an appointment with him. She'd agreed, hearing the pain in his voice.

Dr. Fluttershy: "...start at the beginning." She nodded, encouraging him.

Dusk: "Right.. the beginning." He frowned. "That's as bad as starting... anywhere else."


January 21st, 1012 C.S.
10:11 PM
Coxsaddle, Erie, Equestria


Dusk: "Six... on me." He motioned as they approached the target.

Master Sergeant Aullure Lunaire: "First section ready." She nodded, hefting her SMG.

First Sergeant Feather Nox: "Second section ready." He nodded.

Astral Sky: C> "TacTeam Seven in position." She called in over comms.

Chief Altern Darkening Stars: C> "Six and four, move in." He stated, simply.

Dusk, focused on the task at hand, rushed the side door to the building, and once in position, moved to provide cover. The Breacher for 1st Section, Corporal Sparkle Stars, moved up to the door, and set the breaching charge against it.

The team leaned back as the charge went off, knocking the door down. They moved in, at first, silently, until they heard the second charge go off, and TacTeam 7 enter the building.

Dusk: "NIGHTWATCH GUARD, MAKE YOURSELF KNOWN! MAKE YOURSELF KNOWN! WE HAVE A WARRANT!"

Both sections moved to clear each room, one at a time. There was no shoting, no movement, nothing. Occasional shouts from other guards - same words as Dusk - echoed occasionally, until Dusk and Astral met at the rally point, the 2nd floor landing.

Dusk: "We got nothing.." He shrugged.

Astral: "Same. Place is empty." She shook her head. C> "SEVEN! On me!"

Dusk: C> "SIX, Regroup!" He snorted. "I don't get it, our intel was on point."

Both teams assembled, and took defensive stances, and looked to their two commanders for orders.

Astral: C> "Command, this is Seven, we got nothing here." She snorted.

Darkening Stars: C> "Understood. Sweep the building one more time, look for evidence, watch for traps, then pack it in."

Dusk: C> "Roger, Command." He shrugged. "One, south side. Two, north.. first floor, go." He pointed.

Feather Nox: "Yes, sir." He nodded, and took his team.

Allure Luminaire: "Right away, sir." She motioned, and moved off with her team.

Astral's two sections moved off as well, leaving the two Team Leaders and their lead sections in the landing area.

Astral: "You know, I don't get it. The info was solid.. and there's nothing here. This is the second time." She frowned.

Dusk: "After this is over, I think I have someone I want to ask." He shrugged.


February 14th, 1012 C.S.
09:57AM, Canterlot Royal Time
Dr. Fluttershy's Office, Canterlot


The clock ticked loudly, still. Dusk stared at it, somewhat frustrated.

Dusk: "We didn't find anything. That wasn't the problem, though." He shrugged. "The problem was.. what came after."

Dr. Fluttershy: "It must've brought you a lot of pain..."

Dusk: "I..." He paused, hardly able to form the words. "..betrayed her..." He nodded, and continued...


January 21st, 1012 C.S.
11:51PM
Starlight's Apartment, Coxsaddle, Erie, Equestria


Dusk knocked. He was still dressed in most of his tactical gear, but not all of it. The armored vest was off, as was the tactical backpack, but he was still in the combat cargo pants, tactical shirt, and belt rigging, with drop thigh holster. Beret on, too..

Starlight: "Come on in..." She said, somewhat distractedly.

Dusk just opened the door. Starlight Glimmer was... totally nude, again. But, she was also bending over, folding laundry, from a basket on the floor. EVERYTHING was in sight...

Dusk immediately stared, eyes locked on everything out and presented. As Starlight looked down and back, between her rather luscious boobery, at him, she grinned.

Starlight: "Well, hello, G-Man." She said, in a rather sultry voice, standing up, and getting relatively serious. She turned on her heel, and shrugged. "To what do I owe the surprise? I mean, at THIS hour? I expected it to be you."

Dusk: "Mmmmmm...." He blinked several times. "...uh! Ah, I wanted.. to ask you some questions, if I could." He shrugged.

Starlight: "Ohhh..?" She leaned a bit towards him. "Is that... ALL you wanted?" She smirked.

Dusk: "Well, I.. yea.. ah.." He cleared his throat.

Starlight: "You don't sound convinced.." She made a half turn, and sat on the couch, crossing her legs, and grabbing her cigarettes, and lighting up.

Dusk: "Well..." He reasserted himself. "..I don't deny you're attractive, Starlight, but..." He shook his head. "..still engaged."

Starlight: "Oh, come off it, G-Man." She shrugged, and invited him to sit down. "Unlike Trixie and Rarity... -I- can keep up with you." She grinned, devilishly.

He did sit... and meeting her on her home turf without Trixie and Rarity in danger... changed things. It changed his mind set. It changed what he was thinking, how he was thinking. What he WANTED was information. What his brain wanted was.. well, it was starting to wander.

Dusk: "Yeah, well..." He shrugged a bit, and shook his head. "I need some information, again."

Starlight: "Let me guess...." She swivelled around so she was perpendicular on the couch.. and she teased her bare feet on his thigh just a bit. "...it's the raids you G-Men have been doing. All of them coming up empty, despite the good tips. Right?"

Dusk: "Stop that.." He put a hand on her foot, to make her stop flirting. "..and, yes. After Dr. Moon Dancer and everything, the Nightwatch is trying to be more aggressive."

Starlight: "So it seems." She nodded, smiling still. "I think I know where the issue is." She shrugged, getting serious. "You're going after what you think are Changeling terror cells. I'm pretty sure you're chasing ghosts."

Dusk: "Explain." He idly started stroking her foot.

Starlight: "Well, you see... I'm fairly certain those locations DID have cells at them at one time. Problem is, they've been gone for a while. I think ever since Hearthswarming, they've closed up shop and left to safer locations. The tips.. they've been saying they've seen strange people coming and going at those locations, yes?"

Dusk: "Yeah.." He didn't realize her foot was rubbing his thigh again.

Starlight: "If I'm correct, those are the clean-up teams. They sanitize the location, and they've been waiting and doing them one at a time, so by the time you boys get there, there's nothing to be found." She wasn't just rubbing his thigh, though, she was running the heel and side of her foot... somewhere else.

Dusk: "Starlight..." He cleared his throat, realizing what was happening.

Starlight: "Come off it, G-Man." She suddenly rotated forwards, and slid on to her belly, her head aaaallmost in his lap. "You've been wondering since we first met." She rest it on his lap, looking up at him. "And... privileged information, I know you already fucked Trixie again." She leaned up and poked his nose. "Rarity has no... iiii.. -dea..!" She giggled.

Dusk: "I thought you said you wouldn't blackmail me." He blinked down at her.

Starlight: "I'm not...." She bit her lip, and grabbed Dusk's hand... and....


February 14th, 1012 C.S.
09:57AM, Canterlot Royal Time
Dr. Fluttershy's Office, Canterlot


The clock ticked loudly.. was it getting louder? The weight of his sins bore heavily on Dusk's face, planted in his palms, and despite the cover, Dr. Fluttershy could see tears escaping.

Dr. Fluttershy: "..you had sex with her, didn't you?" She said, simply, with no judgment.

Dusk: "I.. WAS.. WEAK!" He suddenly said, hands ejecting from infront of his face, and waving wide. "I.. I can't believe it! I still.. STILL can't!" He waved around. "I didn't intend to! She just.. my hands... and.." He shook his head. "..before I knew it, I was waking up to a cheap breakfast muffin, and coffee. And ten texts from my boss, three from Rarity, five from Astral, and four from Trixie." He shook his head.

Dr. Fluttershy: "Ohh.. myyy.." She blushed a bit. "P-Please go on, if that's okay with you?"

Dusk: "That's why I came here." He sighed.


January 23rd, 1012 C.S.
11:16AM
Dusk's Apartment, Canterlot


Dusk had a day off, and he was using that to relax. He was stretched out on the couch, laying flat, trying to process his thoughts. He had a lot of them. He'd now cheated on Rarity twice, and she didn't know.. he knew that if she found out, they were through. No question. Trixie? Maybe. MAYBE. Starlight? HELL NO. No matter how he sliced it, he was FUCKED.

He was about to throw all of it away. He knew it. He knew he fucked up. Worse? He had no one to talk to. He couldn't talk to Rarity, not Trixie (since he'd CHEATED ON HER, TOO), and certainly not Starlight.

There was only one person he could turn to - one person that had no dog in this race, that would be honest with him, and was a friend. Astral Sky. He knew it, but, at the same time, he hated the idea of dumping his problems on her.

Indecision.

He rolled around on the couch for another hour. Then, finally, he reached for his cell phone.

{Text Message: Dusk (12:34)} meet me on roof with 6 pack

{Text Message: Astral (12:35)} Sounds serious bro yeah 5min

He sighed and got his shoes on, then trudged up the stairs to the roof of the apartment building. Astral was already there, leaning over the side.

Dusk: "I got no one else to talk to.." He started.

Astral: "Eh.." She shrugged, and handed him a beer.

Dusk: "You don't usually drink Kirin." He shrugged. "Special occasion?"

Astral: "Tryn'a cut back, yanno? So, I decided to make it too expensive to drink so much." She shrugged. "Tell me about it."

Dusk: "I.. I banged Starlight Glimmer." He cracked it open and sighed.

Astral: "WHOA!?" She lolled over and grinned.

For her part, she was dressed in a tank top and flannel pyjama pants, with sliders. VERY dressed down.

Dusk: "I was... I was weak, Astral." He sighed. "I feel like shit about it. I really do. AND I slept with Trixie." He shrugged. "Right after the big show. She... heh... got really forwards with me, and.." He shrugged, with a smile. "..it was as good as it always was. Maybe better. She fucked with confidence."

Dusk reflected on this, and smiled a bit. Trixie had been so very on point with the sex, it was honestly the best fuck session the two had ever had.

Astral: "Sounds like you're having doubts!" She meant about marrying Rarity.

Dusk: "..maybe, yeah.." He sighed. "I still feel like shit." He frowned, and drank the beer.. it was warm.

Astral: "I getcha." She patted his back. "Remember the time in the barracks?" She smirked.

Dusk: "Celestia's Mane, how could I forget? Trix and I had a fight, and you were all 'You look like a soldier that needs a clean weapon.'" He laughed, she laughed.

Astral: "Eh.. I figured we wouldn't work out, but.." She gestured. "It was still fun." She smirked.

Dusk: "Yeah, it was." He shrugged back. "I don't know, Astral.. I like all three of them for differnet reasons.."

Astral: "Yeah." She slid up to him, and put her arm around him. "And now, you screwed the Griffon. You cheated on your side piece. You know once Rarity finds out, you two are through. Trixie? I'unno."

Dusk: "I know. I know. I-I don't want to throw that away, you know? But I feel like I did. I love them. I don't know what to do next." He sipped the beer again, and shrugged, then chugged it.

Astral: "Eh. Lemme make things a bit harder." She slid her arm down and groped his ass. GROPED, with her strong, toned hands.. "I still like you, Dusk. A lot. I wouldn't mind fraternizing, now that we're the same rank again."

Dusk: "A-Astral!" He stammered, and gripped the beer can so hard, he crushed the empty in his hand.

Astral: "Lemme remind you.. how to clean your rifle, soldier..."


February 14th, 1012 C.S.
10:14AM, Canterlot Royal Time
Dr. Fluttershy's Office, Canterlot


The clock ticked loudly.. pounding in his ears. He had to hold his hands over them. It was almost painful. Was it psychological? Was.. something else wrong? He didn't know.

Dr. Fluttershy: "You didn't!" She was a bit surprised.

Dusk: "I never.. I mean.. we did it once, but I was really fully single at the time, and it was two soldiers.. and.." He shook his head. "We did everything on that roof. I had... never... she was so physical, so intimate, and she knows me so well, too." He heaved a sigh, rubbing his face with his hands. "It was so much better than the first time we did it."

Dr. Fluttershy: "Mhm... and how did you feel after that?" She asked, looking up from her clipboard of notes.

Dusk: "Like shit. Even worse. Ten times worse. She's a team-mate! She's.. I really like her as a person, and.. that ASS.." He smiled a bit.

Dr. Fluttershy: "Do you regularly have problems with fidelity?" She probed.

Dusk: "..kinda? I mean, I admit, I have wandering eyes sometimes. I have feelings for Trixie. Strong ones. Which reminds me.." He continued his story..


January 26th, 1012 C.S.
6:22PM
Dusk's Apartment, Canterlot


Trixie was taking a day off from the hospital, and looking for other employment. While she enjoyed the foals, it was emotionally draining on her to keep doing this. She couldn't do it every day, but she promised herself that she'd go at least once a week, but she needed more regular customers, so, she was trolling through the entertainment section of the paper, and making notes for future phone calls.

She was also wearing nothing but panties and a tank top while she did it. Dusk was home from work for the day after another failed raid, and had just taken a shower. He was coming out wearing nothing but a towel, and saw her.. in her state of dress. Messy hair, casual style, comfortable and comforted demeanor, and his mind went immediately domestic. Like, this is something that could be - him Guarding, her Entertaining, and the two of them being together. Nothing fancy, nothing high society, just a pair of working stiffs.

Dusk: "Hey, Trixie.. you look real good." He smiled at her. "I'm.. glad you're here."

And he got stiff, just thinking about it.

Trixie: "Oh? Huh.." She looked up, smiling. "And here I thought my Great and Powerful Charisma was the only thing that got you going." She locked eyes with him, and stretched, arcing her back, and letting her breasts stick out.

Dusk: "Maybe I'm just thinking about things.." He shrugged. "..stuff I probably shouldn't, but I am anyway." He paced over to where she was, without shame, but with some desire to see if this would go all the way.

Trixie: "You and Rarity are a thing, still." She said, softly, looking up into his eyes. "But we go back a long way. Dusk, I really need you.. I have for a very long time."

The towel dropped, and Trixie grabbed him, pulling him into her...


February 14th, 1012 C.S.
10:21AM, Canterlot Royal Time
Dr. Fluttershy's Office, Canterlot


The clock ticked loudly.. he was getting a headache.

Dusk: "I mean, having sex with her again wasn't so bad. It was something.. I mean.. I do have feelings for her. I.. I don't know where they are or what they are, but every time I think about us together, it makes as much sense as me and Rarity." He shook his head. "I remember as I held her, feeling how perfect every curve of her body was, and how well it fit to me. It was like finding a special rhythm. Some special groove, or.. something. I'm not sure how to put it into words."

Dr. Fluttershy: "And... you said her body was perfect..." She almost asked, but inferred.

Dusk: "Yes.." He smiled a bit.. then it.. something in him felt a doubt about something. "Wait.." He blinked.

Dr. Fluttershy: "You need to continue." She pressed him.

Dusk: "Do I?" He blinked, and looked at her. "I mean, I suppose I do.. for it all to make sense."

Dr. Fluttershy: "Yes.. it needs to make sense." She nodded slowly.


January 31st, 1012 C.S.
2:04PM
Dusk's Apartment, Canterlot


Rarity: "You know, Dusk.." She said, strolling in from the kitchen. "..I have to ask you about your recent shiftiness." She was being direct.

Dusk was afraid of this, given what had happened several times over the last couple weeks. Even more so when Rarity said they needed to have a long talk about what they'd be doing in the future, and offered to bring him dinner. It was Khyangese food from the Parks' restaurant. That and a bottle of Khyangese rice wine.

Dusk: "...yeah.." He was in jeans and an old training T-Shirt with the Royal Guard print on it. "Listen, Rarity.."

She sat next to him, herself wearing a tanktop with a print of her cutie mark on it, and a nice pair of slacks. She had worn pinheels over here, and a nicer top, but she'd shed them once she got into the apartment. Flirtatious but not outright slutty.

Rarity: "Yes, dear?" She smiled, handing him his food.

Dusk: "I'm... I have to confess to something." He frowned, and lowered his head. "I'm.." He sighed. "..Trixie and I.."

Rarity: "I understand you have some feelings for her, dear." She sighed. "It's something I've understood for a long time."

Dusk: "You don't know, though." He shrugged. "You don't know everything.. we..." He put his food down, and took her hands into his, making her look at him. "Rarity, I.. I slipped." He lowered his head. "I was... we..."

Rarity: "Oh." She nodded, but leaned in and kissed him. "It's alright, dear. I kind of expected it to happen when she showed up." She shrugged, and smiled into his eyes.

Dusk: "I'm glad.. you're okay with this.." He shrugged. "I can't tell you how it's been eating me up."

Rarity: "It's fine, dear. You have a lot of love to give." She put her hand on his cheek. "It's... understandable that you'd give Trixie some of that love."

Dusk: "You're not mad?" He tilted his head.

Rarity: "I'm not the happiest mare in Equestria, but I understand, dear." She slid ito his lap. "But, you're mine. That's what's important. That's what matters to me.. you're mine and mine alone at the end of the day."

Dusk: "You know your eyes are so pretty, Rarity." He smiled at her. "I could lose myself in them forever." He ranh is hand over cheek, and stared deeply into her emerald irises.


February 14th, 1012 C.S.
10:21AM, Canterlot Royal Time
Dr. Fluttershy's Office, Canterlot


The clock ticked loudly.. he rubbed his ears as he heard it tick, pounding in his head.

Dusk: "..wait, her.." He blinked.

Dr. Fluttershy: "Go on." She nodded... still pressing him.

Dusk: "Rarity's eyes aren't green." He blinked.

Dr. Fluttershy: "Aren't they?" She asked, pressingly.

Dusk: "They're blue!" He looked at the clock as it ticked.

Dr. Fluttershy: "You're certain." She stated, but almost questioned.

Dusk: "They are.. they're the most perfect shade of blue I've ever stared into." He grew reflective. "Wait.. wait wait wait...." He looked at Dr. Fluttershy.

Dr. Fluttershy: "You need to keep going." She grew insistant.

Dusk: "But, I-" He blinked, and shook his head. "-do... yes."


February 4th, 1012 C.S.
3:13PM
Dusk's Apartment, Canterlot


Starlight was over. She lounged on his bed, post-coitus, absolutely naked, as Dusk made them something to eat in the kitchen. Cheese quesadillas. Nothing special.

Starlight: "That was amazing G-Man." She giggled to herself. "I didn't think I'd get a second helping. Much less get over to your place to do it."

Dusk: "Eh, Rarity doesn't care.. she said so. I have a lot of love to give, and she says she doesn't have a problem if I spread it around." He shrugged.

Starlight: "Oh, how very charitable of her. She really is very generous, you know." She rolled in bed, and moved to filing her nails a bit, with an emory board.

Dusk came in and handed her a plate, before sliding into bed next to her. He groped her ass lewdly, knowing that with her, he could get DIRTY. Like, even dirtier than with Trixie. And that was something that turned him on. He stared into her twin emerald abysses and smirked.

Dusk: "You're filthy." He chuckled. "I never thought you'd enjoy being tied up or any.. any of that other stuff.."

Starlight: "Oh?" She gave him a cheeky grin. "Maybe I'm kinkier than you ever imagined. That's kinda what you want, out of me, right? A filthy ex-criminal mare that likes to be caught by her big, strong Guard, and.. detained.. subdued.. submitting to you." She trailed that off with the lustiest inferences.

Dusk: "Oh, yeah, and then some." He smiled. "Kinky as fuck, just as I imagined you." He caressed her face, losing himself in her eyes again.


February 14th, 1012 C.S.
10:21AM, Canterlot Royal Time
Dr. Fluttershy's Office, Canterlot


The clock ticked loudly.. Dusk was really starting to get pissed off at it. He rubbed his head.

Dusk: "And I remember how kinky she liked it. It was like every fantasy I ever had about her in the back of my mind, was brought out and front and center with her." He sighed hard... and stared at the clock. "What gets me, though.. I remember now... Starlight's eyes are blue, too." He shook his head. "Why do I remember her eyes being green?"

Dr. Fluttershy: "And you say, her actions in bed were the kinkiest things you ever imagined her doing." She stated, not asked.

Dusk: "Yes, yes it was." He smiled a bit. "Hair pulling, handcuffs, rope, flank slapping, the whole bit. WAAAY filthier than Trixie.. I have to admit.. I enjoyed it." And chuckled. "It was way beyond anything I'd ever done before."

He then froze. And blinked several times.. shaking his head, and wagging a finger.

Dr. Fluttershy: "You. Need. To. Keep. Going." She stated firmly.

Dusk: "I do." He blinked. "I do."


February 7th, 1012 C.S.
4:15PM
Astral's Apartment, Canterlot


Astral, now. He as in bed with her, having just finished up.. they were spooning. The sex had been firm, but mutually pleasurable, as though they understood initmately what moves the other was going to make, before they made them, and respected each others' needs on a level only possible when you've put your life in the other's hands more than once.

Astral: "Mmm.. you keep this up, soldier, we're going to have to get a bigger barracks." She giggled a bit, and let her wings twitch against his chest. "I have to say, I really.. really feel safe with you. Like, I know you're going to be there for me, every time." She sighed, and cuddled his arm. "Would it be so bad?"

Dusk: "I mean, Rarity doesn't care. She said I had a lot of love to give.." He sighed. "..I don't know, though, Astral. The sex was amazing.. sweet Celestia was that ever amazing.. but, I can't."

Astral: "Can't what?" She rolled over to be face to face with him. "Give me another round?" She kissed him. "Come on, soldier, holster that weapon."


February 14th, 1012 C.S.
10:21AM, Canterlot Royal Time
Dr. Fluttershy's Office, Canterlot


The clock ticked loudly.. finally, Dusk shot up from his seat, and slapped the sides of his head.

Dusk: "Can't you hear that ticking?!" He finally said. "Sweet Celestia, it's like a-a-a pounding drum in my head!"

Dr. Fluttershy: "Sit down." She said, rather sternly. "Please."

Dusk: "...yeah, yeah.." He sat down, and rubbed his head. "..sorry, Doctor."

Dr. Fluttershy: "It's alright. This has been very stressful." She said, reassuringly. "But, you're almost there. Almost, Dusk. You need to keep going."

Dusk: "I do?" He said, dazed, shaking his head. "I guess.. I do."

Dr. Fluttershy: "You never gave in, did you?" She asked.

Dusk: "Gave in.. to what?" He blinked.

Dr. Fluttershy: "Truly betraying Rarity.." She lead him on.

Dusk: "No.. I would.. I would never betray her. I love.. I love her with all my heart. She.. said I had a lot of love to give.." He blinked.

Dr. Fluttershy: "What happened next?" She implored him.

Starlight: "You love me, don't you?" She asked, tugging on his arm. "Come on, G-Man. I'm clearly the best choice."

Trixie: "Dusk! We've been together before. You know how good I am!" She grabbed his other arm. "I love you, Dusk! I love you so much. I'm sorry I'm not as successful as Rarity!"

Astral: "Come on, Soldier. I'm clearly the best choice." She slid up behind him, draping herself over him. "I'm the strongest, I'm the fastest, and we've been together as soldiers for a long time.. a very long time.. you know how good I am."

Dusk: "Really, girls, you.. you're all so amazing." He said, trying to give each of them some of his touch. "Each of you. So pretty, so.. so hot.. so wonderful.." He was swirling around with each of them. Almost dancing.

Rarity: "DUSK!" She called out from a distance.

Dusk: "Ra-Rarity?" He stammered.

Starlight: "Oh, come on, ignore her. She's nothing. She doesn't deserve all your love. I do." She licked the side of his face.

Trixie: "No, Dusk. Me. You love me." She kissed his lips passionately.

Astral: "Come on, Soldier! You know who's best." She gave his neck a little nip.

Rarity: "DUSK, SPEAK TO ME!" Her voice.. was an echo..

Dusk: "Rarity?" He pushed the other girls away. "RARITY! WHERE ARE YOU!?"

Rarity: "Dusk! DUSK! SPEAK TO ME, PLEASE, DARLING!"

Dusk: "Rarity?" He felt the other girls grabbing him, but he struggled, hard, to break free. "RARITY!" He screamed.

The clock ticked loudly.. Dusk was holding himself. Something had happened. He couldn't figure out what it was, but something had happened. No WAY all three of them would act like that! He was.. his head hurt.. he stood up, and tried to walk around the room, but couldn't move.

Dusk: "Doctor..." He said, suddenly. "Wh... Something happened, didn't it?" He looked back at her.

Dr. Fluttershy: "Did it?" She asked, plainly, staring at him.

Dusk: "It did.. there's no way those three would act that way with each other. Why were they trying to get me to betray Rarity and fall in love with them?!" He asked, finally, looking right at her.

Dr. Fluttershy: "Do you recall what happened, next?" She asked, simply..

Dusk: "..I.." He paused. Did he? What was going on here? "I... think..."

Rarity: "DUSK, PLEASE! PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF CELESTIA, DARLING, SPEAK TO ME!" Her voice, while echoed, was in sobs and tears.

The woman he loved so very much, was in pain. Serious pain. And he couldn't find her. Dusk then realized that he was.. somewhere that was nowhere at all.. the whole world swirled around him.. dark green energy...

???> "YOU DON'T LOVE HER! YOU. LOVE. ME!"

That voice was a cacophany of Astral, Starlight, and Trixie all at once.

Dusk: "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I LOVE RARITY! I. LOVE. RARITY! NO! I WAS WEAK. I WAS WEAK, BUT I LOVE RARITY WITH ALL MY HEART! RARITY!? RARITY! WHERE ARE YOU!?" He screamed, his lungs burning with the effort.

Sgt. Spirit Ebonwave: "..talking.. moving.. keep..."

That.. that was a voice that should not be. TacTeam 6's medic. Something was very, very wrong.

Dusk: "RARITY!!!! WHERE ARE YOU!?"

Sgt. Spirit Ebonwave: "..to him..! Keep.."

Rarity: "DUSK, DARLING! DUSK! WAKE.. UP!"

The clock ticked loudly.. but.. the ticking.. wasn't ticking, was it?

Dusk: "I was.. rescued.." He blinked. "Wait.." He stood up again, and looked at Fluttershy. "No, no, no.. no.. this.. that ticking.. can you hear it?!"

Dr. Fluttershy: "So, you do recall." She nodded. "You remember hearing her voice."

Dusk: "YES! I REMEMBER, CELESTIA-DAMNIT! WHAT HAPPENED!? WHAT HAPPENED NEXT!?" He became angry.. very, very angry..

..the ticking.... it wasn't ticking at all...

Dr. Fluttershy: "Can you... accept what you did?" She finally asked.

Dusk: "Accept?!" His wind was knocked from im and he sat down. "I.. I love Rarity so much... but.." He finally started breaking down, sobbing.. "...I WAS WEAK! I CHEATED! I DON'T DESERVE HER! I DON'T DESERVE ANYONE! I FAILED! I FUCKED UP!"

Dr. Fluttershy: "If she truly forgave you, could you accept that you're just pony, like the rest of us? Not perfect, but doing your best?" She implored.

Dusk: "...yes! YES, OH, LUNA, YES! I'M SO SORRY, RARITY! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!" He bawled.

Dr. Fluttershy: "Then.. wake up."

The ticking... it wasn't ticking at all. It was BEEPING! IT WASN'T A CLOCK, IT WAS AN EKG MACHINE!

Canterlot Royal Memorial Hospital, Intensive Care Room 11


Dusk shot up from the bed, into a seated position. He gasped a hard breath, and looked around the room. Rarity. Dr. Fluttershy. Trixie. Starlight. Astral. Misty Stars... and Twilight Sparkle. Her horn had been glowing, but it died down as he woke up.

Minister Sparkle: "..that was amazing, Doctor. I didn't think you could pull that off." She smiled a bit.

Dr. Fluttershy: "Ohh.. myyyy..." She woozily held her head. "...you're right, Rarity, he does love you." She blinked a bit.

Dusk: "Wh-" He looked at all of them again, as Rarity came over, and hugged him, literally crawling into bed with him.

Rarity: "My Darling!" She kissed him.

Minister Sparkle: "Ah.. Dusk. You're very lucky, you know? My brother barely survived his encounter with her." She nodded.

Dusk: "What happened!?" He finally said.

Astral: "You went missing the night after our second raid. We scoured the whole state looking for you. Starlight helped - she knew some strange people were moving stuff around, from some of her underworld contacts." She shrugged, as Starlight grinned. "We rescued you last night from some dingy run-down abandoned building in White Plains." She patted his arm. "The leader of the bugs got away, though."

Dusk: "What.. happened... to ME, though?" He looked at Rarity.

Minister Sparkle: "As near as we can understand, the Queen of the Changelings tried to get you to betray us all, by falling in love with her. She tried to do something similar to my brother." She shrugged. "But, your solid love for Rarity.. it kept you from betraying us."

Dusk: "And.. the.. therapy session.." He continued.

Minister Sparkle: "That was me, putting Dr. Fluttershy into your mind, to help you work through everything. You apparently felt so guilty about it all, you refused to wake up. You were catatonic." She shrugged. "We had to figure out why."

Rarity: "..speaking of, I do forgive you, Darling." She kissed Dusk's cheek. "Trixie confessed." She snuggled into him. "I'd be mad, but.. knowing that.. my love.. is what kept you alive? I know where your heart is."

Minister Sparkle: "The only way to wake you up was to get you to work through your guilt. I'm.. sorry if it was a bit rough, but she had you entranced, and.." She shrugged. "..made you see illusions as she.. did things.. with you."

Dusk: "..oh." He blinked. "Wow." And shook his head. "I'm.. I'm going to need some time to process all of this."

Dr. Fluttershy: "Yes, you will. You have two weeks medical leave, and an appointment with me every other day." She said, softly. "That's just an evaluation."

Dusk: "I.. don't know... what to say." He shrugged..

Astral: "Eh, don't worry about it. By the way, when did you figure out everything was fake?" She tilted her head.

Dusk: "Well, you see..."
