January 17th, 1012 C.S.
8:00PM
Grand Amphitheatre Grounds - Main Stage

Trixie was dressed in a black version of her usual outfit - black singlet, black fishnets, black pleated female suit pants, black cape, black magician's hat, the last two all with red stars and planets decorated across them, and a quick splash of red and silver glitter across her face.

She strode out slowly, confidently, with her heels clicking on the stage floor, echoing, as the crowd fell silent.

Trixie: "LADIES AND GENTLECOLTS!" She yelled out, swinging the microphone close to her face. "YOU.. were expecting the Dazzlings, right?" She held the mic towards the crowd.

They cheered for their favorite band. She smiled, nodded, and held up her other hand, rotating it at the wrist to encourage them to hype it up a bit.

Trixie: "Welll..!" She brought the mic back close to her face. "Just.. one little problem."

There were boos. Lots of boos.

Trixie: "Settle down, settle down.." She made placating gestures towards the crowd. "..the PROBLEM is.." She stepped back a bit, and made a partial bow. "..they're TRAITORS! And were ARRESTED! For trying to hypnotize Princess Luna!" She pointed to the Princess in her balcony seat.

The crowd's mood was a bit negative, but not at the situation, more at the possibility that someone would endager the Princess. Chants started of "LU-NA! LU-NA! LU-NA!"

Trixie: "Calm down! Calm down..!" She tried to get the crowd under control, but they were starting to get really whipped up into a frenzy.

Luna: "BE STILL!!" She shouted from her balcony seat, louder than the speakers.

Everyone settled down.

Trixie: "But, don't worry!" She paced across the stage. "YOU paid for a BIG show, you're going to GET ONE!"

The crowd cheered.

Trixie: "Now, I know they just performed at the start of the night, but.. once again.. let me introduce.. MY LITTLE ROMANCE!"

Stage light shifted back towards the back part of the stage, illuminating Galloway Hay, Ray Trotto, Martingale Hay, and Flank Irons. A new song started tuning in.

Galloway Hay: "This song was written in twenty minutes.. by the mare that saved us." He leaned back and smiled at the crowd.

Trixie was shadowed in a light ring, so the light was not directly illuminating her. She was in shadow.

("My Little Romance - The Great & Powerful" - 2025; PrinceWhatever, 4EverfreeBrony, MelodyBrony. Edits by Dreamlander)

Trixie (Singing): "Now it's wet and it's cold, station wagon's a mess..
..I was run out of town it's been hard I confess..
..Have a smoke and a drink and some pills for the stress..
..If I look like I'm crying I'm really just trying to smile.."

Trixie & Galloway (Singing): "All alone but it's better this way..

Trixie (Singing): "There's no reason to stop and no reason to stay..
I can be your friend just for tonight if you pay..
But I give you fair warning I'm gone in the morning my love.."

Galloway (Singing): "Another night..
..and another crowd to pull.."
Trixie & Galloway (Singing): "So let's show them Trixie..
The great and powerful...!"

Trixie & Galloway (Singing): "Give 'em a show to remember!
We're gonna leave 'em all cheering in a daze!"

Trixie (Singing): "They say that I'm a pretender?
But a magician never reveals her ways!
A light so bright it will blind you!
There ain't a pony as powerful as me!
So pray that Trixie can't find you!
Called me a fraud but I beg to disagree!"

Trixie (Shouting): "Abra-ca-DABRA!"

This set off a shower of quickly-placed firework bottle rockets - set up by TACTEAM 6's EOD Watcher, triggered by Dusk.

Galloway (Singing): "There's a room in the back where the VIPs go.."

Trixie (Singing): "You can come find me there maybe after the show!
If you buy me a drink I can offer a dance..
But it takes more than vodka to take off my pants, Romeo!"

As he sang the last line, she tore her pants off to reveal her fishnet stockings, and did a twirl across the stage, ending next to Galloway.

Galloway (Singing): "Another night..
..and another crowd to pull.."

Trixie & Galloway (Singing): "So let's show them Trixie..
The great and powerful...!"

Trixie & Galloway (Singing): "Give 'em a show to remember!
We're gonna leave 'em all cheering in a daze!"

Trixie (Singing): "They say that I'm a pretender?
But a magician never reveals her ways!"

Trixie glided across the stage to the middle.

Trixie & Galloway (Singing): "A light so bright it will blind you!"

Trixie (Singing): "There ain't a pony as powerful as me!
So pray that Trixie can't find you!
Called me a fraud but I beg to disagree!"

As the band played the instrumental section, a huge rocket firework raised from the stage between her legs, which she straddled. Her dark-lipstick'd lips gavfe a sharp, almost evil grin to the crowd.

Trixie & Galloway (Singing): "Give 'em a show to remember!
We're gonna leave 'em all cheering in a daze!"
They say that I'm a pretender?
But a magician never reveals her ways!
A light so bright it will blind you!
There ain't a pony as powerful as me!
So pray that Trixie can't find you!
Because this filly still has tricks up her sleeve!"

All Band (Singing): "Waaa-ohh-waa-ohh-ohh.."

The firework lit up its fuse, and as the band vocalized, it ignited, and fired off, as the song continued to play. While the rocket was attached to a wire guidance system, Trixie herself was attached to a harness. The rocket fired, and arc'ed out of the stadium, seeming to carry Trixie off with it. In truth, as soon as it vanished into the darkness, it was released from its wire guidance, and Trixie simply let go.

Trixie was lowered to the very rim of the Ampitheatre's main crowd area, and got herself off of the crane and harness, as the rocket exploded into a huge firework burst.

Dusk: "You know, T.O.W. Missiles cost about half a million Bits, each, right?" He smirked as he helped her get detached, and onto the zip like to make her reappearance.

Trixie: "Yeah, but I'm worth it." She smirked. "The GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie.. cannot be stopped." As she got on to the zip like, she reached out with an arm, lasso'd him, and kissed him on the lips.

That was more than a friendly kiss.

She let go of him, and zip-lined to the back stage area, with the Amphitheatre lights carefully hiding her. She was behind set and stage architecture and curtains in a few moments.

Just as the song ended, another massive firework and, now, smoke burst in the center of the stage, timed with the lights dimming and hiding the band, Trixie reappeared.

The crowd erupted as she reappeared. Trixie, for the first time in her life, felt amazing. She felt adored. Loved. Like she ALWAYS SHOULD HAVE BEEN! She bowed, and kissed to the crowd a bit, grabbing the mic again.

Trixie: "Short intermission, everyone! THEN! COLORATURA!" She cheered for her, her newest friend.



8:24PM
Backstage


Coloratura: "This is going to be fantastic." She smiled, and hugged Trixie, who did a quick change into a slightly matching outfit to Coloratura.

Coloratura was in a dark purple gown with a lot of colored frills to it. Trixie switched to her other singlet, which matched the tone and was made of a cheaper version of the same kind of fabric, so that even under stage lights, they'd look almost identical. She kept her fishnet sleeves on, though, since Coloratura's arms were in fine mesh sleeves. She added a silver necklace to match Coloratura's silver-accented choker.

It was a complimentary match, meant to make Coloratura look the most important, but like they were part of a set.

Trixie: "For the first time in my life, Coloratura, I feel amazing." She smiled. "I even kissed my ex." She winked.

Coloratura: "Yeah.." She smiled, half-closing her eyes. "..you think maybe you deserve him, now?" She stabbed at her.

Trixie: "WH-WHAT?" She looked shocked.

Coloratura: "Come on - I've seen this before. You felt like shit, like you didn't deserve a fine stallion like him, so you acted like a piece of shit, to get him to break up with you. Right?" She tilted her head.

Trixie: "..y-yeah.." She slowly lowered her head.

Coloratura: "So? Stop. You deserve him - you always did. Take your shot." She smirked.

Trixie: "He's getting married!" She hissed. "G-Granted, the wedding was put off because of the recent events.. but.." She shrugged.

Coloratura: "Fuck that. Homewreck. He was yours first, wasn't he?" She smiled at her.

Trixie: "Y.. yeah! YEAH! He was! I deserve a real chance!" She puffed up her two traitors and put her fists on her hips.

Sven: "TWO MINUTES TO CURTAIN! MOVE YOUR ASSES, FILLIES!" He demanded.

Coloratura: "Think about it, Trixie. Seriously. You're beyond awesome. You deserve that chance - that REAL chance." She tugged her arm. "Let's go.." She gave Sven a falsely polite smile. "And earn Sven what he deserves."

Sven just smirked, confidently.


8:30PM
Main Stage

Cheers and applause as they came on stage. Trixie was way behind Coloratura, letting her take the bows as her fans thronged to the stage side, trying to get her to touch their hands.

Trixie hung back, smiling.

Finally, she got to her Piano, and Trixie took her place nearby to do the backing vocals.

Coloratura started tuning up, and suddenly leaned into the Mic. What she said, sent the crowd from excitement to confusion.

Coloratura: "I wrote something BEAUTIFUL for you all, tonight. But my MANAGER said it wouldn't SELL.." She smacked her lips, and looked towards the offstage area.

Sven.. went white. Faint. Like he knew something was up. But, he couldn't stop this, even if he wanted to. Trixie had the crowd's favor, and interrupting both her and Coloratura would be a disaster for the brand.

The Brand that he'd WORKED SO FUCKING HARD TO MAKE AND KEEP FAMOUS.

His eyes burned lasers, as though he was watching someone soak all of his possessions in gasoline, and stood next to them with a lit match.

Coloratura: "So, I have something ELSE for you, instead!" She smiled, and nodded to Trixie.

("Pop Song" - 2025, BGM Pony Degeneracy)

Coloratura (Singing): "I don’t care about a single damn thing I say..
It’s just another empty track, so that I get paid!
Make the beat dance, add a little romance.
Make the colts feel like, they got a chance, singin’..

''I fuckin’ love you and I think you’re fuckin’ great'' and..
''The mares at school are wrong about you, let’s have a date!''
Really I don’t wanna profit off a bunch of horny teens!
But the manager says, it’s the way shit’s been for the..

pop song, it’s time to rock on, rock on.
I’m standing tall like the brightest pawn..
I guess the stage is where I belong?
So everypony sing along with the motherfuckin'..

Pop song, we play the.. long con-long con..
Could popularity be so wrong?
When creativity is.. all gone-all gone..
It’s time to rock on, with another pop song."

She slammed the keys with her fingers, playing with her whole heart. Despite her stoicism, her eyes started misting up.

Coloratura (Singing): "It’s the same damn bullshit every single day!
Fill a quota, be a droplet in the musical wave.
What happened to me, the pony I used to be?
The one that played from the heart… the one that was free?

It’s not the same as before, it’s not enough anymore!
A little mare with her piano wouldn’t call for an encore!
The veil comes down, and you cheer and stare!
But who FUCKING CARES… *Slamming discordant note* -about a..

pop song, it’s time to rock on rock on!"

(Trixie, backing): "Rock ooooooon!"

Coloratura (Singing): "I’m standing tall like the brightest pawn.."

(Trixie, backing): "Brightest paaaaaawn!"

Coloratura (Singing): "I guess the stage is where I belong?"

(Trixie, backing): "Where I beee loooongg!"

Coloratura (Singing): "So everypony sing along with the motherfuckin'..


Coloratura (Singing): "Pop song, we play the.. long con-long con..

(Trixie, backing): "Long cooooooooooon!"

Coloratura (Singing): "Could popularity be so wrong?"

(Trixie, backing): "Be so wrooooooong?"

Coloratura (Singing): "When creativity is.. all gone-all gone.."

(Trixie, backing): "All gone, all gone, rock on, rock on.."

Coloratura (Singing): "It’s time to rock on, with another pop song."

At this point, with tears streaming down her snout, Coloratura bolted up from her piano bench, and SLAMMED her fists into the piano keys. This produced a massively dischordant slam of notes.

Coloratura: "FUCK IT! I'm done. Thanks for coming out tonight." She gave a dismissve wave to the crowd, who suddenly started cheering.

Watching them light up, electrify, scream, and cheer.. it hurt. Badly. Inside, she felt that last bit of herself die. She glared at them with complete contempt, and spite.

Coloratura: "OF COURSE you all loved it!" She sneered at them, and threw the microphone to the stage, causing feedback.

She then exited stage left, with Trixie.

Right into Sven Gallop.
