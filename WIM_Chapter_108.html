Part 1: Griffon and Received

TIME: 11:29 GKT
DATE: War Day 890/14 Noneus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Fort Grylan, Griffon Kingdom


Grylan was being established as a forward military base for NEIGHTO. I was recovering very well, given that most of my wounds were superficial. Besides two Engineers and one Griffon killed in the battle, we walked away relatively unscathed. One of those Engineers was Portia Crane, Long Crane's sister.

I'd been there.

I'd been powerless to stop it.

Like the others, I would remember her face, and her final cry would echo in my head the rest of my life.

I sat with Rapid, as he puffed his pipe and read over some architectural blueprints.

K: "That was.. quite a battle we had two days ago." I shrugged, as Ambrosia came up with Jim, looking very worried. "Brose?"

Ambrosia: "K-ah.. K? Can.. can I talk to you?" She looks.. afriad.. very unlike her. "Privately?"

K: "Sure, 'Brose." I got up, and followed her.

Ambrosia: "K? We're friends, right?" Her voice was very.. soft.. out of place.. WAY more feminine than usual.

We paced away from the group, over by a shelled-out house that had a new frame being installed.

K: "Yeah! We're good friends, -I- think. We've been together since the s-"

Ambrosia: "K, I'm pregnant!" She stopped, and froze in place, then reared up on her hind legs and hugged me.. crying.

K: "Ambrosia.." I.. started petting her mane. "I.." I didn't know what to say.

Ambrosia: "And, I'm scared.. I'm terrified.. I'm.. I don't.. want my foal in danger, K. No.. not.. not ever!" She sobbed quietly into my shoulder. "And.." She pulled back. "..send me home! Please? I-I mean, I know this is WAR and we have to do out PART, but.. K! If.. something happens to me and Jim, both?!" She sniffled. "W-whatever.. whatever pull or favors or anything that I have.. please.. send me home. I-I want out! Give me a desk job. In Ponyville. Or get me out completely." She lowered her head.

K: "Ambrosia.." I shook my head slowly. "I.." I shrugged, and flapped my arms. "I'll get you transferred to the Ponyville Militia. I'll see to it. You have my word." And I hugged into her. "You're one of my dearest friends, and you've been with me since the beginning. You've done so much for all of us. If anyone deserves to go home and raise her foals, it's you."

Ambrosia: "Th-thank you.." She nuzzled my face a bit, a very friendly gesture. "..if you need anything after the war.."

K: "I was already going to look you two up." I pet her mane a bit. "We're good friends. Anything." I nodded.

After talking with her for a bit, I walked back over to Rapid Bearing.

K: "I want you on the NEIGHTO Command Advisory Group." I nodded to him. "My Chief Engineer just resigned." I looked at Ambrosia and Jim, as she told Jim the news.

Rapid: "Hmpf." He nodded a bit. "If it'll get me back home to Aeriezona any faster, I'll do it." He raised his head. "Seriously. That battle was.. something. If everyone's going through stuff like that.." And lowered it. "..I can't be an Engineer if there's no one left to build for."

K: "Welcome to the team." I nodded to him. "Just remember, this is-"

Gorcat: "-the fightin'est outfit in the whole alliance." He paced over, and put a claw on my shoulder. "You take good care of my boss, y'hear?" He said, with reverence.

Rapid: "Sure." He smirked. "You got it."

Cosmic: "K." He paced over. "Rapid." He nodded to him. "Gorcat."

Gorcat: "Coz." A smirk.

Cosmic: "I wanted to compliment you on calling the artillery strike from the Enterprise's guns. That was something. Why didn't you go Artillery?" He gestured to the rough area the shells had landed.

Rapid: "Ohh.. you know.. I'm better and happier plotting charts and drawing up plans." He shrugged with one hoof. "I could do Arty, but.. it's instinct. Guesswork."

Cosmic: "Hm!" He nodded. "I'd like to compare our skills there, some time."

Rapid: "Well, yeah, I mean, chances are good enough one of us gets hurt.." He looked to me.

K: "He shattered his right foreleg, breaking a Porcine's skull." I smirked hard. "He was.. pretty damn amazing."

Gorcat: "Yeeaahh!" He grinned broadly. "Guy's a badass. Looks like a bookworm, but he pulls the fillies, too. You should see his WIFE!"

Cosmic: "A-Ah!" He grinned, full teeth. "I'm just doing my part!" And blushing a bit, too.

K: "Coz, I wouldn't be alive today without you." I nodded to him. "Without any of you."

Rapid: "Eh. Guess it's time to do my part, then." He nodded to where Olivine was talking with Blizz. "I want her help. She was Chemical Troops, right?"

K: "Yeah." I nodded. "Engineer trained."

Rapid: "Yep. I want her as my direct battle buddy. Something happens, she'll be able to understand whatever the Tartarus I might've written down." He pointed to her.

K: "I'll see to it." I shrugged.

Cosmic: "SO! What's next, K?" He looked around at all the Engineers working on the facility.

K: "We finish sweeping the countryside for more Spec Ops teams. Then we move our assets in and help the Griffons get set up. But, we can leave that to our other forces. OUR next move is getting ready for the Rainbow of Light." I tapped the rock I was sitting on. "I want our expedition prepped and ready to head out as reinforcements get here. Three days. You and Rapid get everything together." I looked at him. "What's the coldest you've ever been?"

Rapid: "Mmm.. cold night on a mountain, once. Needed a couple blankets." He shrugged.

K: "..make sure he gets an extra sweater." I lowered my head a bit.

Rapid: "Well, gosh darn it, it can't be THAT cold!" He chuckled.

K: "Dude.. we're talking cold so cold your spit freezes before it hits the ground. I've been IN it before. And I LIKE it." I grinned.

Cosmic: "Eh, I've had a few cold times. Baltimare used to get some hellacious winters back when I was a foal." He shrugged. "Ice fishing for crabs is a bit silly, but, it happens and it can be done."

Rapid: "..I surrender!" He chortled. "Extra matches and a few extra flints, then." And grinned.

K: "Alright, you guys start gathering the things we need. And check with Olivine if we can get some more hoof warmers." I wagged a finger and got up to leave. "Gorcat?" I motioned for him to join me.

Gorcat: "..let me guess? This is goodbye?" He said, softly.

K: "..yeah." I nodded. "My final act as your General is to promote you to the rank of Senior Colonel."

I handed him the small case with a single eight-point star in it. A bit numbly, I opened it, and pinned the star to his collar, and pat the front of his shoulders.

He hugged me.

Gorcat: "I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you." He said, pulling back. "You are my Nest Brother. For life. And every one of my descendants will know this." He gripped my shoulders. "I know you don't want to be a Messiah or something - I don't.. didn't.. either. But, damnit, boss.." He turned his head a bit. "I hope you get to survive the war. I want to take you hunting. Our way. And go camping in the hills. And.." He shook his head, smiling. "..just be bros."

K: "Even if we can't.." I grabbed his shoulders. "..we had one hell of a time together."

Gilda: "HEY, YOU LUNKHEADS!" She skidded to a stop almost next to us. "What the Tartarus is this?! A funeral!?" She grabbed us both in a hug.

Gorcat: "GILDA!" He laughed, and hugged back. "I thought you'd be sidelined longer!"

Gilda: "Yeah." She smirked. "Well Wishes is pissed. But, hey, the staples are out, the wound is closed, I'm lifting weights, and the chicks are in good hooves." She shrugged.

K: "Meet your new king." I smirked.

Gilda: "NO FREAKIN' WAY?!" She slapped his shoulders. "YOU!?"

Gorcat: "Heh.. yeaahh.." He tilted his head to the side. "I.. restored the idol." And shrugged. "Married a lass named Greta."

K: "Greta Grainsberry." I nodded.

Gilda: "OH! Ohh.. yeah, I knew her bro." She nodded a bit. "You tell her about us, Tiger?" She smirked.

Gorcat: "She knows." He grinned, and pointed behind Gilda.

Greta: "AAAAAAhhhh! My competition arrives!" She sautered up (and I noted that Greta was actually a bit smaller than Gilda), and gave a few back-leg kicks to the grass.

Gilda, returning in kind, playfully lowered her front end to the ground, and the two casually lept forwards like cats, then coming to a hug.

K: "..that.. ah? Common?" I shrugged.

Gorcat: "They're basically saying that they're as close as sister-in-laws or.. co-mates.. or something. Very familair greeting." He nodded. "They accept each other."

K: "Good." I nodded. "Considering her kids are technically Dukes and Duchesses as they came from your seed, according to Griffonic royal patronage traditions." I smirked. "They'll be behind Greta's eggs, but, still. They're family." I looked over to where Dash was, who JUST noticed her wife had arrived, and buzzed the deck to come over and hug and.. casually make out with her. "We all are."

Gorcat: "To the end." He nodded.

And we were. Friendship is Magic, but family can be even more so. Now, we had a mountain to climb.

Part 2: Scale

TIME: 09:17 GKT
DATE: War Day 895/19 Noneus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Trillyhigh Mountain Range, Northern Griffon Kingdom


"When I get high, I get high on speed
Top fuel funny car's a drug for me
My heart, my heart
Kickstart my heart
Always got the cops coming after me
Custom built bike doing 103
My heart, my heart
Kickstart my heart..!"
(Exerpt from "Kickstart My Heart" by Motley Crue, written by Nikki Sixx, (c) 1989 Elektra Records)


Giving Dex Runner the remaining music on my cell phone and laptop was a mistake. He was blasting a remix of "Kickstart My Heart" by Motley Crue over Comms as the five Zeds and two XY's jetted at 56 knots (103kp/h, 64mp/h) over the icy tundra plain leading up to the ascent.

We decided to approach the Fortress from the Griffon Kingdom side. It would make the climb easier.

Not that I minded the music. It was a morale booster. Fluttershy, especially, was nodding her head to it. I moved over, and helped her stand, so she could headbang properly, holding her under her wings as she leaned into the hand rail. She went from simple head nodding, to head banging, to hair swirling in seconds.

She was into this kind of music? Huh! I guess it just wasn't regularly available here.

Teddy was head banging like a pro, and his hoof was vaguely folded into Devil Horns. Reminding, of course, that ponies of his stage of evolution had more flexible hooves that behaved like hands.

K: "Whoa! Yeah! Kickstart my heart, give it a start!"

Teddy: "Wooooooooooooooohooooooooooooo!!" He clomped his hoof on the hand rail. "SHAKE IT, baby!"

K: "Alright, already. Blizz! Time to Target?"

Blizz: "Three minutes! Everyone get ready!"

K: "FINAL WEAPONS CHECK!" I checked and pulled the bolt gently on my Grant.

We'd winterized the rifles. The temperatures outside were already hovering around -2C/28F. It would get colder. Everyone was in Arctic Gear already, and as most of it was commercial, we didn't bother trying to get camouflage for it. Rarity did hastily make a few coveralls of white fabric with some random splotches on it, but by and large, we weren't going to bother.

We came over the last rise, and the aeroskiffs started slowing down. We had two Gunboats with us, the others acting as transports. We would set up a base camp as close to the ascent as possible, and defend it. In case something happened, I -needed- a place to escape -to- that I could hold.

As we came in for a hover, I stepped up and scanned with my binoculars. As expected, the Tillyhighs were 'lumpy' and had shallow grades going up most of the way. There was a perfect spot for a base camp, on a plateau, near an easy looking slope.

K: C> "Alpha Actual to Snowball Flight. Plateau, bearing zero one five. Take them in slow." I directed.

LTjg Opaline: C> "Snowball One, roger."

ENS Ruby Highpolish: C> "Snowball Two, roger."

LTjg Emeraldine Alight: C> "Snowball Three, roger."

ENS North Starcurtain: C> "Snowball Four, roger that!"

ENS Lighten Sapphire: C> "Snowball FIVE! We roger!"

Cosmic: C> "Alpha Group Two, I gotcha, K!"

Crystal Kingdom's Aerotransport Flotilla built around the Zeds, now. They had enough in service to form exactly one (and they just lost most of 1-2 Air Transport Divison). We had the 1-1 Air Transport Division under Opaline, and 1-3 Air Escort Division under Emeraldine, plus XY-3105 on loan from the Command Division.

Each Flotilla consisted of 24 Zeds and one XY for now. In the future, a direct replacement for the XY's, a command-and-control craft currently called the XA's or Alphas, would replace the XY's.

The Crystal Kingdom wanted the 2nd Mobile Fleet to consist of 2 Transport Flotillas, and 1 Frigate Division. A new Frigate design was in the works that would allow Superb and Swiftsure to more or less retire to Homeland Protection duties. Sort of like a Coastal Defense Craft.

We set down on the plateau, the Zeds and XY's hovering a bit off the ground. Glida hefted me and the two of us, soon followed by Webley, Dash, and Fluttershy, went down to have a look.

Gilda: "How's the ground feel?" She asked, flexing her gloves.

K: "Solid. Solid enough, anyway." I motioned for the aeroskiffs to go ahead and land.

Webley: "This'll be a good spot for a base camp." She nodded. "Who're you taking on the ascent?"

K: "The girls, the lads, Cody, Gilda, Dex, and Blizz, with half of Havoc's Rangers, and Seven's foxes." I nodded. "Rest of you, get this place set up. If we have to run, I want to have a good, safe place to run TO."

Dash: "Mmm, this'll be awesome!" She fluttered down. "It's going to get a lot colder, though.." She tucked her wings in her Pegasi Parka. "..flying'll be risky."

Gilda: "No kidding." She shrugged. "Though I'm pretty sure K is aware we can get frostbitten wings, babe."

Fluttershy: "Mmm.. I always feel so bad for the little creatures that can't sleep all winter." She frowned a bit. "I just want to take them all into my cabin and cuddle them until spring!"

Dash: "Yeah." She gave her a half hug. "That's our Fluttershy."

I made my way across the Plateau, as the Aeroskiffs set down and everyone disembarked. Fizzlepop (Fizzy) was now in a Crystal Kingdom uniform with her own cold weather gear over it. No rank, no division, just a Utility Uniform (which was much like the US 1960's Olive Drab Utility Uniform, except closer to grey-green). She asked Sombra, personally, if she could join up, and she'd get training once we got back.

She was making connections, too. Friendships. And like many of my troops, was learning on the job. Right now, she was helping get cargo off of one of the Skiffs.

K: "Getting into the swing of things?" I asked, grabbing the other end of a crate, to give her a hand (literally).

Fizzy: "Yeah." She smiled a bit. "Thank you. Again." And beamed. "Now, I want to survive. And help. I.." She trailed off. "..I have reasons to care, now."

K: "I'm glad." I nodded.

We spent the next hour getting things off of the Zeds and the XY's, and then sent them back for the rest of the cargo. The tools of the war were evolving. If we'd tried this at the start of the war, it would have taken us almost a month to even march this far, and a huge army to sustain the operation. Or, if we'd gone in with only the core team, we would have had to measure our rations very carefully, or try to scout out the path to see if we could get food resupply.

Fizzy: "I'm making more friends." She shrugged. "Emeraldine wants me in her Division." She grinned. "Can't wait!"

K: "You'll do fine." I nodded.

Three hours later, the flight showed back up with the cargo, and we set about unloading it. We wouldn't attempt an ascent until tomorrow. Part of me was very excited and quite nervous. If the Rainbow of Light was up there, and we could get it, we would be able to take on Tirek, no problem.

We dug in once we had all the cargo ready. Frozen ground is no match for explosive trench diggers. Three sets of them are set off per trench. We soon had a rough heptagon shape, with a triangle redoubt in the center. The center area was one big tent with stones for a foundation. Rapid and Olivine even managed to make a chimney and fireplace in the center.

K: "Now THIS is a nice little base." I nodded. "After we leave, see about setting up some pillboxes at the corners." I nodded. "Havoc's team should be here any minute."

Yeah, due to the loss of the Zeds earlier, I elected to have us go in first, then the cargo, then Havoc's Rangers. One good thing, was, now that we had a place to break the supply crates down in, we could burn the wood from them. More wood and coal was coming in with Havoc's team, and regular supply runs would be made.

Havoc: C> "Hunter Actual! Coming in!"

K: "And there he is." I nodded.

I went outside and watched his team disembark. I nodded to all of them. They were fully geared up, even wearing pawboots - they usually didn't. Seven's select team was with them as well.

K: "Seven. Havoc." I nodded to them. "Seven, your team needs a permanent NEIGHTO Radio Code. I'm assigning you the code name Ares."

Seven Devils: "Sounds good." He smirked.

K: "According to NEIGHTO Radio Code, you're Ares Actual, your second should be Ares One, then down the line of seniority." I nodded to the others.

Seven Devils: "Alright." He nodded to his team. "Everyone, these are my Foxes. Villa Blackglove, Whisp Foxfire, Firetail Whitesox, Clover Jumper, and Andreia Fieldhopper." And a look to me. "All Sergeants."

Villa was the largest, and I made him out to be the Fox equivalent of an Earth Pony. He was stout, no two ways about it. He was armed with the Vulpesylvanian choice in Machine Gun, the Dionysus. He had 'Canadian Fox' marble fur.

Whisp was a white 'Arctic Fox' and a Pegasus.. fox? She had wings, and black "gloves-and-socks" fur on her forelegs and back legs up to the first joints. She was clearly the team's scout, with a cut down cargo load, and the carbine version of the Athena assault rifle, the Pallas.

Firetail was a standard orange fox, with a white tail tuft, and a Unicorn like Seven. He was also their Sniper, armed with an Artemis Sniper Rifle. His arctic uniform had some extra bits hanging off of it, making a sort of half ghillie suit sort of thing.

Clover Jumper was a nonstandard fox that fit this world - she was green furred, with dark gloves-and-socks. She carried the team's radio and was an "earth fox" like Villa, though not as stout. She also had the team's medical gear.

Andriea was another flying fox, slate grey, with small 'gloves' that came over only her paws and not past the wrist. She had an Athena, but carried multiple Rifle Grenades, and some extra explosives. The team's sapper and anti-armor trooper.

K: "Well rounded six-person team." I nodded to each of them. "They have any shooting experience?"

Villa: "General." He nodded, pacing forward a bit. "I've taken a life. I was part of the National Police Emergency Action Team. As I was told you know, we've had issues with infiltrators and things. There was an operation several months before our ambassador met up with you, where several terrorists were killed. They were Zebras, all of them, but they were from Orghuz, we now know. Seventeen suspects, and I killed three. Two with my service rifle, one with my bare paws."

K: "I see." I nodded, and looked to Havoc, like, is this guy legit?

Havoc: "Hmm." He gave him a nod and short sniff. "Brutal, was it?"

Villa: "Mmh." He lowered his head a bit, and raised it fully, so we could see the small scar that followed his jaw line. "Very."

K: "Alright." I nodded. "Havoc, from your team, I want you, Bella, O'Fang, Panters, Wuffberry, Chompers, Fuzzin, Lady Olivedale, and Jason the Tramp." I gestured at the base. "Rest stay here as a rescue team, under Barker."

Havoc: "Works!" He grinned and nuzzed Seven. "Seems we get to play again, buddy."

Seven: "We do!" He beamed a grin. "When do we set out?"

K: "Tomorrow." I nodded firmly. "I want as many daylight hours as possible, and I want us rested."

Havoc: "Got it." He nodded back, looking to Seven. "Command is pretty loose around here - if Forest Spirit or Sacquet are here, they're usually K's seconds. Other than that, we just work together."

Seven: "Understood." He nodded firmly. "Come on, team, let's get squared away."

Tomorrow the climb would begin..

..I had no idea what I was actually getting into.

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Trillyhigh Climb

TIME: 07:22 GKT
DATE: War Day 896/19 Noneus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Trillyhigh Mountain Range, Northern Griffon Kingdom


Breakfast was a simple ordeal. Steel cut oats, some bacon and ham for the foxes and wolves (and me), and canned bread rolls. Tea and coffee. Some hay for the ponies. We were already out, now, approaching the foothills.

K: "Alright, this first section should be easy enough to climb. We're already 1100 meters above sea level. These foothills go up another 600 meters or so. Or, in another way, we'll be a full Country Mile above sea level soon. Go slow, let yourself acclimate." I said, as we started the casual walk up.

Blizz: "He's right. Also expect temperatures to plunge as we go up. Probably three degrees per hundred meters." She nodded. "Keep yourself covered, and your wings well tucked."

Cosmic: "Man.. I haven't been mountain climbing since I was in Docksylvania as a foal." He grinned.

Gaze: "Oi? Really, now?" He grinned as well, right behind him.

Norfy: "Figures. Despite my more liberal raising, I've never been on a mountain." He shrugged. "I've been colder than this, though. Feels nice."

Havoc: "This is nothing." He beamed a grin.

O'Fang: "Tell me aboot it!" He snickered. "I been in winters a LOT worse're than this'in."

Cosmic: "Oh, yeah. The climb is nice, though.. when we break out the ropes and tackle, THEN we're going to have a time of it." He shrugged.

Gilda: "Yeah. Flying'll be very hard. I mean, if someone falls, Dash or I could catch them easy." She looked over at Whisp. "Think you could catch a pony?"

Whisp Foxfire: "Probably." She nodded. "Probably not the General, though - too heavy." And shrugged. "Might be able to break his fall, though."

Sunset: "Man.. why'd this thing have to be up here?!" She snorted. "So freaking cold."

Fluttershy: "It is pretty cold." She moved up near Sunset. "We'll be okay."

Applejack: "Y'all'll be alright, Sunset." She grinned.

Sunset: "I hope so! Finding those portals was a total bust." She frowned.

K: "I'm starting to think they were sealed already." I shrugged. "The Orghuzians deposited their forces, and closed the door behind them - they either won and got to come back, or lost, and died."

Sunset: "A one-way mission, huh?" She snorted again. "Sounds like them. Why is it Evil never cares about the little pony?!"

Toola: "Because the nature of evil requires them to commit carnage for a proper goal." She shrugged. "Lots of ponybeings and others will die to get there - their very nature demands they be sacrificed on the altar of their vision for the future."

Sunset: "I suppose you're right." She sighed.

The climb was full of chatter. I didn't mind - there was no evidence of enemy activity, no need to keep quiet all the time. The foxes seemed particularly keen to chatter with the ponies.


TIME: 09:16 GKT


Cosmic: "Hey, K.." He nodded to the side, as he was a bit ahead of me. "I see something."

K: "What'cha got, Coz?" I moved up to him, and took a knee.

Cosmic: "There, in that little snow drift. I.. it looks.. like a piece of scarf?" He looked perplexed. "Havoc, on me."

Cosmic taking command.. talk about coming a long way since the bookworm with the artillery charts.

Havoc: "Gotcher back, bud." He advanced with him as they checked the snow drift.

They pulled out a raggedy, very interestingly patterned snow scarf. It reminded me of tribal Eastern Europe, somewhat, or even Scandinavia. Noo... more Eastern European or even Caucasian.

K: "Someone lives up here." I concluded.

Cosmic: "The patterns.. hm." He shook his head. "Rarity, can you confirm this is wool?"

Rarity: "Indeed, darling." She paced over and levitated the scarf. "Wool, yes, processed and dried. Primitively, but well enough. Construction is VERY solid!" She looked to me. "Whoemver made this, knew what they were doing." She shrugged. "The damage to it is time's inevitable march. It's probably been out here for a year or so."

K: "Stash that away." I nodded to Cosmic.

Cosmic: "Gotcha." He got it in his saddle bag.

Havoc: "I didn't think there was anyone here." He wrinkled his nose. "I mean, I could vaguely smell PONY on that scarf."

K: "Really?!" I blinked. "Alright, everyone watch your sectors. Let's go."

With that, we were off again.


TIME: 11:44 GKT


K: "Alright, this flat area's a good spot to stop." I held up my fist. "Everyone, chill. Break out lunch." I nodded. "Plenty of snow, see if you can find some burnables and cook." I got my pack off, and stretched.

Cosmic: "Hm.. K?" He paced over to the flat rock we'd basically stopped at. "Dr. Allcome? This look like it's been used, to you?"

Dr. Allcome: "Why.. yes." He paced over and examined it. "K, he's right, there's signs of fires having been burnt here before. Not often, but often enough." He ran his hoof over the center. "Signs of heat cracking, for sure. Bonfires, probably. With all this wind, though.." He shook his head.

K: "Good eye, Coz." I nodded and patted his shoulder.

Cosmic: "Eh. I've been learning a lot." He nodded. "I think after the war's over, I want to start teaching."

K: "Oh? What subject?" I asked, as I helped get some rocks over to build a circle.

Cosmic: "Land Warfare." He nodded. "We may never fight another enemy like Tirek again, but.." He shrugged. "..I don't want to leave Eqeustria without the lessons we learned, just in case we do."

K: "You know what? That's very selfless of you, Coz." I nodded. "I feel the same - you know that. I don't want you all to have to go through this again, but if it ever happens, I don't know if I'll be there for it."

The crew brought over some wood and things - most of it already dried..

Clover Jumper: "General." She nodded to me. "We found plenty of wood. And.. here's the thing, sir." She set her pile down. "Most of it was somewhat stacked in a small hollow about 120 meters from here." She pointed. "A loose stack, yes, but it was covered with branches. Like, it was stored there. Sir."

K: "Just K, Clover." I nodded to her. "Alright. Clear sings someone lives up here. Everyone stay alert, but let's get lunch cooked and ourselves warmed up."

We did just that. It was even colder, now, and our instruments were registering it as -4C/25F or so. The fire went a long way to warming us all up.

After a bit.. I felt like I was being watched. At about the same instant, Havoc's team and Seven's team all stopped eating and shot their looks to the north-north-west, where the wind was coming from.

K: "Someone's here and watching us." I said simply in a lower tone.

Havoc: "What'cha want us to do?" He shrugged a bit and returned to his food (as did they all).

K: "Whisp, Lady Olivedale, and Gilda. One at a time, break off from the circle like you're going to do your business or get more wood or something. Circle around. Get eyes on. Come back. Do not make contact." I nodded to them.

Gilda: "Right." She nodded, as did the rest.

Gilda moved off first, as though she needed to stretch her wings. She hopped off the cliff back in the direction we'd come, looking like she was going for a quick flight.

Lady Olivedale, on the other hand, got up a few moments later, and trotted to the bushes, giving a couple dainty looks around before ducking in them.

Whisp.. I didn't even SEE her move. Just, one second she was there, next she wasn't.

I waited.


TIME: 12:19 GKT


I heard a rifle shot.

K: "Damnit, I said no engagement!" I stood, and-

There were a lot more. On full automatic.

K: C> "GILDA! REPORT!" I called into my headset as all of us got up and charge in the direction of the shooting.

Gilda: C> "K! HELP!"

She.. she does not say 'help.'

We sprinted.

K: "FAN OUT! FAN OUT! BY SQUAD!" I ordered. "LADS, ON ME! AJ, GET THE GIRLS TO THE FAR LEFT FLANK! HAVOC, SEVEN, RIGHT!"

We ran towards the noise, cresting another rise in the terrain to see a bowl in the ground below us. Whisp, Lady, and Gilda were pulling a pair of Fillies back from..

Sunset: "K! THAT'S A WINDIGO!" She shouted. "GIRLS.. GET.. GET THE JEWELRY ON!"

Rarity: "Our first time with you.." She trailed off, putting hers on. "..you can do this, Sunset."

I saw Sunset smile a bit.

Cosmic: "We'll hold here. Guns are useless on those things." He nodded.

K: "Come on!"

Sunset: "YEAH! COME ON!" She charged down there - they all did.

K: "GILDA! OVER HERE!" I shouted at the top of my lungs.

Gilda: "GOTCHA!" She shouted back, and snatched the two Fillies in her arms, freed her wings from her Parka, and took flight. Wisp followed her, and Lady Olivedale turned and broke into a flat run, her canine form pitching up and down like a machine.

Sunset: "GET READY!" She called, taking her position at the head of the formation of Six.

I stepped in front as well.

K: "Ready." I nodded.

Sunset: "Love Power, K!" She ordered.

K: "Gotcha!" I steeled myself, ready for Magic Time.

The Windigo's wispy form charged down towards us, like a darkening thunder cloud. Malice in its visage. Murder in its heart.

Sunset: "NOW!" She glowed with magical energy, and their powers united, sending forth a beam..

K: "CADENCE, GIVE ME STRENGTH!" I shouted, holding the sword, pointing it at the Windigo.

I felt the Magic Beam hit me, made a mystical conduit through me, and went down the blade of the sword, fused with Cadence's Love Power.. and fire one gigantic beam of pink-red-orange power the diameter and thickness of a 55-gallon oil drum.

It hit the Windigo in the face, enveloped it, and CRUSHED it like it was made of DUST. We could hear its cry on the wind as it dissepated.

Problem is.. four more took its place, rising from a cave. They were just as big as the first one, and looked REALLY MAD at us. Gee, wonder why?

I redirected the beam's power over them each in turn, as fast as I could, focusing my own power as hard as I could manage. I didn't have magic, I had willpower, and.. it was starting.. my vision was starting to darken.. I couldn't hold on much more. I couldn't even talk, just yell in a primal scream.

Fortunately, Gaze got the right idea, and directed Andriea to start firing Rifle Grenades at the cave opening. Three shots, and the cave collapsed. They were cut off, and they likewise were destroyed.

I fell flat on my face.. and just barely rolled over.

Sunset: "Ohhhh....!" *GROAN!* "Ohh.. WE DID IT, GIRLS!" She laughed.

Applejack: "Sho'nuff! HEY!" She laughed as well.

Toola: "I KNEW we could!" She cheered.

Rarity: "YES, Darlings!" She laid back and clapped her hooves.

Rainbow Dash: "Man, that took a lot outta me!" She puffed, a bit out of breath.

Fluttershy: "Mmm.. I'm okay. I'm just glad we got here in time!" She coo'd a bit.

K: "Well. Point proven. Sunset really IS the Element of Magic, now!" I smiled as the girls came over, and I hugged them all, sitting up. "GILDA! Report!" I called out to her.

She approached with the two Fillies. One was almost purely snow white, the other was dark chestnutty with a very poofy mane, that looked more like wool than hair.

Gilda: "We got here just in time." She shook her head. "There was a Mare, here, too." She raised her head, looking around.

A very dark chestnut mare, clothed in various wrappings and scarves, came out from the woods with a large torch in her mouth, lit. She saw us, saw the Windigo was gone, and dropped it.

K: "Must've been going to get something to chase it off with." I shrugged, getting up. "Greetings. I'm-"

Mare: "H-H-H-Human..!" She looked absolutely terrified.

K: "..my name is K." I softened my tone, and lowered my head a bit.

Fluttershy: "Ah.. hello." She smiled. "We rescued your friends." She nudged the fillies.

Filly #1: "Awe, come on! Don't be scared, Crackling! They SAVED us! They gots tha' Legendary Elements!" She beamed a grin.

Mare: "No, no, noo.. this.. this cannot be!" She shook her head, reeling back, hooves up defensively.

She was paniciking. I could see it.

K: "Fillies, please go with her. Don't worry about us. Your friend is very, very scared, and I want to show her we mean no harm." I spoke in very low, comforting tones as I gently pushed them towards the one named Crackling.

Filly #2: "Aw, okay, mistah!" She nuzzled my hand a sec, and the two of them moved towards the older mare.

Once they were in range, she reached out, and grabbed both of them by their clothes, pulled them in close, and then pushed them ahead of her, as she retreated as fast as she could manage.

Something about me.. scared her. More than the Windigo. She was willing to throw hooves with that thing, but not even TALK to me. Not even at a distance.

I sat and crossed my legs.

K: "That accent was Swedish. Same as Marta and Sven." I nodded firmly.

Gilda: "I noticed." She blinked. "Aunt Marta is so nice.. you know she visited while you were away and I was pregnant? Her and Sven."

K: "Really? No one told me." I shrugged, and stood up. "He fare well after his battle?"

Gilda: "Eh, broke his leg, but he healed up good. Frimm and Kozac didn't make it, but neither did Ritt." She spat on the ground. "I'm.. me and Dash are to call her Aunt and Uncle." She smiled a bit.

K: "That's awesome." I shrugged. "Back to the camp site. We finish eating, then we'll try and track her." I nodded in the direction she retreated from. "Try. Guaranteed, once she got some distance, she hid her tracks." I shrugged.

Wisp: "I can track her, sir." She nodded.

Lady Olivedale: "Easily." She nodded, and smirked at Wisp.

K: "Yeah." I shrugged.

So, we went back to the fire, and sat down to finish lunch. I was thinking about her, and why she might be so afraid, given what I knew about the legends of this world. And what I'd been told - that I'd gain the Power of Flight from the highest peak in Griffondom.

Well, we were at the very edge of Griffondom as it was.. maybe..

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Chill Valley

TIME: 12:47 GKT
DATE: War Day 886/19 Noneus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Trillyhigh Mountain Range, North of the Griffon Kingdom


We were done with lunch, and we were on the trail of the Mare named Crackling. As I expected, after about a fifty or so meter sprint, she'd taken a branch and covered her tracks in the snow. She also made an effort to hide her scent with little bushels of potpurri.

Wisp: "..amatuer level stuff. I mean, it's a good effort, General, but she clearly's never been stalked by wolves or foxes." She shrugged.

Lady Olivedale: "No kidding. That and one of the fillies peed over here." She tittered a little. "Poor thing. I think she was scared!"

Havoc: "It's pretty clear they're hunted by SOMEthing.. I wonder what?" He shrugged.

O'Fang: "Mmm.. hazard'a guess, Capt'n.." He motioned for us to come over where he was.

There was clear territorial markings in several trees around here. Gouges torn out by predator's claws. Several competing ones, at that. These were the marks of an Apex Predator.

O'Fang: "Whoever left 'dese." He shrugged a bit.

Dr. Allcome: "Goodness!" He took out a little measuring stick. "Whatever left these? The claws have to be at least a hundred and fifty millimeters (6 inches) long, and VERY sharp."

Fluttershy: "Hmm." She sniffed them. "They don't hunt by smell, whatever they are. I mean.. they.. probably do to an extent, but judging by what that Mare did to throw us off, and the fact that these predators mark like this instead of by scent?" She shrugged a bit. "They.. uhm.. probably hunt primarily by sight."

K: "Very good." I nodded to them all. "The snow is pretty fresh around here, so, no chance we can see these things' tracks just yet, but keep your eyes.." I looked over at Toola, who had a vegetable peeler in her mouth. "..OPEN! Hah!" I pointed to her.

Toola: "You spoiled the joke!" She stuck it away, and stuck her tongue out at me.

Applejack: "Y'all stick that werm out ag'n, I'll find me a berd t'eat it." She.. she wiggled her eyebrows at her.

Dash: "..she'll do it, too." She coughed a bit.. and blushed.

Which made Gilda blush.

Which made ME blush.

Gaze: "OI! Hahahaha!" He laughed, and made a goofy grin.

Cosmic: "..mhm, and WHO was it that liked bits-and-bridles and schoolfilly outfits?" He ribbed Gaze.

Gaze: "OI!" He turned ELECTRIC red.. "T-T-That's persn'al!"

Sunset: "HAHAH! And his Mare isn't even here to thump you!" She grinned.

Cosmic: "Precisely why I did it." He grinned mischeviosuly.

Norfy: "Cosmic.. I didn't know you had it in you." He gave him a very Bro-Nod.

Cosmic: "Eh." He shrugged. "After everything we've been through?" A nod to Norfy. "I'm not as snowed in as I used to be."

Norfy.. froze. And blinked a bit.

K: "Bleed Through." I slid over to him. "Talk to me."

Norfy: "..they stayed behind, despite the cold.." He blinked rapidly.. then shook his head. "I'm.. sorry, K. I just got a faint glimpse." He looked at me. "I think.. I know.. them? It's hard to describe, but I feel familiar, now." He nodded a bit. "Doesn't mean much other than I'd feel at-ease around them. I'm sure they won't, around me."

K: "It's something." I shrugged. "Alright, back on the trail." I nodded.

We followed her scent.. down into a valley that had warmer temperatures. We descended, easily, another 700 meters in just a few minutes. The valley.. was fairly warm. Easily in the 10-12C (50-55F) range. Enough that people were opening their parkas.

K: "Pretty warm down here." I nodded. "This valley might be in warm spot. It probably has something resembling a growing season." I looked around through my binoculars.. and spotted.. "..farm, 600 meters east-north-east." I pointed.

Sunset: "Huh! And no one's supposed to be living around here..?" She frowned.

Rarity: "It seems to be a whole civilization, darling.." She was tapping her hooves. "..and their fashion! OH! If I copied some of it, I could make an absolute KILLING after the war!" She beamed a grin.

Dash: "Or during it. No saying you can't make some stuff up next time we have some Leave." She shugged her wings (which were out of her parka). "I mean, seeing what they wear? Heck, I'll even model for you! It looks pretty awesome!"

Gilda: "Mmm.." She tilted her head. "..my wife in tribal fashions..? It'll be more fun getting you out of them." She wiggled her brow a bit.

Norfy: "Logically speaking, sir, if they have a farm down here, they probably have a very diverse diet." He was scanning with binoculars, too. "River, north-east, 800 meters or so. Looks pretty big. I bet our target crossed it."

K: "I bet she did, and warned whomever's at that farm that I'm in the area." I shrugged. "Let's hope they don't have firearms of some kind. I mean, they could've developed flintlocks or something."

Seven: "I'll take my team, scout out the first 500 meters to the edge of the growing fields and stop there, just in case they laid any traps." He nodded.

K: "Go for it. If you see anyone, make no contact, and get back to us." I pointed.

They.. basically vanished.

Havoc: "I'm starting to see the difference between us." He nodded. "We're more like YOUR Rangers. They're more like.. ghosts."

K: "Or, rather, they're the difference between Human US Army Rangers and US Army 'Green Berets' - that is, a Green Beret will infiltrate an area with no sign of their approach, silently do one or two things, then get out. Rangers CAN do that, but they're more suited to sustained combat if needed." I shrugged. "Come on."

We advanced into the valley, not knowing who was here, or what, exactly, sort of civilization there was. Whatever the situation, we needed to get in contact with these Ponies, if for no other reason than to make sure they were protected against The Storm King and Tirek.

A fascinating and hardy peoples. We could see signs of how well developed they truly were, the closer we got. Once we hit the outer edge of the farm, there were wooden fences.. adorned with carved bones like talismans against evil. There were road signs. The grass ended, and turned into a well maintained corduroy road.

The signs, oddly, were not in a langauge anyone recognized. Not even me. The shape of the lines and the angles reminded me of ancient, pre-Christian Scandinavian or perhaps Slavic. Some of the symbols on the bones reminded me of them, too.

We were met by Seven and his team 250 meters from the edge of the farm proper. He was in the open, as were they all, and sitting right by a wooden wall, about shoulder height, that separated the main farm from the outer farm property, that I presumed were some kind of grazing field.

Seven: "Sir." He pointed.. to the Wards hanging off the wall - carved masks made of wood, I presumed, or perhaps shaped clay.

They were painted, too, and each had a little symbol etched underneath.

A Wendigo, for sure.. some kind of demon.. then..

..a Raptorian..

..a Porcine..

...and a human.
