Part 1: Nuclear Heist

TIME: 08:56 IT
DATE: War Day 814/28 Sextus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Near the Royal Palace, Pamplona, Navarre

I was prepped, Webley was prepped, I rose to a combat crouch, and tapped Amethyst on the shoulder.

"Blinking" was a new experience for me. I felt like my vision zoomed from what I was looking at - the Crate in the distance - to being almost right next to it, as though my FOV got zoomed to it on a scroll wheel mouse.

When I realized the FOV motion had stopped, I was right behind one of the Herdiet guards. I bashed him over the head with the HK91's stock, straight down, on the back of his neck, whipped the rifle up into my arms, just as Webley and Amethyst opened fire on the other guards, pivoted on my heel to catch the guard behind me, and fired two shots into his torso, folding him in half.

I moved behind the crate immediately, and took position, as Sunset at the other ponies opened fire. The courtyard was a hail storm of bullets in short order. I sighted in on targets using the Hensoldt, but its magnification was too high for these ranges, so I resorted to instinct aiming. I went through all 20 rounds in short order, though each shot was just about a kill or an incapacitation - 168gr/10.8g bullets at 807m/s will DO that to Pony and Goat. I ducked down and reloaded quickly, as the manual of arms was close to the Bradley, it was muscle memory at this point.

I raised back up, and saw that most of the Herdiets were trying to engage the paratroopers across the street, and were kinda ignoring us. I looked at the awning where the senior officers had been, and saw that seven of the ten were dead almost in place or just slightly away from it. I picked out where one of them ran, behind a decorative planter. He was firing at US with his pistol. I sighted in on him, he at the perfect range for 4x magnification, and put a round between his eyes. He flopped dead. Another officer tried to make a run for the far side of the courtyard, but he got cut down by an MG team.

They were down to ONE senior officer... the command was crippled...

Time to gamble.

K: "CEASE FIRE! CEASE FIRE!" I screamed at the top of my lungs, and pulled Webley and Amethyst especially close to the crate.

Everyone stopped shooting.. the Herdiets lacking officers, were just trying to get to good cover - the courtyard offered very little.

K: "WHOEVER'S LEFT OVER THERE! PARLAY! PARLAY! YOU SAVVY!?" I screamed towards the troops left on the steps of the Cathedral.

Maj. Asimov: "DIS IS MAJOR ASMIMOV! WHITE FLEG, GENERAL K!" He pulled out a handkerchief, and waved it.

K: "You two stay under cover. If this goes sideways, Ame, you NEED to get me out, or I'm dead." I patted her flank.

Amethyst: "I get'cher back, K." She spoke as a friend - I suppose she was.

I paced out, setting my rifle down next to the crate, and pulling out a small white sheet. I knew Sunset would have the major in her sights the second he came out. We met halfway between the bomb and the Cathedral.

K: "Major Asimov, I am indeed General K." I nodded to him.

Maj. Asimov: "Major Piyotr Asimov, Command Advizory Group Navarre." He nodded back. "Vhat are your terms." He was a very 'stout' (verging on portly) officer that clearly grew up doing heavy labor, and sported a very impressive and thick mustache, brown like his mane, though his coat was mostly white.

K: "Unconditional surrender." I nodded back. "You'll be executed if you return to the Herdiet Union without the bomb, and the bomb is my goal - I can't let you have it under any circumstances. Surrender to me, unconditionally, and request asylum - I'll grant it for you and your troops. All of them get to live long and happy lives.." I looked to the side where my Paratroopers were. "..the alternative is extermination." I gave a soft side-nod. "I out-number your forces, and it's clear that if the shooting started again, they'd all be cut down in about five minutes. Then, I sweep and clear the palace, and the defenders in there die in horrific pain and fear. Those are my elite - my Spetsnaz - over there. They don't generally take prisoners." I looked back at him.

Maj. Asimov: "As you have eleemeenated all de other officers, it falls to me to be responsible for de troops dat remain." He nodded slowly. "Moreover, I haven't the means to deny you the ultimate goal, thus.. our deaths would be assured, you are right." He sighed. "I offer de surrender of my command, General." He pulled out his pistol with his off hoof, and held it out to me.

I took it, and raised it so the Airborne across the street could see it - I'd accepted his surrender.

K: "WEBLEY, GET TROOPS OVER HERE, WE NEED TO EVACUATE THE HERDIETS!" I called to her.

Webley: "ON IT!" And in short order, soldiers started coming out of the woodworks, slowly.

Major Asimov indicated to the remaining troops that they had surrendered, and called for a Sergeant to relay this message to the defenders in the palace.

K: "Have your ponies come out and stack their arms over there." I nodded to a few open crates. "We'll get you on some vehicle transports, and evacuated from the battle zone immediately." I put a hand on his shoudler. "You've surrendered to me, personally, as General-Field Marshal of Equestria. I will take my duty in protecting the lives of your ponies, as though they were my own."

Maj. Asimov: "Legends are true of you, then." He nodded. "Colonel Kenevelov was.. classmate.. in War College." He stood proudly. "Will be good to see him again, if possible."

K: "He's helping found a community in the far north of Equestria. Him and the other Herdiets that surrendered in Canida. If you like, I can see to it that you and your ponies are sent there. Get a new start in life." I nodded as the soldiers were rounded up.

Maj. Asimov: "Da. Would like that most of all. My ponies.. can return to being farmers and laborers. No more war. No fighting for the Political Elite in the Arkose that care little for their lives, only their victories." He snorted slightly.

K: "Bold words, Major." I smirked.

Maj. Asimov: "I am no longer bound by their Propaganda laws. I can speak my mind. Who better to do so, zan ze rival I surrendered to?" He chuckled.

K: "I like you, Major. If I survive this war, I will visit you." I declared.

Maj. Asimov: "Thank you, General." He nodded slowly.

We rounded up the troops, and radioed back to HQ that we'd secured the atomic warhead, and were retreating to the north-west. Aircraft and trucks would meet us there, to take us back behind the lines. While there were likely some civilian witnesses to what happened, the action had been so swift and violent, that it would be recorded as only a minor skirmish in the battle - most of the attention was focused on the Navarese Royal Army's advances along its two axies.

We'd managed to secure the atomic device, and STILL make things look like the Dukes had managed to do the heavy lifting.

Part 2: Civil Victory


TIME: 17:44 IT
DATE: War Day 814/28 Sextus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Royal Palace, Pamplona, Navarre

Instead of two days of heavy fighting, once the Anarchists learned that their Herdiet backup had been aced and surrendered, they began crumbling. Surrendering pockets of resistance, no longer encouraged to fight what was now a hopeless battle, caved in the front lines like candy before foals.

It took us all day, but the Anarchist faction leader, Josefina Durruti, and the 4th Battalion Commander, General Vicente de la Cerda, were both before us in the main plaza in front of the Royal Palace.

I hadn't realized it, but during the fight for the Atomic Weapon, I'd taken a grazing hit to my hip. The bullet - likely from Major Asimov himself - buried itself in my gear, and while it cut open my tender flesh, it was negligible. Still, I had once again been hurt doing stupid things.

I stood behind the Dukes as they prepared to take the surrender of the enemy.

Duke Alfonso: "On behalf of the Crown of Navarre, we jointly accept your surrender, General de la Cerda, Ms. Durruti." He nodded to Colonel Maria Espinoza, who stepped forwards.

Col. Espinoza: "General de la Cerda." She held out her hoof for his sword.

Gen. de la Cerda: "I object to handing my sword to this officer." He stared straight ahead but made no moves.

Duke Condor: "Colonel Espinoza is the Field Commander of the Royal Army." He stated. "She has every right to conduct this ceremony."

Gen. de la Cerda: "She is my daughter!" He hissed.

K: "Would you rather surrender to the North Equus Independent Group of Herds Treaty Organization, General de la Cerda? Outsiders?" I said, shrugging.

Gen. de la Cerda: "Indeed." He narrowed his eyes.

K: "Alright." I nodded. "Commandant, as General de la Cerda refuses to surrender his sword to the enemy Commander in Chief, I likewise decline, but request you do so, on behalf of NEIGHTO." If he didn't want to surrender to his enemy's Commander in Chief, I had every reason to refuse to accept his sword, as Supreme Allied Commander of NEIGHTO, and designate my second to do so in my place - a disrespect for a disrespect.

Forest Spirit: "Fine." He nodded. "Then he shall do so to an officer of equal rank." And that would be a disrespect from Forest Spirit. "Brigadier Tankette Blinda."

She stepped forwards, and held out her hoof for General de la Cerda's sword.

Blinda: "As Commander of the Equestrian Royal Marines 1st Division, I acccept your surrender, and your sword, General de la Cerda." She had a neutral expression on, but her eyes were narrowed at him in disapproval.

Gen. de la Cerda: "Fine. I surrender my forces, and my sword to you, Brigadier Blinda of Equestria." He handed it over, grip first.

Blinda then walked over to Maria Espinoza and held the sword out to her.

Blinda: "On behalf of NEIGHTO and the honor of the Equestrian Royal Marines, I present the enemy commander's sword, Colonel Espinoza." She even bowed a little.

Maria took the sword and slid it into her belt.

Col. Espinoza: "I accept." She glared at her father. "Since the enemy of the crown hadn't the courage to hand it to me himself, I will accept it from Navarre's newest and best friends, instead." Procedurally, this was another slap in the face.

Durruti: "Duke Alfonso, Duke Condor, I surrender to you, willingly, and plea for mercy from the Throne of Navarre." She bowed before both of them, showing more integrity than General de la Cerda.

Duke Condor: "Your fate will be decided at a later time. For now, amigos, we are united as one herd of Ibex once again. We are familia." He put a hoof on her shoulder. "Let us never again let anything come between us to this extent."

Durruti: "Si." She nodded a little, and smiled very slightly.

The surrender.. I expected a hiccup. I expected Vicente to act out of turn. I expected him to end up disrespected like this. If he had any Royal station at all, he would be humiliated completely - in matters of honor, he had shown to be without any. In social circles before the collapse of the concept of honor and self respect, this was pretty significant.

He'd escape the Hangman's Noose, as the Dukes promised no executions, but he'd be imprisoned for his treason and disrespectful surrender - his lack of honor counting against him. If ever released, he would find himself shunned by polite society, for lacking the humility to surrender like a proper officer.

Of the 5,782 Navarese defenders, 2,374 survived unharmed and surrendered, an additional 1,244 were wounded and captured. The Navarese Royal Army sustained 1,025 dead or wounded. My Airborne operation sustained 2 killed in accidents upon landing, 2 dead in the firefight at the Cathedral, and 4 wounded.

We found later, that 144 civilians had been injured in the fighting, and 7 had died. This was an incredibly low number, considering the Anarchists hadn't allowed a full scale evacuation from the Capital prior to the attack.

We entered the Palace, and found that some minor looting had taken place by the Anarchists. Some paintings were clearly missing, some large tapestries, and some furniture - stolen or damaged.

Into the Throne Room we went.. and I looked around a little.

Webley: "Swanky place!" She was chipper. "Oh! Ahhhh.. K, my.. my reception is clear. I feel.. light!" She grinned broadly. "The danger is all gone, now."

Toola: "I agree." She said, pacing in, and looking around. "Swanky is the word I'd use." She said, examining the throne. "Oh, wow.. K... this is real gold. And jewels." She gently sniffed at it.

Rarity: "Mmm.. Melt value is 1,325,678 Bits at current market rates, Darling." She gave it a look. "Maybe a bit more if the core of it is also precious metal." She smirked at me.

Twilight: "I'm just glad this is all over." She sighed.

Opalfire: "Me, too." She patted Twilight on the back.

Spike: "Me, three!" He grinned, though.

Applejack: "Them winds messed up the landin' somethin' fierce, though." She sighed. "Ah'm jes' glad yer alright." She patted my hip.

K: "OW!" This was when I noticed the injury mentioned before. "Sonova.." I pulled part of my gear belt back, and found my pants were wet with blood. "Fluttershy!"

She came over, sat me down, and we got my gear off. Then, my pants part-way down. Sure enough, there was a score of flesh missing, and Applejack dug out a 7.92mm pistol bullet from my utility pouch, embedded in a folded map.

Fluttershy: "Let me make sure you're not leaking anywhere else." She said, after stuffing the wound with antiseptic gauze, and having Applejack hold it firmly in place. "Hmm.. doesn't seem to be.." She patted my face. "Nope, that's it. Nothing serious, but you should get that stitched up."

Applejack: "Ah'll get some tape on it." She did just that.

Twilight: "You sure get yourself hurt a lot!" She giggled a little.

Sunset: "Really?" She paced over and had a look herself. "Yeah. I guess that explains all the scars you have. You didn't have those in Colorado." She shrugged.

K: "I've been shot, stabbed, beaten.. worse." I shrugged. "At least it's all over. All but the politics."

And that, of course, required a more delicate hand.

Part 3: Flight of the Falco

TIME: 14:45 IT
DATE: War Day 816/30 Sextus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Royal Palace, Pamplona, Navarre

I was seated at a table with Colonel Espinoza, my team, Princess Celestia, and a few other dignitaries, including Ambassador Fleur-de-Lis Capetians, of Prance. We knew he'd be here today.. actually, his arrival was over an hour late. We'd had a light lunch in the meantime, when Blinda came in.

Blinda: "He's entering the city, now. As instructed, the Navarese Royal Army is standing in formation and at attention in the Plaza outside." She nodded to us.

K: "Get the Dukes. Show time." I nodded, and stood.

I was wearing my formal uniform, again. Most of us were. Rarity did make a pony version of my uniform for her and the girls, in the styles of the branches they technically represented. Everyone was all dressed up. We went out to the parade grounds of the Plaza de Roy, and awaited his approach.

At the signal of the spotter on the roof across the street, the Equestrian Royal Army Band struck up the chords of the Royal March - a common tune played for most royalty in North Equus, if they didn't elect to have their nation's anthem played, and a respectful tune in general.

We were going to greet him magnaninmously, as a fellow victor in the Civil War. Diplomacy first.

The Dukes joined me, also in formal duds, in matching colors and everything - presenting themselves as a united front.

General Falco came strutting in at the head of his forces, who were in a loose but acceptable formation. Some of them tried to straighten up as they saw the International Brigades in formal or cleaned-and-pressed uniforms.

Right on cue, a flight of F/A-1 Falcons from the Prench Air Force flew overhead, followed by one from Equestrian Fighter Command, and tailed by a B-1 LeMay engaging colored smoke in Navarese flag colors.

The Dukes stepped forwards, just ahead of me.

Falco marched up to them, and saluted with his riding crop to the brim of his hat.

As noted before, things like the riding crop can be seen as a rather lewd display in Pony culture, but there were acceptable reasons to carry or show one - a military/Royal Guard or marching band setting, as a staff of rank to invoke an image of discipline, is one. Marching Band riding crops are usually colored, however. Royal Guard crops in most of North Equus are gold or silver colored (usually a cloth wrap).

Falco's was black - that could be taken in a sexual context, or to denote an image of very strict discipline. This being a military formation, it's the latter. It also implies he's a slave driver and harsh taskmaster, to those outside of his command.

General Falco: "General Ferdinando Falco, Commander, 5th Army Battalion of the Kingdom of Navarre. Victor at Tarragona, Barcelona, Mataro, and Sabadell." A curt nod to the Dukes.

Duke Condor: "Duke Condor.."

Duke Alfonso: "..and Duke Alfonso.."

Duke Condor: "Representing the Throne of the Kingdom of Navarre, in the name of His Royal Majesty, King Alfonso VIII."

Duke Alfonso: "General Falco. We are pleased you could join us for our final victory over the rebel forces that took up arms against us." He nodded.

General Falco: "I see." He looked at me. "And what reason is there, that..." He paused to choose his words very carefully. "...outsider, and his comrades, are among us?"

Duke Condor: "It is through our friendship to the Ponies of the North Equus Independent Group of Herds Treaty Organization, that we have been the victors, here, and retaken our capital, defeated the Anarchists, defeated the forces of Tirek the Immortal Conqueror, defeated both the Marexist and Mooxist Socialists, built.. this grand army.. and freed ourselves of the forces that fought to destroy our home, General." He swept a hoof at the Navarese Royal Army.

General Falco: "I see. I did not think you were so weak as to need the help of outsiders. Especially ponies." He snorted just a little. "And him." Me, he meant.

Duke Alfonso: "Friendship is not a weakness, General. Moreover, our Ibex did the heavy fighting themselves - our friends merely supported us." He reared his head back, just a bit.

General Falco: "..indeed." He 'heffed' a bit. "Now, then. My troops require rest before we go out into the countryside and hunt down the remaining rebels, investigate any sympathizers, and hang the traitors."

Duke Alfonso: "Did you not hear us? The war is over, General." He nodded.

General Falco: "I heard that two Royal Officials have captured the capital, not that you have pacified the countryside. There are still enemies out there. Enemies from within. Ones that we must find, and stamp out." He narrowed his eyes, just a bit.

Duke Condor: "No, General. There will be no such reprisals. We have declared amnesty for all." He cleared his throat, a bit. "There will be no summary executions."

General Falco: "And on what authority do you do this?" He asked, still being formal.

Duke Alfonso: "As the two highest ranked Dukes of Navarre, representing the Throne of His Majesty, King Alfonso VIII." He retorted.

General Falco: "And the king is dead." He shrugged. "Your authority is not absolute."

Duke Condor: "It is as absolute as it needs to be, General. Now, we invite you and your soldiers to join us on our pathway towards peace." He said, trying to reign him in.

General Falco: "There can be no peace so long as sympathizers to the rebellions remain in our lands!" He stated. "I answer only to the King of Navarre - there is not one!" He raised his head a little. "Therefore, my troops and I will depart for-"

K: "Not, I think, today, General." I pointed behind him.

The 1st Airborne had taken up positions behind his troops, and Gendarmes were moving through the ranks, disarming them.

He whipped his gaze around, snarling, and lowering his head for a Ram Attack, pawing the ground, challengingly, at me.

General Falco: "YOU CURSE-BRINGING CREATURE!!" He leapt at me!

*GUNSHOT!*

The General fell dead, at my feet, a perfect hole through his head.

Applejack: "MAH HUSBAND!" She hissed, and holstered her Masterson revolver after a short twirl.

Duke Condor: "Ahh.. so much for Diplomacy!" He shook his head, swishing his horns. "We tried, Mariscal."

Duke Alfonso: "Indeed, si, we did." He shook his head as well, looking down at the very dead General Falco. "But, we cannot allow mass terror in our countryside.. we must mend bridges, not burn villages."

Duke Condor: "Si." He nodded.

K: "Nice shot, honey." I smirked. "Now, see, YOU'RE the one in trouble." I patted her flank gently.

Fluttershy: "Oohhh.. myy.." That wasn't a shy 'Oh My' from her.

K: "Well. Forest Spirit, Dukes, I think we can dismiss the formation, and everyone can relax. Chemical Lens and her husband, along with the other Gendarmes, can handle General Falco's troops - I'm sure they'd like some food and rest." I shrugged.

Forest Spirit: "Sure. I got things." He smirked.

K: "Excellent." I said, turning, and walking back towards the Palace, grabbing AJ by the tail in a very public display of 'This Is Mine' for all to see.. and on the way, I grabbed Fluttershy's tail, too..

..I do have two hands!

[End of Part 3]

Part 4: The Goat That Would Be King

TIME: 09:47 IT
DATE: War Day 817/1 Septimus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Royal Palace, Pamplona, Navarre

Post-Nut Clarity is a real thing. Guys, gals, and others, you know this. Once that lust is properly expended, your head is clear. In my case, I had clarity four times in one night, and got to taste how strawberry-banana mixes with apple. Pretty good, actually. Applejack had wanted a piece of Fluttershy ever since Fluttershy got a piece of me, and this just happened to be the perfect opportunity. Seeing them cuddle afterwards, before draping my big monkey arm over them, was just too cute (in a very lewd way).

The Dukes declared a week of celebration and feasting. Now that they had physical control of the Royal coffers, they had two of our own Forensic Accountants - Blitzen Bookskeeper and Tally Ho, both former co-workers of Chemical Lens, and Gendarmes officers - go through the Treasury and count what was there and what was not there.

They found that the vault had, indeed, been partly looted. As much as 3,000 pounds of gold bullion was missing - likely taken by the Anarchists to pay Tirek, or by other factions. While this left the Royal books a bit shorter than before, it was only about 10% of the Nation's reserve gold, its distribution carefully managed to prevent inflation.

A great deal of governmental recovery work would be needed to get Navarre back on its own four hooves, but between Equestria, Prance, and the other nations, it wouldn't take long. The International Brigades started to send forces back to their homelands, now that the majority of the fighting was over.

But.. the big question remained. Navarre needed a leader. The King and his son, the Dauphin Prince, were dead. Duke Alfonso and Duke Condor were the two highest ranked nobles remaining, and according to their own rules of succession, had equal claim to the throne.

Both were silent, as myself, Celestia, Luna (who was getting rather tired at this point), Emperor Daishiro no Ken, and Princess Escargot sat before them in the Royal Planning room.

K: "As I understand your rules, in the event of a vacancy like this, both of you may claim the throne. Then, if you do, both must engage in a duel - winner-take-all." I shrugged.

Duke Condor: "I have been thinking, K. I wish to acceed." He nodded to his cousin. "Alfonso bears the family name, he should be the next king. He is fair, he is noble-"

Duke Alfonso: "Nonsense, Cousin! You are just as qualified as I! I wish to acceed!" He bowed a bit. "You were the one to accept K into your home, and the one to come to me, seeking peace!"

K: "This is what I was afraid of - you're both morally qualified to lead." I shrugged. "So much for Solomon's Baby."

Duke Condor: "K?"

K: "Ancient story from my religion. A King named Solomon is beseeched by two women claiming both to be the mother of an infant. To settle the question, Solomon offered to cleave the baby in half, so each could have an equal portion of it. Distraught, one of the women gave up. The other demanded the baby divided. The one who would rather give up the child rather than see it harmed, was declared the true mother and given the child. Based on the idea that no true parent would ever want their child harmed. It applies on larger scales, too.. like Kingdoms. No true King would ever wish to see their Kingdom split against itself or come to harm, and would rather give up their crown, than have that happen." I gestured to both of them. "You already did that - I didn't need to ask. That means, you're both morally qualified for the job."

Celestia: "Which means, as your friends, we need to figure out a way to make this work." She shrugged her wings.

Duke Alfonso: "We think we have come to know you, K. Have you a solution?" He swished his horns back, a bit.

K: "Yes. We'll start by rounding up all the remaining Royalty, vetting them to make sure they haven't participated in the Civil War, then see where we stand. If there's at least two thirds of them remaining and trustworthy, I'd say we have Quorum. And we ask them to vote on the next King." I gestured. "If this results in a tie, or there's not enough of-age, recognized royals to form a Quorum, then we wait for the National Assembly to be reorganized. They vote. If there's still no decision, then we canvas the nation and gather the vote of every citizen above the age of 18 - and any veterans that served honorably, regardless of age. If it comes to that, the two of you will sequester yourselves, so as not to influence the vote, and the election will be handled by a neutral party." I gestured.

Emperor no Ken: "Dis is de prlan K laid out to me before rleaving fo' de Mirror World." He shrugged.

Duke Alfonso: "Forgive us, K, but that could take months." He looked at his cousin.

Duke Condor: "Navarre needs a leader now." He lowered his head, then raised it. "Duel?"

Duke Alfonso: "I am afraid that is the fastest way. First blood?" He stepped down to the gallery near the main hall door.

Duke Condor: "Suitable." He did the same, and both started stripping off their uniforms.

Princess Escargot: "Dukes! Please! You needn't do zis!" She implored.

Duke Alfonso: "This is not the first time we have done this, Princess. When our kingdom was first united, the rules were the same, the situation the same - both wishing what is best, both needing an immediate decision to prevent a calamity. In this case, we fight not for personal glory.. for, you see, it will be the one who is wounded, who will be king! As it was last time." He already had his fencing rapier out, and was taking practice swings.

Duke Condor: "We will fight our fiercest." He was also prepping. "It would be a disgrace to lose." He smirked.

K: "Well, I'll be damned." I shrugged. "When you said there was a duel in your past to determine the outcome of.. something like this.. I didn't think you meant the rules were THIS way - I thought it was WINNER-take-all, not Loser-becomes-King!" I chuckled. "Selfess Victory! I love it." I gestured to everyone. "Let us watch history in the making. Blinda? Go lock the door, eh?"

She did just that, and took position as the Referee.

Blinda: "If you gentlemen don't mind?" She asked.

They both shook their heads 'no' and bowed to her, recognizing her position.

Blinda: "This duel will be to First Blood." She held a hoof up. "Take positions.." She motioned them both forwards. "..ready.. and.. EN GARDE!"

They didn't speak, the entire time. They did, however, fight fiercely. Horns were used as much as the blade in their mouths. Kicks applied with equal precision as blade thrusts. They were both gallant fighters, and both very skilled at this, you could tell.

They were also holding back.

I finally stood up, after about five minutes of watching them go back and forth, and stripped off my gun belt and sword, grabbing a fencing rapier from the wall, and taking a few practice swings with it.

K: "You two are holding back!" I finally declared.

Duke Condor: *Huff-Puff* "Perhaps we are!"

Duke Alfonso: *Puff-Huff* "This is first blood, not to the death!"

K: "And you've been fighting for five minutes without result." I stood before them. "Time for some decisive action - First Blood still applies. I get you, you're King. You get me, the other guy's King. Now.. EN GARDE!"

I'm a poor swordsman. However, this is exactly the kind of swordfighting that J-- had trained me on. THIS.. I could hold my own on.

Sorta. It's two-on-one.

They also aren't holding back any more.

I managed to kick Duke Alfonso in the face right off the bat, and smack Duke Condor in the face with the pommel of the Rapier, then shove them both back HARD. They both rolled up with blades forward, and we clashed.. I held them off with both hands on the blade. Only, they were - combined - stronger than me. I had to disengage.

I snapped my blade down and away, letting them trip up, and I moved between them, to try and get a flank shot. Duke Condor interceded and prevented me from getting his cousin in the tail zone. He clashed, as Duke Alfonso recovered, and tried to get around to my side.

I flexed, and lunged, but aborted the lunge halfway and moved to a guard. This caused both of them to collide with each other. I fell back, as Duke Alfonso recovered first, and took a swipe at me. I clashed with him, trying to push him back and keep them both bunched up, but Duke Condor rammed me in the legs (lower center of gravity), and knocked me down.

I rolled, and lunged from the ground, getting him in the back flank - and at the same moment, Duke Alfonso managed to stab me in that arm. An attempt to prevent the thrust, but the angle misjudged.

K: "EEEOOWW!" I dropped the rapier. "That stings!"

Blinda: "Duke Condor is the winner." She announced. "Both because Duke Alfonso stabbed K in the arm, and because K stabbed Duke Condor in the flank."

Duke Condor: "Yess.. sword wounds do hurt." He looked at his butt, and it was bleeding. "Methinks.. seating on the throne.. will be a pain.. for a bit." He three-leg hobbled over to me and Alfonso as Alfonso helped me up. "You fight well, K. Cousin." He bowed to them both.

Duke Alfonso: "I am satisfied. Two clean points." He bowed to his cousin, and me.

K: "Fluttershy!" I called out as Blinda unlocked the door and opened it. "I need a medic!"

At least the question was settled, somewhat traditionally...

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Return To Civility

TIME: 11:55 IT
DATE: War Day 827/11 Septimus, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Royal Palace, Pamplona, Navarre


Ten days had passed since it was decided that Condor would be King. Five had passed since his Accession to the Throne as King Condor-Alfonso I. He had insisted on taking the Alfonso family name, to inspire the kingdom with the ideals that Alfonso VIII once held.

Two months from now would be his formal ceremony.

He named Duke Alfonso as his chosen successor, should his children not come of age in time. Now-Prince Alfonso, in return, named King Condor's children as his successor. The stitching together that King Alfonso had once desired, was happening, healing from the civil war.

Maria Espinoza was conferred the rank of Brigadier General, and both King Condor and Prince Alfonso asked if she could be allowed to shadow Sacquet, Blinda, and Forest Spirit, to learn "how to General" better. By default, she commanded the Navarese Army.

The other, more minor factions, came one by one to the table of peace, and signed treaties of Status Quo Ante Bellum, or White Peace. All were pardoned by King Condor. Josefina Durruti and the other major faction leaders that we'd captured in battle were given commuted sentences, but made Persona Non Grata in Government office. General de la Cerda.. that is, Vicente de la Cerda.. was stripped of his rank and status, and sentenced to five years of "community rehabilitation." That is, he was ordered to serve the poor and destitute from the war - bring them food, repair their broken homes, things like that.

General Falco would go down in history as a would-be Tyrant, with tales of vicious atrocity against any seen as betrayers to The Throne of Navarre, but singe-hoofedly. Everyone knew, now, that he did this on his own, in his own quest to rid his land of who he saw as traitors - by flame and rope, his black zeal breaking many lives.

NEIGHTO was putting the finishing touches on Technical Data Packages being transferred to new NEIGHTO members, Navarre and Lusitania. King Condor kept his word, and additionally, sent two Battalions of Navarese troops on a tour through Europe to train under the Prench, Germanes, Ambleonians, and Polelish.

Me? I was relaxing in our guest quarters, sprawled out on the bed, Applejack laying across my chest.

K: "It's nice to have some peace." I said, stroking her mane.

Applejack: "Yuh-huh.. naice t'jes.. relax t'gether." She held me close.

We're both clothed, more or less.. my shoes and socks are off, though, and she's not wearing a shirt.

K: "That was a rough couple of months." I nodded. "Three months of fighting."

Applejack: "Mm.. glad that's over." She sighed. "An' we done some darn good work against Tirek."

K: "Yeah. I'm prescribing rest for all involved units for at least thirty days." I kissed her forehead. "Us, too. We went through a lot. We need to relax and take our minds off of this."

Applejack: "Yeah." She half straddled me, and just.. sank down all over me like melting butter. "We needs it. B'tween whut happened to Twai, th' Rainbow Factory.. the fightin' never goin' t'plan.. all'a it."

K: "Yup." I let my arms flop completely out to the sides.

Applejack: "..enough'a this. I wanna git drunk." She kissed me and got up off of me, pulling on her uniform undershirt.

K: "You know I don't. And, you know this is going to end us right back in this bed in a few hours." I smirked, and tugged her tail a bit.

Applejack: *LUSTILY!* "..that's part'a th' point, sugah.." She winked at me.

K: "Ooo.. real couples time. I love it!" I slid out of bed with her, and got my shoes and socks on.

We went down stairs, and met Firecracker on the way.

Applejack: "Hey, 'cracker." She smirked a bit. "Y'all know if'n the Dukes got any liquid relaxations aroun' here?"

Firecracker Burst: "Ah.. I.. generally don't drink that." She patted her horn a bit. "I did, once, and burned down a bar by accident.. ah.." She shrugged. "Sorry, ma'am."

Applejack: "Aw, don't git t'callin' me 'ma'am' - we're friends! C'mon. AJ's fahn." She patted her on the back.

Firecracker Burst: "AJ. Alright." She smiled a bit. "Ah, you might ask Rarity.. I think she was saying something about trying the Navarse wines."

Applejack: "Sounds fun! C'mon, Honey!" She took off at a chipper pace.

K: "Thanks Firecracker." I nodded and followed.

After we got downstairs, and almost to the basement, we could hear Rarity talking in the distance.

K: "She's a good pony." I nodded.

Applejack: "Shore is. Wish we'd had her on th' team sooner." She shrugged. "Hope she moves t'Ponyville after th' war, or comes visits."

K: "Well, she IS from up-state Erie." I gestured. "Rarity!" I called out.

Rarity: "D-Down here, Darlings.." Her 'drunk voice.'

Applejack: *Quietly* "I wan'cha all t'm'self, got me?" She murmured, as we got to the Wine Cellar.

K: "No problem, Honey.." I smirked, and gently slapped her flank.

We found Rarity, flat on her back, with three empty wine bottles of different types. Tasting..? Heck, no. She chugged, as the drips down the sides of her mouth, showed.

K: "Rarity. Did you get drunk?" I knelt down by her, and helped her on to a bench.

Rarity: "Drunk. Mm. Yes, I suppose.. *URP!* ..I did!" She grabbed a full bottle, matching one of the empty ones. "Applesshhhack.." She pushed it into her hooves. "..itsshh. Itshh made with apples, dearie, you'll love thissh one."

AJ uncorked it with her teeth, but actually made a show of using Rarity's discarded wine glass to pour.. sniff.. swish.. sniff again.. and gently taste.. all the while looking at me.

Applejack: "Mmm. Some kinda petit apple. Strong flavor, bit too much bite. Th' grapes tame it some.. very sweet grapes.." She nodded a bit, and finished the glass like a refined lady.

She was teasing me.

I sat next to Rarity, and watched.

Rarity: "Ishn't it.. just.. lovely?" She smirked.

K: "Rarity.. you know.. I notice you just love wine." I shrugged.

Rarity: "Mmh.. yeshh. Wine issh.. so nice.." She swayed a bit.

K: "You don't drink to forget things, do you?" I kept her from falling over.

Rarity: "Heavenshh no!" She sat upright. "Wine isshh.. a celebration! It ish.. what we have.. when we are happy.. annnnd have friendshh.." She giggled like a loon. "Never.. never drink when you're sad.." She patted my face.

Twilight came down with Spike, about then.

Twilight: "Oh, K!" She saw AJ pouring another glass of that apple wine. "Ahh.."

K: "Get Rarity to her guest quarters, will you? AJ and I are tasting wines." I smiled - meaning, she was having wine and I'd be tasting, later.

Twilight: "OH! Oh." She nudged Spike.

Spike: "I get it! You two want Married Ponies Time." He gave me the biggest Bro Grin, ever - our little Dragon was growing up.

K: "Smart lad, Spike." I helped him get Rarity up and leaned properly into him. "You should really take Smolder on a date."

Spike: "I should, huh?" He grinned.. then blushed - hard.

Twilight: "Yeeeahh.." She patted him on the shoulder. "..trust me, K, he's no little boy any more." She looked down at him, somewhat teasingly. "Are you?"

Spike: "Ah.. I.. uh.. we.." He was beet red.

Twilight: "Buuuut.. they haven't gone past.. what did you call it, years ago? Second base." She helped Rarity up the stiars. "Have fun, you two!"

I looked at Spike as he was departing - a little humiliated, but..

K: "Wait for the home run until you're older, buddy. Okay?" I said, seriously-toned.

Spike: "Ah. Thanks.." He gave a proud grin. "..you're a great Uncle, K."

K: "I try." I nodded, watching Applejack down her third glass in a most refined manner. "Go on, now.. and lock the door."

Applejack splayed across my lap, now actually sipping the wine, not chucking it back.

Applejack: "Mmmmmmmmm.. jes' right. Warm in mah belly, tastin' good in mah mouth.." She nuzzled my belly area. "We don't git time enough like this."

K: "Need to make time.." I nodded. "We need to make time."

Applejack: "Mmmmmmmmmmmm.." She vibrated that into my belly button. "Ah love yew so much." She cuddled me a bit, reached back to finish her current glass, then went back to cuddling. "Also.. that stuff thar's about th' same proof as Granny Smith's mason jar moonshine."

Which means, for a wine, it was incredibly strong, verging on a liquor. This would make it a Fortified, Aromatized Wine. And.. probably about 70 Proof. Was it still a Wine, or was it something else, now?

K: "Rarity probably got in over her head with that.." I looked down at AJ. "Truth. How much spirits were you used to, and how much do you know about it?"

Applejack: "Mac 'n I used to have a cider after ever day'a workin' the farm. Two durin' Buckin' Season." She nodded. "We brewed our own Farmhouse Ale, Cider, and Mead all th' time. An' Granny with her 'Shine. Ain't no laws agin' it." She snuggled me a bit. "So, yeah, I know all 'bout liquor. An' I'm.. well.. was kinda used to havin' some almost ever day."

K: "Low quantities, though, and low alcohol content." I shrugged, leaning back.

Applejack: "Yeah." She looked up at me, then pulled me into a deep kiss.

Tasted like fermented apples and sugary grapes.. not terrible, but I could taste the alcohol on her breath, and I'm not one that cares for it. She knows that, though.

Then, she straddled me.

K: "Oh?" I slipped her shirt off - I knew where this was going.

Applejack: "Ah'm buzzed jes' right.." She murmured seductively. "..let's get civil."

There's one thing about Applejack.. she LOVES having sex while buzzed or drunk. Since it dulls the senses, she can keep up with my sexual fortitude better. Otherwise, she generally wants a partner. Because, for us, we aren't done having sex until we're both absolutely spent.

This is Relationship Goals, here. I was so lucky to end up with just the right Pony...
