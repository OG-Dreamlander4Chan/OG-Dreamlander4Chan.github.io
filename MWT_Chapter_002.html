Chapter 2: To the Skies

Part 1: Bridle Idle

TIME: 18:30 NERST
DATE: Redemption Day 3/9 Septimus, 2054 C.S.
LOCATION: Crystal Tea Room, Bridlewood, Erie, New Equestria

So, here I was. Back in Equestria. One thousand years (and change) after all hell broke loose. Literally. We were fending off monsters of all kinds that were made of some kind of darkness. To make matters worse, only a CHUNK of the north-east was in a safe sort of bubble, bordered by Ley Line barriers, that prevented anyone from really exiting, except by sea.

Alphabittle: "..and I know we don't have much trade with Europe." He shrugged. "I have a few imported European teas, but they're expensive and hard to get."

K: "So, basically, we're almost totally cut off from the world." I nodded.

Alphabittle: "Yes, General." He shook his head.

K: "No, no, you call me K, got it?" I smiled. "I never stood on formality, with friends." I patted his shoulder "This is the best Red Fireleaf Tea I've ever had."

Alphabittle: "Mmm. From my personal plants." He looked over as Hitch, Sunny, and Izzy were having tea and a snack at his bar. "More Macaroons, K?" He offered the plate.

K: "Surf's up." I smirked and nibbled one.

Alphabittle: "If I may advise, K.." He asked, humbly. "I'd suggest you go meet the Prime Minister, next, actually. And you might catch Princess Theia, as well." He shrugged.

K: "Where at?" I nodded to him.

Alphabittle: "Zephyr Heights. Let me get you a map.." He ducked under his bar, and rifled through some things, before presenting an old, cloth map. "Here." He tapped his hoof on it.

K: "..Zephyr Heights?" I cocked a brow. "That's Old Mount Baldy. That's New Cloudsdale." I frowned. "I wonder why the name was changed." I shook my head. "During the war, Cloudsdale was destroyed by some of Tirek's goons. The clouds were all obliterated. It took the Pegasi community years to gather enough to rebuild the city, and when they did, they anchored it to Old Mount Baldy in Greenbrooke." And tapped the map.

Alphabittle: "It's been Zephyr Heights for as long as I've known it." He shook his head. "Sorry, K. I just don't know where it went wrong."

I was reminded of Derpy. No, no, I can't go on thinking about the past so much...

K: "Either way, there's no getting there tonight." I shrugged.

Alphabittle: "Of course. You can stay at my place. You and your friends. In the morning, I'll crack open the Arsenal and Quartermaster and get you as equipped as I can." He nodded. "You can leave your extra things with me, until you get established."

K: "Sounds wonderful." I smiled. "So, these darkness creatures. Is that the only threat?"

Alphabittle: "No.. it's.. some of the wildlife have become tainted by it, and violent. A lot of smaller towns were abandoned after they attacked them." He shrugged. "I've done what I can. But, the truth is, the Combat Commands that exist, don't really cooperate much. The Combat Command covering Greenbrooke, New Hamster, and Maine is dominated by the Air Force. They have some militia forces in each town, but security is handled by the 40th Composite Security Group, which has the 1st and 2nd Security Forces Wings, and the 3rd Security Investigations Wing."

I recalled that I had originally designated Air Force land units the same as the Army. In this case, a "Wing" was equal to a Battalion (of 1080 troops), and a "Group" is equal to a Brigade (3240 troops, or 3 Battalions). The 40th Composite Security Group would be based in Greenbrooke, if my numbering system was still used.

K: "So, the 40th handles most of the security for Greenbrooke, New Hamster, and Maine by itself?" I shrugged. "With two land Wings, that's cutting it a bit thin, yeah?"

Alphabittle: "Well, there aren't as many settlements up there as there are elsewhere." He shrugged. "Most of the population lives in Zephyr Heights. The 40th stations a Squadron in each major settlement. There's eight in the region, and one does Patrol duties. Each settlement has a Militia unit, too. The 40-3rd Investigations Wing handles all the crime there, and there's almost no Gendarmes units as a result." He looked at Hitch. "However, Maresechusetts, Rowed Island, and Cobnecticut rely heavily on the Gendarmes and their own town militia units. Whereas here in Erie, Docksylvania, and New Jersey, it's the Army." He sighed. "There's only two combat regiments of Marines left, but we work with them."

K: "And how do you handle crime in your Command?" I said, more or less presumptively declaring him Area Commander based on his attitude so far.. and maybe a bit of nepotism.

Alphabittle: "The Brigade Support Regiments each have a Military Police Company, and we have some Military Police Investigations personnel from an office that used to be based at Fort Drummet." He shrugged. "I mean, it's been a thousand years, K." He sighed, and refilled my tea. "What we have is what we have. We try to make do and protect who and what we can."

K: "I understand." I said, softly. "I'm not looking for anyone to blame - that gets us nowhere - what I'm looking for is answers and information." I nodded. "I need to know what's left, so I know where to start to rebuild."

Alphabittle: "So, you're going to try to rebuild everything?" He leaned back with a smirk. "That's a tall order." He chuckled.

K: "I know I can do it. I started last time with nothing at all, and we beat Tirek." I nodded firmly. "Together. As friends. This time?" I looked over at Sunny, Hitch, and Izzy. "I'm starting with not just some army, I've got a new generation of talented, loving, friendly, smart, wholesome, wonderful little ponies.." I turned back to him. "..and a few older ones like me." I leaned over and gave him a bro-tap on the shoulder, making him chuckle. "I know we can do this, Bit." I nodded, smiling. "Whatever it is I need to do, here, to save everyone. I'll do it. Even if I die in the process."

Alphabittle: "Just like last time?" He nodded, with an admiring smirk.

K: "Just like last time." I stuck out my hand, palm open. "Together."

We shook on it.

After a while, Alphabittle took us back to his house. As with most homes here, it was part of a tree. Izzy had her own place, and just parted from us after we got to Alphabittle's (they were sort of neighbors).

Izzy: "It kiiinda feels weird to come right back home like this, buuuut..." She shrugged and flamboyantly whipped her left foreleg to her brow, and waved good bye to us. "See ya in the morning!" And practically bounced off.

K: "..she has so much energy." I smirked.

Alphabittle: "No kidding!" He chuckled. "It'll be a real special stallion or mare that manages to tame that one!" He led us in.

Hitch: "Thanks for putting us up, General." He shrugged.

Sunny: "Yeah, we really appreciate it." She bowed a bit as they entered.

Alphabittle: "Well, if K's here, that means it's time for this old stallion to get ready for changes. If that means opening my home to the Human and his friends, helping them, mentoring them, whatever. I have a responsibility to help." He shrugged.

K: "..what's this room, here, Alphabittle?" I nodded to the closed door.

Alphabittle: "Ah." He nodded.. and lowered his head. "I know your rule, K. No secrets. Secrets kill." He gestured to the dining room. "Let me feed you properly, and I'll explain everything."

K: "Alright." I shrugged.

Alphabittle made a simple macaroni and cheese. For me, he added ham bits to it - and boy was that a welcome addition. The cheese was unusual and creamy, but I thought better than to ask its origins. He also hastily steamed some carrots and potatoes for us, and an herbal caffeine-free tea.

K: "This is delicious." I said, digging right in.

Hitch: "Boy, is it!" He smiled.

Sunny: "Yeah, I'm the one that has to cook for you, or you're just eating diner food all the time." She nudged him.

Both Alphabittle and I exchanged wiggled eyebrows and tiny grins, knowing darn well what this kind of exchange meant.

Alphabittle: "I.. have a daughter, K." He lowered his head a bit. "When she was very small, I found she.. had some kind of a gift. She was special. Very special. Princess Theia's mentor was in town, so, I asked her about it.." He frowned. "..and she said that my daughter was the key. That she could possibly save us all." He looked up to me. "You had foals. If you were told one of them would be the key to saving the world, but you had to give them up..?" He tilted his head.

K: "You chose Ponykind over your flesh and blood." I lowered my head. "You know, I'll be honest, Alphabittle, I don't think I could have done that."

Alphabittle: "Theia's mentor.. arranged to have her taken. She said it was best that I didn't know the details." He sniffled a bit. "I haven't seen her since. That door leads to her room."

K: "I'm guessing this was all very, very sudden." I pressed.

Alphabittle: "Incredibly so." He shrugged. "As soon as I spoke to her, she told me immediately that she needed to take my daughter and educate her straight away. I had.. seconds.. to make the choice." He looked up. "I will say I've regretted it ever since. I thought it might be for a couple of months, or maybe a year or two."

K: "And..?" I asked.

Alphabittle: "It's been 15 years. She'd be 21 now." He shrugged. "Understand, Theia's mentor does not make public appearances. She's a very private person. We know who she is just as that. I don't even know her proper name. The only thing I know for sure is that she's an Alicorn." And finally looked me in the eye. "Did I make a mistake? As a.. a father."

K: "I can't say, man." I patted his shoulder. "I'll be honest, I didn't know there were other Alicorns besides Celestia, Luna, Cadence, Sunset, and Theia. But, if she's old enough to be Theia's mentor, then, she must be very old indeed. And that means she's in a position to know things the rest of us wouldn't, or might not even understand." I gestured. "If Theia trusts her, then I can only presume that her judgment is sound. I was only there for part of Theia's early life, but I did teach Luna my ways, and then there was my wife, Applejack.."

Sunny: "My ancestor." She nodded. "That's why I call him Grandpa." She smiled.

K: "..exactly. Theia would have been raised around veterans, people I trusted with my life, people I trained. I can only hope she turned out as wise and intelligent as I'd hoped." I shrugged, finishing my carrots. "And thus, this Mentor is as smart and trustworthy as my old team was. That being the case.. you may have done the right thing as a leader of ponykind, but the wrong thing as a father. And those two things aren't easy to reconcile." I frowned, and sipped the tea.

After dinner, the rest of which I spent telling stories of the Tirek War, Alphabittle showed us to the guest room.

Alphabittle: "See you in the morning." He nodded.

K: "Thanks again, Alphabittle." I smiled.

Hitch: "Hm. Bed, couch.. and.." He blinked.

K: "I'll be fine where ever." I shrugged.

Sunny: "Well. Grandpa can sleep with me." She nodded. "At least Hitch sleeping on the couch is better than him falling asleep at his desk and in is chair. Again."

K: "Bad habit." I shrugged, and patted him on the head. "You'll ruin your back."

Hitch: "It's n-not THAT often!" He snorted.

Sunny: "Yeah, it's only three or four times a week." She frowned. "I've told you before, you don't have to sleep there. You can come stay at the Brighthouse. We've known each other all our lives, Hitch. My home is your home, too." She nodded to him.

K: "Mmm." I smiled a bit, and just slid into bed. "I will need to find a tailor. I have a couple of changes of clothes, but combat conditions are going to ruin them fast." I shrugged, as Sunny laid down across my chest. "Granddaughter."

Sunny: "I have to admit, Grandpa.. for the first time in a long time.. I feel really comfortable. You're here, Hitch is here, we met Izzy and the others.." She sighed. "..I have family, again, and lots of new friends."

K: "And as I always say - Friendship is Magic." I smirked.

Part 2: Bridle Gear

TIME: 07:30 NERST
DATE: Redemption Day 4/10 Septimus, 2054 C.S.
LOCATION: Alphabittle's, Bridlewood, Erie, New Equestria


I awoke at 7:30, and sat up, realizing everyone'd gotten up before me. I was rusty, I needed to blow the dust off and get back in shape. Somehow, some way, this world was depending on me.

Also, Hitch snores. Bad. I had to grab a broom and poke his flank twice to get him to roll over and not sleep on his back. Sunny was curled up to me protectively - as though -I- was the one that needed protecting. Maybe I did? I was certainly not the same man I was when I defeated Tirek.

I got dressed again, and went down to the dining room. They were just setting the table.

K: "Should've gotten me up at zero-six-thirty, I would've helped." I smirked.

Sunny: "Grandpa! You need your rest - you're brand new back here, and you're in no condition." She frowned a bit.

Natural leader indeed. She was bypassing military chain of command and asserting her authority as my caretaker and family to make sure I didn't do what I always did - push myself too hard. Again. More.

I surrendered, and sat down.

K: "Don't treat me like glass. I'm middle aged, not elderly." I shrugged.

Hitch: "She does the same thing to me - and I outrank her, too." He lowered his head momentarily, almost ducking away from her as she sat pancakes down before us.

Alphabittle: "I'm eager to try these." He smiled.

Hitch: "Sunny makes the best pancakes in the kingdom!" He smiled.

Sunny: "Oh, hush, they're not THAT good!" She blushed, a bit, though.

Again, Alphabittle and I exchanged looks.

After breakfast, we headed to the 1st Division Armory. The division had a proper military base on the outskirts of town in the north, though it was very carefully festooned in nature. Even the mechanized unit parking lot was carefully fitted to the terrain.

Tree Hugger would have loved this.

Inside the armory building, I was immediately greeted with salutes, which I returned.

Alphabittle: "Who's duty sergeant, today?" He nodded.

Jasper: "Me, General." He nodded to me. "General K." He saluted. "I'm ah.. Jasper. Technician Third Class." He nodded to the inverted chevron on his uniform.

K: "New wrinkle." I nodded to Alphabittle.

Alphabittle: "We added Special Technical ranks to the military after the Apocalypse. They defer to an NCO in combat, but have authority in situations like this one - work details." He pointed to the door. "Best let General K in, so he can see our new equipment."

Jasper did as instructed, and bowed a bit to me as I entered.

I passed him and gave him a smile - he was a bit emo-styled, under his uniform, and it struck me that Unicorns especially would have suffered without magic, and they likely WERE harboring some mental illness as a result. Cultural depression? It made sense.

Alphabittle led me over to the equipment lockers and took out a pair of odd gloves that had articulated fingers on them. I  hadn't paid attention, but Hitch had a pair as well, and had them on when he came to save me.

Alphabittle: "About a hundred years ago, we came up with these. We had other models before this, but, this gives us ponies the ability to pick things up like.. well.. you." He shrugged. "There's a set of boot covers that goes with them. It's part of our Future Combat System, even though it's a century old." He demonstrated by putting on a set, and standing on his hind legs. Doing so, he was a bit taller than me. "See? Now we can walk on two legs and handle weapons with our forelimbs."

Hitch had put his set on, and mimic'd Alphabittle.

Hitch: "I can't tell you the number of times this has come in handy." He nodded. "We call the gloves Titan's Mitts. They work with our grip field."

K: "The very low level magic of grip fields still exists, then." I nodded. "You weren't totally reduced to just talking horses with no ability to manipulate your environments."

Hitch: "Yeah." He nodded. "One thing I can say - everyone has these. And if we don't, we have trigger kits that attach to the weapons that let us fire them without the gloves. It extends the trigger into a long bar, kinda like the really old weapons from the Tirek War." He lowered himself back down, demonstrating that the 'hands' would splay out totally, allowing them to walk four-hooved if they didn't need to carry a weapon.

K: "This all makes a lot of sense." I nodded to them both.

Alphabittle: "Mmm. Let me show you our weapons. We have almost everything here." He went to the attachments lockers, and opened them. "This here, you already saw - Hitch's Manticore, and the one he gave you, have the Hydra grenade launcher on it." He pointed it out, and I noted that the Titan's Mitt finger articulated to point the first finger. "Second, we have the Flashbee. It's an electrical projector. A stream of electrically conductive chemical is sprayed from a nozzle, here, and the electrical discharge comes from here and here, sending a short arc of electricity. 1000 volts at 2 amps at full power." He nodded.

K: "That's lethal." I shrugged.

Alphabittle: "Half power is more like a heavy stun effect." He nodded. "It gets 30 shots at full power. 45 at half. The capacitor isn't completely efficient, of course."

K: "I get it." I nodded.

Hitch: "That there.." He pointed. "..is the Phoenix. It's set up as a flamethrower normally, but it can fire different chemicals, too. I have one at the Sheriff's Station in Maretime Bay set up to fire a glue mixture." He smirked. "The glue stays very fluid for a couple seconds, then as it dries, it gets very sticky. Excellent for catching the occasional crook." He shrugged.

K: "Interesting." I said, going over to what was clearly a shotgun. "Underbarrel shotgun." I nodded. "Shell types?"

Alphabittle: "7mm shot, 40 gram slug, flares, FRAG-12 shotgun grenades, door breacher shells, we have all kinds." He nodded. "It takes ejectable short tube magazines holding two shells. You can hoof load a third."

K: "Cool." I nodded. "And I see the Manticore has a carbine version." I pointed to one on the table, partly disassembled.

Alphabittle: "Sure does." He smiled. "I know back in the war, we had sub-machine guns. With this, we don't really need them."

K: "Makes sense." I nodded. "I like all of this. You've all done some amazing stuff, here." I gestured to it all.

Alphabittle: "We don't have a lot of fuel right now, but I can get you transport to the edge of my command area. You'll have to walk to Zephyr Heights from there." He shrugged. "I'm sorry."

K: "No, no, it's fine. It'd take me ages to walk the whole distance." I nodded. "It's something like 120 miles - or about 200 kilometers. That'd be over 10 days walk for me."

Alphabittle: "I can get you as far as Cupcake Falls, on the border to Maresechusetts. There's riverboats along the Husatonic River on occasion, so, you can get almost all the way there, by river. Should cut your time down by a lot." He nodded.

Hitch: "Yeah, we.. we don't have many vehicles in that area." He shrugged. "I have a pickup truck, but I don't get much gas for it. There's only two refineries in New Equestria, and one of them has constant problems."

K: "Which one?" I nodded to Hitch.

Hitch: "The one at The Remnant - what used to be Baleston." He sighed.

K: "..I'm guessing Baleston is gone.." I said, grimly.

Hitch: "Almost, yeah." He frowned. "We can't use the port because of ley line fractures all over the place, and dark creatures took over the city." He shook his head. "The city was abandoned ages ago, but the industrial area by what used to be Braintree has that functional refinery and an off shore oil platform." He nodded. "That's where a lot of our gas comes from."

K: "Sad." I frowned. "Baleston was a nice place." I shrugged.

Hitch: "We can also get to Pitfield, too, and get some rest there. I know the Sheriff." He nodded.

K: "So, transport to Cupcake Falls, then walk to the Husatonic River, then up to Pitfield, maybe we get transport there." I shrugged.

Hitch: "Might. They do regular patrols." He nodded to me.

Izzy came in about then, and immediately went to the scrap pile and started digging around.

K: "Izzy. I'd really like it if you came with us - and joined my new Command Staff." I said, as she dug through some things.

Izzy: "Oh!" She bounced as she turned to face me. "REALLY!?" She beamed a grin.

Sunny: "Yeah, I mean.." She shrugged. "..we're friends." She smiled, and paced over to her, putting her hoof to her chest. "Hoof to heart."

The first time I'd ever heard that, and I didn't know it then, but it'd be our own catchphrase. Like "Science will Fuck you" used to be mine.

We spent some time gathering equipment. I took the Manticore + Hydra that had been given to me by Hitch, it was the least heavy. I also swapped my Browning out for a Roc, and we rigged a thigh rig for me. Sunny was an expert shot, so, she took a Manticore and one of the computerized sights. I noted they had a crate that should hold 15 of them, and had only that one to spare.

Alphabittle: "Canterlogic Industries supplies all of our high tech gear." He shrugged. "Lieutenant General Cloverleaf owns the company." And nodded to me. "She's senior officer of the military, right now, and Theia's defense advisor."

Hitch: "Yeah, her son is Undersheriff." He frowned. "He's actually in charge while I'm gone." He shrugged.

K: "I hope he's capable." I nodded.

Hitch and Sunny both looked at me with unease, and made placating, "so-so" gestures.

Sunny: "I've known him since we were foals." She frowned. "He's.. uhm.."

Hitch: "Spoiled." He spat it out.

I noted just how they were both approaching this. Interesting.

K: "..I think instituting discipline and retraining force-wide may be needed." I nodded.

Alphabittle: "It'd help." He shrugged.

Izzy took a Manticore with a Flashbee, and an extra battery and chemical bottle. I knew her enough by now to know, she had reasons. And they might not be as they first seem.

We got proper field packs, uniforms, and equipment, food, and canteens. Everything we'd need for an expedition. After gathering gear, Alphabittle even took me to the unit's uniform and laundry specialists and had them take measurements for me, for a set of uniforms. They weren't Rarity, but it'd do. They said they'd have them ready in the morning.

I spent the rest of the day getting a tour of the town by Izzy, with Hitch and Sunny. Sunny, as I was now with her, got to ask some questions of some of the other Unicorns, and actually get answers. Several of them regarded my coming as a miracle.. and to be honest, feeling them cheer up even a bit, at seeing me, made me feel like I was about to do something great. To help them.

Whatever it takes.

LOCATION: Departing Bridlewood, Erie, New Equestria


I finally had clothes. Something, at least. They fit well enough. A nice subdued green uniform, same material as everyone else, and one of my black T-Shirts. I'd have to wait to get to either Maretime Bay or Zephyr Heights for another pair of boots, or something. I also had a boonie hat, which was nice. Since I didn't have a rank pin or anything, I left it unadorned.

Tactical vest, too. Pony pattern, and one of Alphabittle's extras, since his torso and mine were around the same size. It was a bit tight, but I'd slim down eventually.

Breakfast was at Izzy's, and she made a small feast, including eggs for me.

Izzy: "I know how to FRY them, but not anything else." She shrugged a bit.

K: "It's fine." I nodded. "These are good." I forked in some hash browns.

Sunny: "This is very nice, Izzy." She smiled, looking down at her breakfast.

Hitch was tossing food down his gullet as fast as he could chew.

Sunny: "Maybe you can move to Maretime Bay." She stated, with an upturn at the end, like a question, but not quite.

Izzy: "OH!? I'd LOVE to!" She hopped a bit. "I mean, I reeallyy only know you, and Hitch and K, but I'm sure I can make LOOOTS of new friends! AND! OH! I can make sooo much more stuff with all the things they have around there, I'M SURE!" She was very excited.

Sunny: "Really?!" She looked up at her, not expecting that answer.

Izzy: "SURE!" She smiled back.

K: "Well, I for sure want you to be close to me, if you're going to be part of my new C-A-G." I nodded to her.

Izzy: "Oh, yeah!" She beamed a wide grin. "I can't wait to see what I can unicycle.." She leaned in, looking right into my eyes. "..with yoooooooooou as the inspiraaaation!"

I just smiled.

We got going around 9:30. Alphabittle provided a vehicle, and a driver for us. As promised, he'd take us with to Cupcake Falls.

Jasper himself was driving the jeep. It was a.. like a mutant Hummvee or JLTV sort of thing. An interesting design, it still used internal combustion. It worked, and worked well enough. The vehicle was showing its age, though, and clearly, they didn't get enough of these, either.

The trip to Cupcake Falls would be a couple hours.

K: "Gotta ask, Jasper." I nodded to him. "Are you excited?"

Jasper: "..I'll.. you always want honesty, right, General?" He looked over at me.

K: "Always." I nodded.

Jasper: "I'm not. I mean, I don't know what this is going to be or what you coming back means." He shrugged. "I've been let down a lot, you know.." He trailed off.

K: "All I can promise is that I'll do my best." I nodded. "I managed to rally all of ponykind to beat Tirek a thousand years ago. Whatever THIS is? We can do it again."

Jasper: "..I hope so.." He trailed off a bit. "Like, my.." He stopped, but Sunny leaned forwards and put her Mitt-ed hoof on his shoulder. "..my Ma, you know? She.. she had.. hope.. something might happen." He shrugged a bit, uncomfortably.

Sunny: "Then think about that." She reassured him. "Grandpa managed to get us out of trouble once, he can do it again." She smiled.

Interesting.

K: "Everything I can, Jasper. Even if it kills me." I stated.

He clammed up after that, especially once Izzy opened up about all kinds of Unicorn stuff. Mostly things she'd made, or things she was inspired to do, but couldn't at the moment. Hitch and Sunny spent the rest of the trip listening to her, but I could see the two of them sitting close to each other.. and the comfortableness they shared.

LOCATION: Cupcake Falls, Erie, New Equestria


Cupcake Falls was a small outpost, trading post, and had a few homes here. As we disembarked the vehicle, Jasper met up with the local Army team that was here, to get fuel. He'd packed several empty gas cans, and I noted that this outpost had a large fuel container for gas, and another for propane. They were well equipped.

The trading post had a cafe, and we decided to eat here. The fare was standard - oats, hay, vegetables, cheese, and some meat, since they were on the border of the North-East Command, where the population was majority Earth Pony.

Chef Atouie: "Well!" He came trotting out. "Are you.. General K?" He looked at me, with his head tilted.

K: "I am." I nodded. "And you are?"

Chef Atouie: "Chef Atouie." He nodded, and pointed to a painting above the cafe bar - it was the Cakes. "Maybe you know my ancestors."

I immediately got the thousand yard stare, and I didn't realize the tears had started flowing again. I was fed a memory, of Mrs. Cake, soon after I first arrived over a thousand years ago, advising me on what apple-related treats to get AJ. Before we were even engaged.

Memories.

Sunny: "...GRANDPA!" She clapped her hooves together.

K: "Huh-what?" I looked around, and realized I was being stared at. "Ah, sorry.. yes.. Mrs. Cake was a very good friend." I shrugged.

Chef Atouie: "Ah." He nodded, and leaned in. "Tell me the truth.. did she.. ah.." He gestured with one hoof. "..was she really faithful to Gramps?"

I coughed, and lowered my head, and blushed a bit. I had ANOTHER memory of her, too.. she flirted, but I wouldn't violate her marriage. Besides, AJ didn't approve.

K: "..her first two children were not her husband's. Her next three were." I shrugged. "She.. ah.. also made a few passes at me." I cleared my throat.

Chef Atouie: "I knew it!" He leaned back towards the kitchen. "SIS! YOU OWE ME FIFTY BITS! I WAS RIGHT! GENERAL K HIMSELF IS HERE!"

And this would be the NEGATIVE side of being famous and ancient - I realized I would be fielding uncomfortable questions from the descendants of my friends. Oh, well.

After we ate, and before we got ready to leave, Sunny cornered me.

Sunny: "Are you okay, Grandpa?" She asked, concerned.

K: "Oh.. the.. flash back?" I shrugged. "Yeah, I'm alright. You have to realize, to me, they were alive ten years ago." I said, solemnly. "Now, I'm here in this time, and they're all gone." Reduced to atoms, really. "I miss them, I always will." I hugged her. "But, I have you guys, now." I looked at Izzy's charm bracelet. "And that means everything to me."

Sunny: "Okay. As long as you never give up." She hugged me back, tightly.

Leader indeed.

Part 4: To the Pit

TIME: 15:37 NERST
DATE: Redemption Day 5/11 Septimus, 2054 C.S.
LOCATION: Cedar Mountain Pass, Maresechusetts/Erie Border, New Equestria


As we got to the pass in the mountains, we started to look for a place to stop for the night. The territory was rather barren, though, and I remember it used to be very green. Interesting.

As we kept walking, though... I felt something wrong. Very wrong.

K: "Hold up." I held up a fist.

Everyone stopped. I moved to a defensive stance, and had my Manticore out. Hitch and Sunny copied me and moved closer, forming a tight perimeter. Izzy took position as a floater.

Hitch: "You hear something, K?" He looked over to me for an instant.

K: "I feel.. something." I blinked.

At the very edge of my hearing, I detected the sound of wings. Large wings. I pivoted, and despite my tiredness, ran towards it. Between two small plateaus.. and Hitch was right at my heels. I moved between them, and some other tall rocks, looking for the source of the noise.

But, nothing.

Hitch: "I heard it, too." He said, in low tones.

Sunny: "Grandpa.." She said, quietly. "..what is it?"

K: "Something. I know I heard something." I shook my head.

I was getting my combat instincts back. And I liked it. I gave a small smirk. Something was here, but it knew that we knew. If it wasn't eager for a fight, that would be enough to ward it off.

After a bit, though, we relaxed.. and we paced away from that area, and doubled back on to our path. It was very strange. We knew it. Whatever it was, had tracked us, slipped up, been detected, then vanished.

Izzy: "I think someone was there!" She said, shrugging. "But, I'm not sure."

Sunny: "I felt it, too." She nodded.

K: "Well, let's get moving." I gestured, motioning.

After another two hours, we found a nice cave to rest in. Izzy went in first, not that she wanted to be pointpony, but more that she saw something glittering in there, and went to fetch it. She came back out with a small rock with iron pyrite flecked in it. Smiling, she set it to one side, as the rest of us gathered firewood for the night.

Dinner was beans, hardtack, and dried vegetables rehydrated in the bean sauce. It was a stew-like thing, especially with the hardtack chunks in it. VERY tasty, along with electrolyte powder drinks. I'd drawn pineapple.

Sunny sat close to me as we ate, while Hitch asked Izzy about how the MP's did things in Bridlewood.

Sunny: "You miss them a lot." She nodded. "But, you're okay with it."

K: "I do. But that whole little thing?" I nodded towards the direction we'd come. "Feeling like I was with experts again? Yeah, I.. I felt okay. You guys know what to do and how to do it." I patted her shoulder. "Just in case, shifts. I'll take first watch." I looked at them, then to Sunny. "No arguments."

Sunny: "Yes, Grandpa." She smiled.

Hitch: "I'll take second." He smiled.

Izzy: "I'll go next!" She cheered, throwing up her forelimbs to the sky. "I think I can do something with Mister Rock when I do."

Sunny: "Last watch is me, then." She nodded. "I'll make sure breakfast is ready."

I sat up for my shift. I kept watch on the darkness, eyeballing everything. I had a strong feeling that whatever had shadowed us before, might still be around.

When it came time for me to rest, I slid next to Sunny and Izzy, and they just draped themselves over me, in their sleep. I saw Hitch getting settled into position, and I waved to him to come over.

Hitch: "Yeah, K?" He leaned in, talking in law tones.

K: "I think our guest is watching us. Also, when are you going to tell her?" I nodded to Sunny.

Hitch: "Eh-!" He blushed. "T-Tell her what?!"

K: "That you have a crush on her." I smirked. "I think she likes you back. In that way." I smiled. "Come on, my colt, I was married a long time." I shrugged a tiny bit. "You need to make the first move." I nodded to him.

Hitch: "I-I'll take it under advisement.. K." He blushed again and slid off.

I smirked as I pulled the two mares close. He was cute. I approved, if he wanted to date my little girl. He was smart, brave, and well trained, too. He'd do well in whatever fight was to come. More than that, he could protect Sunny when and if she needed it.

Sunny.. I had such a good grand daughter. She was tough, smart, and she tried her best to lead. She was everything I'd hoped one of my children would turn out to be.

Izzy was so energetic, inventive, and certainly carefree and happy. She had a mind that never stopped. I admired that. She also seemed to have a tiny bit of the ol' Chaos in her, but I wasn't sure to what extent, other than it was FAR weaker than Pinkie's ever was. Or Toola's.

I was building a good team.


TIME: 11:14 NERST
LOCATION: Ruins of Great Mareington, Maresechusetts, New Equestria


Another ruined town. I paced in, and realized, this place had been lost since it all happened. The Ley Line Barrier was less than five miles from here, and we could see it. This town had been so close, that the eruption of the Ley Line had caused geological upheaval. The town wasn't just abandoned, it was shook to pieces.

There was a lot of buildings that were just fragments. Bits and pieces.

As we passed through, I felt that feeling again. This time, however, I had a plan. I nodded to the side, and Hitch took off casually.

After a short time, I heard a whistle, and I motioned. The team broke and charged through the ruins, all coming to a stop at almost the same spot.

Nothing.

Hitch: "I was SURE we had 'em." He kicked a rock.

I looked at the rock, and where it went. Finally coming to a rest, and when it did, I caught sight of something. I walked over and picked it up. It was a plastic ID card.

I casually showed this to the others without a word, and smirked. Captain Zephyrina Storm, eh? Interesting. I pocketed it, and motioned for us to keep going.

After another hour, we stopped at the northern edge of town. I made sure to pick a somewhat concealed spot. We started a fire, but I intentionally misdirected this Captain Storm.. we weren't there.

We waited in the shadows, and finally.. I saw her glide down form a high perch, and watch us from a distance. Or, rather, our camp. Me? I slid up behind her, and as soon as I got close, I poked the barrel of the Manticore to the back of her head.

K: "Safety Kill." Was all I said.

She didn't look at me, she just put her forelegs up. Slowly. Like she expected me to actually shoot her. I stepped back a bit, as Hitch, Izzy, and Sunny came up behind me.

Sunny: "You've been following us since the mountains!" She declared.

Captain Zephyrina Storm: "Very good, Lieutenant." She flicked an eye back. "Sheriff Hitch."

Hitch: "Captain." He shrugged. "What ARE you doing here? This isn't part of the Air Force's command area."

Captain Zephyrina Storm: "I heard a rumor that.. something.. came to Bridlewood." She shrugged a tiny bit, and flicked an eye back again, the other way.

Ohh... you bitch. No, you do not. JUST as she was about to move, I shoved her face-first into the ground, her wings had popped out the instant before, like she was going to take flight.

K: "Oh, no you don't." I stated. "I've been buffalo'd like that before." I shook my head. "Valiant effort - if I wasn't so experienced-"

Captain Zephyrina Storm: "Then.." She slowly rolled over (and tucked her wings). "..you really ARE him." She looked me over. "Gosh, the stories.. you're HUMAN after all!"

K: "I am." I slid my weapon away from her, slinging it behind me and offering her my hand.

Sunny: "What did you think you were going to do, anyway? We're on flat ground. It's not like Pegasi can FLY, you know." She snorted.

Captain Zephyrina Storm: "Oh, no?" She said, as I pulled her to her feet. "Y.. yeah.. that's-that's right. We can't." She said that unconvincingly.

K: "Captain." I nodded to her. "State your business. If not to my recognized authority, then to Sheriff Hitch's superior rank."

Captain Zephyrina Storm: "When I heard that some strange creature had come to Bridlewood, I had to check it out." She shrugged. "It took me a lot of looking, but I finally picked up your trail solidly, around Cupcake Falls." She smiled. "You do a good job of covering your bivouacs."

She was, I should note, dressed in a tiger stripe camo combat uniform. The tiger stripes had blue hints in them, with lighter flecks. It really looked like an Air Force spec ops's uniform. She had no rifle, though, but her pistol was customized.

Sunny: "I see." She nodded. "I'm Lieutenant Sunny Starscout. This is Hitch, and Izzy Moonbow." She shrugged. "And General K - my great grandfather."

K: "It's true." I nodded.

Captain Zephyrina Storm: "Ahah." She shrugged her wings a bit. "Sorry, I.. I've never known much about you, General K." She gestured. "Other than know you were supposedly human.. but not what that could be." She looked me up and down. "I'm glad to see this human thing isn't some tiny little shrew or something." She shrugged. "You're not bad, either."

K: "I used to be a lot better. If this was ten years ago for me, you never would've gotten that close." I patted her shoulder. "We're headed towards Zephyr Heights."

Captain Zephyrina Storm: "Oh." She looked down, then up. "Are you seeking an audience with the Prime Minister?" She tilted her head to me.

K: "Hopefully. And my daughter, Princess Theia, if she's there." I shrugged.

Captain Zephyrina Storm: "Mind if I tag along? I have to get back there, anyway - my commander is going to be pretty upset that I left without notice. Again." She chuckled a bit.

K: "General Order 15, Captain." I nodded.

Captain Zephyrina Storm: "Y-You'd-" She was shocked. "-after I..?" She looked down. "Thank you.. General."

I stuck my hand out to her.

K: "Just K. I need someone like you in CAG. You seem to be a good and determined investigator." I shrugged.

Zipp: "..alright, then, call me Zipp." She shook hoof-and-hand with me. "And, I'm sorry, Sheriff, and Tech.." She nodded to Izzy. "..for stepping out of bounds."

Izzy: "No problem!" She dove in and hugged her.

Zipp: "OH!" She fell backwards, not expecting a hug.

K: "Welcome to the team, Zipp." I smiled. "Come on, let's get some lunch." I gestured.

When we got close, she saw that we had piled up some rocks to look like us sitting around the fire, and we'd made an effort to conceal our (fake) selves.

Zipp: "Hey, not bad!" She looked at each one of them.

Izzy: "I made those!" She cheered.

Lunch was ration oats and dried fruits, with tea, and vitamin enriched crackers. Simple, but filling. Zipp handed out a pack of peanut butter sandwich crackers.

As I took one, I got a vision of Trixie Seeker. For an instant. I sniffled a bit.

Sunny: "You okay, Grandpa?" She nodded to me.

K: "Yeah. Just remembering another old friend." I shrugged.

Zipp: "You must have a lot of them.. I mean.. you raised an army, right?" She shrugged.

K: "I do, and did." I shrugged back. "They're gone, now. I have you all to help me, now. And help figure out how to fix everything that's gone wrong." I nodded.

Zipp: "You're dedicated." She smiled. "I like that!"

K: "Everything, anything I can do." I gestured to her. "Even if it costs me everything."

Zipp: "I know so little about you.." She trailed off. "..I didn't think the legends were really real.. I'm sorry."

K: "It's fine, Zipp." I patted her shoulder.

SO, I spent the lunch time talking about me. My experiences as a human. My time on Earth. My life. My dead wife, and my dead family. I spoke of it dismissively, flatly, as detached as I could be. It hurt, but I didn't want to let on how much it hurt.

Not that it mattered. They all picked up on it.

Zipp: "..you've been through a lot." She sighed. "And you'd still throw everything on the line.. for us?" She tilted her head.

K: "You are all pure and sweet and wonderful. This world is sweet and wonderful. It is pure, or as pure as you can get. It deserves to live in peace. And no matter what it costs me, I will absolutely do whatever I can to save you all." I nodded to her. "Because I care."

Sunny: "We're family." She smiled.

Izzy: "We're FRIENDS!" She cheered.

Hitch: "Because we believe we can make the world better." He smiled.

Zipp: "Well, if I had any doubts before, I don't any more." He shrugged. "Come on. I'll take you to see the Prime Minister." She smiled.

So, now, I had a detective, an engineer, my grand daughter, and a sheriff with me. What was next? I didn't know for sure, but I did know this world was rediscovering the one thing I always used to say.

Friendship is Magic.
