Part 1: Radio Active

I never saw what happened out in those woods. Zecora sort-of did, given that one of her Totems had a potion of far sight on it, so she could watch her cabin while she was away. So, what follows isn't an eyewitness account of something I did, but a retelling of a witness statement, in a sense.

Royal Army Quartermaster Sergeant Radiant Stratus. Brave, intelligent, bold - formerly of the 2nd Company, 1st Regiment, Equestrian Royal Army, and with command of 2nd Platoon, Radiant Stratus became an abandoned identity - something like what happened to Bruce Wayne when he became Batman. Batman was the person, Bruce Wayne was the disguise.

She had been in command of the Squad sent to Zecora's to protect her from any threats that might endanger Katrina.

She also became, quite by accident.. very changed indeed.

This is what Zecora told me what happened after I retreated, carrying Katrina...


TIME: 18:16 ERST
DATE: War Day 140
LOCATION: Zecora's Cabin

As General K retreated through the root cellar, out of Zecora's cabin, inside, the battle only grew more intense. Both Zecora and her brother were out for blood - they wanted to kill each other, each for their own reasons. Zecora heard General K call to her, and this gave her a small grin - the irony that a virtual outcast such as herself was befriended by another.

She dove under Zorin's next swipe, rolling and coming up behind him, cracking him in the back of the head with the base of her Assegai. It was a jab, not a slolid hit, but it was enough to put him off balance. He stumbled forwards, and collided with a pile of masks. Grabbing them one at a time in rapid succession, he hurled them across the room at Zecora - who dodged and rolled away from each one in turn - chasing her around the room with them.

Zecora: "Your aim is weak, your throws are frail - tell me brother, how did you become such FAIL!?"

Zorin: "Insult me further - you won't have time, when my axe is buried in your SPINE, no longer will I hear such a line!" He charged at her.

She picked and rolled off to the side, taking cover behind another mask, which she picked up and used as an improvised shield, as she charged across the room. Colliding with Zorin, she crashed him into her main mixing table, sending a cloud of potion materials everywhere - this turned the white haze of her Smoke Potion into a colorful fog of greens and dark grays..

Zecora: "Crush you I must, if my life is precious - death for you, and your hatred infectious!" She tried to smash him again with the shield..

..only to have Zorin hoof-punch the mask, and shatter it completely. Then take a swipe at her with his axe, which Zecora barely had time to block. Their weapons locked up, and hooked together. Zorin was on top, pushing againt Zecora, before lashing out with his rear-left hoof and snapping it down over her shin. There's an audible snap, and Zecora falls backwards, now on the ground, with Zorin on top of her.

Zorin: "You are the weak one, sister dear.. your death will be swift, do not fear.. screams of your agony, your friends shall not hear!"

He yanked hard, snapping her Assegai away from her grasp. In the same move, she tried to block, but a hard slam with the shaft of the axe solicited another snapping sound from her right foreleg, across the lower length, just above the fetlock. Zorin, sensing victory, put his right rear hoof in her gut, pinning her in place, and raised the axe over his head..

Zecora: "Finish me, gutless one, if my time is truly done!" She lay there, legs splayed open..

QMS Radiant Stratus: "GET YOUR FILTHY HOOVES OFF HER, YOU DAMNED DIRTY ZEBRA!"

From the side, a small shockwave came from the door as Quartermaster Sergeant Radiant Stratus fired herself off the ground in a short burst of near-sonic speed, covering ten feet in under a second. She tackled Zorin off the helpless Zecora, and slammed him into the wall, knocking a locked cabinet containing some of Zecora's spell components, to the ground.

Zorin: "INTERLOPING PONY, SINCE YOU SO INSIST, YOUR DEATH WILL NOT BE SWIFT! GUT YOU, I SHALL, AND YOUR SOUL, DISMISSED!"

He de-corked a vial and whipped it across her face. This reacted with the smoke, and produced a momentary flame. Radiant fell backwards, with a scream.

Radiant: "YOU BUCKING TOAD!" She screamed, lifting herself off the floor. Her snout was burned, to the point that seared flesh was exposed. "BUCK YOU! I'M GONNA BUCK YOU UP!" She drew her Sherman Bayonet from her hip, and lunged at him.

Zorin deftly dodged her, like a prize fighter versus a rookie.

Zecora: "USE CARE, LITTE PONY, FOR HIS FIGHTING SKILL IS GREAT! DO NOT LET HIS AXE BE YOUR FATE!"

She cautioned, trying to pull herself away from the center of the room, over towards another cabinet - one with a skull-and-crossbones marking on it.

Zorin: "THE TRUTH, FOR ONCE, MY SISTER TELLS! MY BLOODIED AXE, OVER A HUNDRED LIVES IT DISPELLS! AND IT SHALL SEND YOU TO ALL NINE HELLS!" He yelled, kicking the overturned cabinet up, and hoof-punching it right into Radiant's chest.

His axe smashed into it, just as Radiant reeled back, sending broken glass, splintered wood and spell components everywhere. When Radiant landed, she was peppered with glass shards, stains on her coat and uniform from different spell components, and a couple of pieces of splintered wood. She rolled to the side, holding her Sherman Bayonet before her, switching from offensive to defesive stances.

Radiant: "Yeah? Well BUCK you AND your nine hells! I'm gonna SHANK you!" She said, feinting forwards, then pulling way back as he swung, using her wings to flap out of the way, and gain a little altitude.

Zorin: "SPEAK NO MORE, THERE'S HELL'S DOOR! LET US SEE THE BLOOD OF YOUR CORE!" He screamed out, kicking hard enough off the floor that he kicked a chunk out of it.

He speared into Radiant, axe finding its mark in her right shoulder - but her Sherman Bayonet finding IT'S mark in his GROIN, and HOOKING him, as they fell, together, right into the cabinet, that Zecora was trying to mix something from. The cabinet exploded as their bodies hit it, sending all her ingredients everywhere - the room's smoke took on a sickly yellow hue. Zecora was flung to the side - Zorin was screaming.

Zorin: "MY MANPARTS DEFACED! FOR THAT DISGRACE, MY AXE WILL MEET YOUR BRAINCASE!"

Zecora just didn't have enough time to stop him. The axe came down and embedded itself in Radiant's neck, her raised arm barely able to deflect it. Blood oozed everywhere.. but Zecora landed right by her Assegai. And once she found it, she grasped it in her left fetlock, and -

Zecora: "CATCH!" - Threw it, impaling him in the gut with the sharp spear. She threw it with enough force that it embedded in the wall, pinning him to it.

Zecora: *North Jersey Accent* "You piece'a spit.." She hauled herself up, staggering over towards Zorin, pulling his axe from Radiant's neck. "BUCK. YOU!" She swung the axe with her good arm, whipping it around and slicing straight through the muscle, sinew, and bone.. decapitating him. "Radiant..?" She asked, staggering that half-step back to look at her.

But her eyes.. she was gone.

..or so it seemed.

Twilight: "ZECORA!" She burst into the room, pulling her Zhukov magazine out with her teeth, and fumbling for her next one from her large magazine pouch on her chest. "We have to GO! NOW!" She said, looking at Radiant, as Corporal Dawn Earlylight stepped into the room, covering the door with her Sherman.

Dawn: "Oh, Sweet Celestia..! Sergeant! NO!" She was ready to cry.

Zecora: "Now is not the time to cry.." She said, throwing Zorin's head into her boiling pot, off in the corner of the room. "..now is the time to fly." She staggered over to one of her few unbroken cabinets, and pulled out a box, wrapping her wounds quickly with a salve and bandages.

Applejack: "HONEYBUN!?" She charged in, seeing Dawn and the look on her face (she later told me, she felt guilty that she was relieved it was Radiant that was dead, and not me) - but sighed, seeing it was Radiant on the floor, not me. "Twi, we gotta go. We gotta find K.." She implored.

Zecora: "A moment's time, I require.." She said, pulling her Assgai from Zorin's corpse, and using it as a crutch. "..I won't have time to even extinguish my fire." She muttered that last doublet part out, as she led the girls away from her cabin.




But this wasn't the last chapter in Radiant Stratus' life. No.. it was.. but it wasn't the last chapter in the life of the body that lay there on Zecora's floor. All of those potion components, the smoke, the fires.. it became a massive toxic cloud, that filled the room. These toxins - not even Zecora was able to identify everything that ended up in the mixture.

But whatever it was, it took this apparently 'dead' pony, and forced the spark of life back into her body. But, in the meantime, it changed her. Changed the way her mind worked. It also changed her body. As her heartbeat resumed, a very unique thing happened - her Cutie Mark changed. This is unheard-of among Ponies. But, if she really WAS dead, even for a few minutes, perhaps that explains it. Her Cutie Mark used to be a little radio - she loved music, Vy being one of her favorite artists - but as her muscles began to find the energy to move again, the Mark changed.

To three black triangles, pointing downwards, in a field of yellow.

On Earth, this is the symbol for radioactive fallout. The three triangles representing "death."

The little radio arial remained, though, oddly affixed to the circle.

When she stirred from her position, she apparently found her Sherman Bayonet. Picking it up, she had looked at it, according to what Zecora said, that she saw through the Mask that was looking into the room. One might guess that she looked at her own reflection. Then at her flank.

And it seemed to come naturally to her. She said:

"I'm not.. Radiant Stratus any more. I am now.. Radio Active."

She picked herself up out of the rubble, and in a frustrated grunt, she was able to send a cascading energy cloud across the floor, sweeping away rubble like it was nothing.

But she had no horn.

Nor, any longer, did she have wings.

She seemed to realise this, as she looked at the ground, seeing her pegasus feathers all over the floor.

She was different. She was.. a freak.

But, she was still wearing Equestria's uniform.. which was the next thing she looked at. She seemed filled with a terrible resolve.. looking at the door to Zecora's cabin, the last thing we knew was that she marched right towards it, Sherman Bayonet still clenched in one fetlock..

[End of Part 1]

Part 2: God from Machine (Deus Ex Machina)

TIME: 08:45 ERST
DATE: War Day 141
LOCATION: Ponyville

Artillery came raining down on the edge of Ponyville in a terrible storm of fire and explosions. Baltimare's battery scored hit after hit, blowing chunks of buildings apart, and decimating some of the larger creatures in one hit. I stood and watched, as Dawn Earlylight paced up to me, with her Sherman on her shoulder.

Dawn: "Corporal Dawn Earlylight, reporting for duty." She said, as a shell whistled overhead.

K: "Excellent. You're with me." I shrugged. "My entire staff is wounded. You're it." I said, calmly.

Dawn: "I.." She started, as the last of the rounds came overhead, and flattened Rose's cafe for the second time.

K: "Stow it." I grabbed my flare gun, loading a green flare shell. "PREPARE TO CHARGE!" I fired it into the air, loosing hell's fury. "CHAAAAARGE!" I screamed, pointing at the town.

We advanced towards the town in a great rush. Everyone started shooting as soon as they got off the hills - there was no grand strategy here, nor can there be in a situation like this. You have to trust your individual unit commanders to know to sweep and clear everything they pass over. It's how it goes - sure, you can micromanage and assign specific buildings to specific squads, but it's far simpler to simply advance as a wave, and have the subordinate officers and NCO's dictate who takes a building as the situation develops, and hope they remember to mark everything.

As we moved into town, we slowed, to allow the Ponyville Militia to cease fire in our direction (to prevent blue-on-blue casualties), and shift fire to their flanks. I watched as three squads from Detrot tackled a Treant and lit it on fire with thier flare guns. The burning, screaming tree monster ran for it for about twenty meters, before someone with a Knox blew it apart.

A squad each from the Detrot Cavalry and the Baltimare Infantry swept through a house - it was Lyra's of all things - and I had to catch one of them as a monsterous undead wolf-thing threw one of them through the window. A brief thanks, and she returned to the fight. Through the chaos of this pitched, open urban war, I managed to get myself and Dawn through the "front line" area, and to the main square of Ponyville. I was looking to link up with the Rangers..

K: "LYRA! CHEERILEE!? TAVII!? ANYONE HERE!?" I yelled, as the din of the battle wasn't more than a few feet behind me.

Mac: "OVER HERE!" He called, sticking his head out of a window.

I looked at Dawn as if to say 'Well, let's freakin' do it!' - ran for the window, dove over the window sill, and rolled into the room. She cleared it like an expert, sliding to a stop. Mac was in here with Lyra and Vy. Vy's right foreleg was bleeding up by her shoulder, her uniform sleeve used as a makeshift bandage.

K: "Report, Mac." I said, sliding up by the sill, and peeking over the edge.

Mac: "Wounded all over - Sunshine's hurt, most of his squad is down, we're all mixed up, and I don't have a radio. When they broke our lines, they really broke them - the Treants that attacked came in one huge wave. Without artillery or enough grenade launchers, we had no way to stop them. Air support was only somewhat effective. No napalm." He shrugged. "So, we broke and ran. I know, I know, bad form. But it was either a rout, or get decimated. Cheerilee and Derpy rallied us in the square, had us taking cover -"

K: "Don't you fuckin' tell me that pregnant bitch is running around here, taking fire!?"

Mac: *Blink* "That pregnant bitch is running around here, taking fire."

K: *Exasperated sigh* "I ASKED you not to TELL me that!" Bonus points to anyone who knows what I just did here. "Continue."

Mac: "I got no word on casualties other than 4th Squad being down, but I saw Cloud Kicker an hour ago - brought us some ammo." Another shrug. "We gone through fifty belts on the damn Pershing, and I don't wanna think about how many mags gone through our Shermans and Zhukovs.."

K: *Groan* "I don't even want to consider the armory work and the maintenance in store for us after this - fuck it, we'll just ship the small arms off to Canterlot and have the Equestrian Army pick through them, fuck trying to do it ourselves here. I'll just requisition a new batch of weapons for the city." I made frustrated hand gestures. "Anyone spotted The Big Boss?" I asked, meaning Grogar.

Mac: "Mm, nope." He pawed the ground. "Someone saw a freaked-up donkey, though - and not one we ever seen before-"

K: "Bray. His name is Bray. He's Grogar's butt buddy." *Snort* "Oh, and Katrina is worthless for intel - I deviated for nothing, and the Royal Army squad that was protecting her and Zecora were wiped - all except Corporal Earlylight here."

Mac: "Where's muh sister?" He asked, peeking out the window.

K: "She's fine - banged up, but fine. She's back at Militia HQ, getting patched up." *Sigh* "Marines and other RF's are coming through from Sweet Apple Acres - they should be here in a minute or two. Rally the Rangers and everyone else in town, have them stand down and fall back. We've got RF's from all over the place coming in to finish this - stand down everyone that was here when this all started, get to the clinic, get everyone patched up and tended to, then withdraw to The Farm." By that, I meant Militia HQ. "Get food, get rest, if there's still some fight to be had after that, we'll see about it." I shrugged. "Get going."

Mac: "Right." He helped Lyra up off the ground - she looked exhausted..

K: "Oh, Lyra, your boyfriend's come to rescue you." I smirked.

Lyra: *Mm* "Love that stallion.." She gave a weak smirk to me. "..me knight in shinin' armour.."

K: "Hey, don't go flirting over Twi's brother!" *Chortle* "Cadence'll be pissed."

Vinyl Scratch: *Giggle* "Horrible!"

K: "Yeah, yeah, get going." I shoo'ed them out the back door, as Spirit and his First Squad entered, passing them. "Ah, perfect timing. Set up a Pershing on the roof, along with a dedicated sniper - I'd like to get some overwatch on the battle from here."

Spirit: "Of course, General." He made the arrangements. "Ponyville Militia's pulling back?"

K: "Yes. They're pushed to the breaking point. Hopefully, with the fresh troops, we can end this - most've 'em are veterans as it is, this isn't their first dance." I shrugged. "Status report?" I asked, as Dawn took up Mac's former position at the Pershing on the first floor window.

Spirit: "The advance is slowed to a crawl - it's not clearing the buildings that's doing it, like your training warned us, it's actually killing the monsters. Some of them take two or three magazines to kill - it's not like fighting Raptorians." He one-hoof shrugged as he lent a hand setting up the radio.

K: "Well, air support is out of the question until we can get them out in the open. But call back to HQ, tell Scarlet to call up any A-F squadrons in the area. I'm sure the Wonderbolts and the Cloudriders are completely exhausted by now. And I want more bomb trucks brought in - with napalm. Every napalm bomb we can get our hands on. We'll need it. The Treants don't like fire, and they're damned hard to kill any other way, as I've seen."

Spirit: "Yes, General." He called in and made those arrangements, too.

K: "What we really, really need is magic.. like, lots of it. Something that can counter-act necromancy. Unfortunately, that kind of magic isn't taught any more - only Celestia and Luna know it, and only one of them is effective at any one time." I grumbled. "If Zecora wasn't so banged up, and her cabin wrecked, I'd ask her if there was anything she could do."

I was really running out of options. What was it I always said? Science will fuck you? Well, right now, Science was fucked by Magic, no two ways about it.

Oh, sure, with enough time and effort, we could win, I was sure of that - we had all the tools, and we had enough forces to get the job done, but the needless suffering because of a lack of an easier way to do things-

*TITANIC EXPLOSION*

-what the fuck was that?!

K: "WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT!?" Sweet JESUS this world is rude, I can't even have an internal monologue these days without getting interrupted!

Spirit: "No idea - " He held up a hoof. "This is Bravo Mike Leader Actual for Alpha Leader, I quote: 'What the BUCK was that?' Any callsigns with any intel, come back! Over." Bravo Mike - Bellerophon Marines, if you were wondering about that.

Dex: C> "This is Foxtrot Romeo Leader Actual - I got eyes on it, Dude, but you're NEVER going to believe it! Over."

I grabbed the mic from Spirit.

K: C> "This is Alpha Leader Actual - Try me, Foxtrot Romeo. Status report. Over."

Dex: C> "Uh.. we got.. some kinda.. it's a pony in a Royal Army uniform.. she's floating.. uh.. infantry shoulderboards.. Q-M-S rank.. *fzt* coat, black mane, looks like a purple stripe in it.. *fzzt* can't see her.. ah! Cutie Mark is.. *fzzzt* I've never seen anything like this before, dude.. this is like, majorly rad and freaky.. it looks like a yellow circle with.. *fzrrrzt* ...black triangles in it. With some kinda antennae sticking out of *fazzrrrzzrt* She's, like, glowing, an-" *Static*

K: C> "Foxtrot Romeo, come in, you're breaking up. Over." I said, calmly, at first. "FOXTROT ROMEO, COME IN! OVER!" Nothing. "Alpha Leader Actual to any unit near Foxtrot Romeo's location, I need eyes on Foxtrot Romeo and the mystery pony! Any unit, come in! Over!" Still, nothing but static. "Buck this, I'm going out there. Stay here, Captain." I said, grabbing someone's Zhukov and magazine pouch before darting out the door.

Dawn was right behind me - good soldier, that one.

Dawn: "General.. that description.. it.. it's impossible-"

K: "Impossible is the order of the day, Corporal, spill it." I said, trying to figure out Dex's original path of advance.

Dawn: "It.. sounds like.. Radiant, sir. Radiant Stratus. My.. my sergeant, sir." She said, her voice breaking from her mind trying to acknowledge the concept. "I don't.. she's DEAD, sir. Zorin killed her!" She shook her head.

K: "Well, it seems she got better." I shrugged, as I made my way towards the biggest ruckus I could hear, figuring that must be the source of all this.

I was right.

Standing in the middle of the north square was a floating pony. Her uniform in tatters, her eyes glowing green.. hell, her whole body had a green aura around it! She was even levitating off the ground. I could actually see the wounds on her back where her wings used to be, like swollen ulcers. Her ability to fly was curtailed, but she seemed to have replaced it with some kind of.. magic power. I couldn't figure it out, at the time, since I wasn't actually there to see her die, nor knew what had gone on in the cabin with Zecora...

..a Treant came from around one of the buildings, and almost without a thought, she stared at it, and a magical burst of energy came from her hooves, hit the Treant, and it fell to the ground. Not destroyed - DE-ANIMATED. She had BANISHED whatever magic was used to animate the creature in the first place!

I couldn't believe what I'd just seen. No, no, I believed it, I was just having a hard time comprehending it.

Dawn: "SERGEANT..!" She shook her head. "RADIANT! IT'S ME, DAWN! CAN YOU HEAR ME!?" She yelled at the.. at her former Sergeant.

But Radiant didn't seem to hear her. She floated from the north square along one of the side roads - it led past The Doctors' Social Club, where all the past Doctors came and played Bridge once a week and talked about me behind my back. Well.. I knew I had at least one man that defended me.. anyhow, all Radiant did was stare at the building, and her aura moved into it, like an extension of herself. Timberwolves came running out, in fear, their eyes glowing red.. and all of a sudden, with a wave of a hoof, their eyes went back to normal.

They looked at each other a second, then to me, then to Radiant.. then they took off running, a trail of pee following them as they yelped.

K: "Deus Ex Machina.." I drivled out, watching the display.

Dawn: "What, sir?"

K: "God from Machine.. it's an ancient Earth term. When, in plays, a God character would be lowered onto stage by a mechanical crane. It also symbolized.. well, that the God would bring a sudden and abrupt solution to the problem facing the main characters, usually. One of our greatest ancient writers once cautioned his fellow playwrights not to ever use Deus Ex Machina to get themselves or their characters out of a jam." I shrugged. "Or, at least, not use it every single time."

As I explained this all, I watched Radiant singlehandedly clear THE ENTIRE BLOCK of enemies. Then the next one.. and the next..

..deus ex machina, indeed. I was stunned into silence. I could only watch this grotesque display of power as Radiant singlehandedly won the entire first stage of the battle, and made the second stage of it - holding the line at our old defensive position - null and void. She wiped out the entire enemy force..

..then floated off into the field near Fluttershy's cabin, and headed straight for the forest. About halfway there, a large force of undead and other beasts simply surrounded her, as though they expected her to cower in fright. Instead, with one massive flash, and an explosion of green light and smoke that resembled a mushroom cloud, she "detonated" her aura, de-animating every single monster that had surrounded her.

Oh, then her aura dissepated, and she dropped to the ground like a meat sack, bleeding from all of her wounds.

K: "Well, so much for that. MEEEEEEEDDDDDIIIIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCC!!"


TIME: 10:55 ERST
DATE: War Day 141
LOCATION: Ponyville Clinic

We were in the ICU. Radiant had been brought in by ponies in haz-mat suits led by Golden's cousin, Blue Harvest, who had a fascination with all things germy and biological. She fancied herself a sort of farming scientist - always trying to figure out how best to beat a farmer's worst disease-based enemies at thier own game. And as a result, she'd fashioned a number of inventive devices to help herself out.

Haz-Mat suits being one of them.

Dr. Allcome, and even Dr. Well Wishes, were completely stumped about this - and this was the first time I was able to speak to Well Wishes without wanting to pound his snout into his skull. He was talking like a doctor, instead of a soap box political agitator.

Dr. Well Wishes: "I've never SEEN anything like this before! What is it - a magical contamination of some kind?"

Dr. Allcome: "I-I'm not sure. We're running tests on the fibers of her uniform, but they might not be back for hours."

K: "Well Wishes.. status report." I walked up.

He looked, for a moment, like he wanted to say something snarky, but he shook his head and got right to the point.

Dr. Well Wishes: "We have no idea. -I- have no idea, and I studied pharmacology as a minor in med school." He shrugged. "I mean, I can't even tell if her vital signs are stable - they're all over the board. Her temperature is four points higher than it should be, but her oxygen saturation levels are ten percent lower than normal. Her systolic blood pressure is through the roof, but her diastolic is in the basement - she should be DEAD with stats like this. Oh, and her heart rate is fifty beats-per-minute higher than it has any right to be!" He flapped his forelegs in frustration.

Dr. Allcome: "We're both stumped, K. We aren't even sure if she's hazardous to others at this point. But we do know that military radios are useless within fifty feet of her." He shrugged. "She's putting off some kind of radio wave interference."

K: "Alright, I get it, we're completely in the dark here." I shrugged.

Dr. Allcome: "Oh, not with her around. She glows in the dark, mildly. And we think.. well.. we're not sure about this one, but her Cutie Mark changed. That's.. never happened before.. to our knowledge. It.. can only happen if the pony in question.. well, dies."

K: "So.. she was physically dead at some point." I scratched the back of my head.

Dr. Well Wishes: "Looks like it. I mean, it's just a guess."

K: "Alright, keep me updated." I said, shrugging, and walking back out to the corridor. I passed Dawn as I headed for the General Ward. "You have permission to stay with her, if it'll make you feel better, Corporal."

Dawn: "Thank you, General." She nodded, tiredly.

As I headed to where the Girls were - Fluttershy had been moved into the General Ward area and to a room with the rest of them - I wondered what forces conspired to bring Radiant back from the dead? What brought about this? And.. was she still Radiant Stratus? I didn't know, yet. I wasn't sure. I had no answers, and it bothered me that I was completely in the dark about something so absolutely vital as this.

Part 2: Lazarus

TIME: 11:00 ESRT
DATE: War Day 141
LOCATION: Ponyville Clinic, General Ward

I simply walked into the room, as the girls were sleeping. Even Pinkamena wasn't awake, not that she was in a murderous mood right now. I went and sat next to Fluttershy's bed. She was curled up tightly under the blanket, and every now and then, she whimpered. Angel came out from underneath her bed, saw that it was me, put his "sword" away (Fluttershy's Sherman Bayonet, which he still had in a sheath behind his back), and returned to his hidden spot.

Fluttershy: *OH!* She awoke suddenly, and snapped over on her other side - I saw a wince of pain there - and saw me. "Oh... K..." She was trembling, looking at the mattress. She couldn't even bear to look me in the eye. "I.."

K: "Fluttershy, where I come from, you've endured probably the second most heinous crime in my society. I can't begin to.." I shrugged. "..no amount of cupcakes and cake is going to bury that pain-"

Fluttershy: "-it didn't before." She mumbled, barely audible.

K: "Before..?" I looked at her, squinting, trying to make sense of it.

Fluttershy: "I..." She looked over, seeing the others were asleep. "...there's a reason I don't have anything to do with my parents."

K: "Oh.." I felt sick. No, I felt like my skin turned green with disgust. "..I have.. no words."

Fluttershy: "It's why I stay to myself.. I don't.." Tears flowed freely from her eyes. "..I can't. I can't." She rest her head on her pillow. "I pretend it didn't happen and I.. I do what I'm supposed to.. and.. I just.."

K: "It's why you prefer the company of forest animals. They've never.." I shurgged. "..they'd never do that to you. Cause you that kind of pain."

Fluttershy: "I'm used to pain." She said, murmuring, barely audible enough to be heard. "Very used to pain." She looked at Rarity. "Not all of us had happy lives, you know. I don't think the cartoons you said we're in.. would cover that."

K: "Not in a million years. The subject is far too senstive, and people are simply too thin-skinned." I swallowed, hard, to keep from both crying and screaming.

Fluttershy: "It's why.. I guess.. we all became friends." She hugged her pillow as tightly as she could.

K: "So.." I nodded to the other girls. "..what burdens do they carry?"

Fluttershy: "I.." She turned her head away. "..Rarity's parents wanted her to be perfect in every way. She wasn't. They.. they yelled at her a lot, made her feel so stupid. It's why she takes care of Sweetie Belle. She doesn't want her to go through that." Her lips were quivering. I knew this would be painful for her. "Dash, you know.. the bullies. But I don't think.. they used to beat her up a lot, too. Stuff her in lockers.." She frowned.. hard. "Pinkie's parents are still poor. Very poor. I know her sisters moved away from the farm, but we never see them - Pinkie won't tell us where they are or what they do. She's.. I think she's the only one that's happy." She sighed in anguish. "And her parents.. she sends them money all the time, but.. I.. I don't think they really.." She looked at me. "Is it possible for a parent to not love their children?"

K: "Where I come from, yes. It's been known to happen. The parents place blame for things on the children, or, they just never develop a connection to them." I shrugged. "How do you all deal with this?!" I was stunned at these revealations.

Fluttershy: "I.. well.. I stay out of everyone's way.. I.. I don't want to.." She sniffled. "..I get scared when ponies I don't know, touch me. Even friendly hugs. The girls.. they're.. they were the first ones I was ever really comfortable around, like that." She stirred some. "Pinkie, I know, her parties are her way of.. you know.. making herself happy. Dash.."

K: "..overcompensates for her low feelings of self-worth. She strives to be the best, because she isn't confident that she really is as good as she boasts herself to be." I shook my head, shrugging. "I can see that one."

Fluttershy: "Right." She looked at Rarity. "And she's kinda.. Rarity's kinda the same way, but.. she'll push herself way too hard, she won't sieze up like Dash can. She'll push herself to death, I know she would.. and the worse the problem, the more she'll do to herself." She mewled a little.

K: "I know what AJ's problem is - Sweet Apple Acres operated on a very thin profit margin before I got there and started making efficiency upgrades, and basically getting them extra work as part of the military. She's constantly afraid something will happen and she'll lose the farm. Her parents are gone - and she feels horrible that Apple Bloom will never know them. It's part of the reason she wanted to be a High Society Pony like Clement and Cara - I mean, they're both good people and damned fine Cavalry Ponies, but they're not right for her, not unless she really forced herself to be like them. And she did it because she couldn't bear the thought that the farm would fail - she thought if she could establish herself in High Society, she could get Apple Bloom in there, too. She wasn't worried about Mac - he could always get labor work, anywhere, and he'd take care of Granny Smith if it came down to it." I shrugged. "I know my dear love's pain. She's not afraid of letting herself down, she's afraid of letting her family down - it's one of the reasons we connect so well. We'd both rather die than fail those closest to us. My wife.. J-- shares that quality."

I leaned back in the chair a little, and grabbed Angel from under the bed and set him next to Fluttershy.

K: "So, all of you carry a burden.. and I can only imagine what Twi's been going through. She dedicated her life to Princess Celestia.. blindly loyal, wanting to learn everything she could, to serve her Liege, in a way her brother couldn't - and that's another thing - I'm pretty sure she feels insecure about her brother's talents. Like.. she isn't good enough. Shining Armor could, if he dedicated himself to magic, be as skilled as her, and despite everyone telling her how powerful she is, she doesn't think she measures up. Then we learned what Celestia did in the past, and her world collapsed around her."

Fluttershy: "What about you?" She asked, inching slightly closer.

K: "Hah.. what about me? What burden do I have? Well.. I'm a failure in the human world - I've never been able to get a steady job. I had an education, but the job market collapsed for it right after I earned my diploma. I'll never measure up to what's expected of me. I can't provide for my wife independently of government assistance and we live with her family. In fact, it wasn't until I came here that I was able to succeed at something. And what am I so good at that I finally stop being a failure? The Art of War. Killing. Bringing pain. Causing death. How many lives have I brought to tragic ends? How many ponies are dead because of me?" I snorted a bit.

Fluttershy: "But.."

K: "..the war isn't my fault, I know, and without this great and terrible knowledge, you'd all be suffering much more. That doesn't help when I see Pina Colada around town.." I looked at the floor. "..every death, I've taken personally. And add to that the fact that I know J is still alive somewhere, and here I am, sleeping around on her - I've had five women so far, and I know it won't stop at that. In my world, having relations with another person while you're married or betrothed is wrong. And in my Faith, it's a horrible sin. In some places, it's even a crime that carries a prison sentence." I rest my head on my fist, my elbow on the arm rest. "But, I've come to accept that part - I know I'm going to hell, so, I no longer care if I cheat on J.. Applejack? Well, with her approval, I would sleep with another mare. She approves of Luna." I looked at Fluttershy. "And those are my burdens. And the burden of not knowing if I'm making the right decisions, the burden of command, knowing I have so many lives on the line for each choice I make.. I have a lot of burdens." I shrugged.

Fluttershy: "..." She looked at the mattress again - Angel was now curled up in her mane, protectively.

K: "It's a lot." I leaned forwards. "And here, I came to cheer you up. I'm sorry."

Fluttershy: "No, it's okay.. I.. I feel better, now that I talked about it a little." She looked up at me with a little blush.

K: "You don't open up to anyone, do you?" I asked, with a little frown on my face.

Fluttershy: "Not.. really.. no.." She pulled her forelegs in a bit, defensively.

K: "I can understand why." I nodded, my thumbs holding up my head. I stood up, though. "If you ever need to talk or anything.. you can always come to me, Fluttershy. You're my friend, I'll always make time to listen to you." I gave her a bit of a smile before I headed to the door. "Let the girls know I said to rest and recover. No pushing to get out of bed and do something foolish - that's my job." I gave her a bit of a smile before exiting.

Out in the hall, I caught up with Big Mac, who was seeing to the rest of the Rangers' status.

K: "What's up, Mac?" I said, sliding up next to him, and leaning on the desk he was at.

Mac: "I have casualty reports for you, General." He looked at me, with a bit of a wry chuckle. "We got off so easy on this one.. we only lost one pony."

K: "Five, total, then. Including Radiant's squad. I don't think the rest of them are going to pull a Lazarus act on us." I sighed. "Who was it?" I asked, waiting for the sting.

Mac: "Silver Script.." He said, grimly.

K: "Oh, God.. Written's.." I shook my head. "He knows?" I asked. "Damn, and this is why.." A sigh.

Mac: "No. I think he's in the central treatment ward, looking after the rest of the Ponyville Milita, though."

K: "I'll tell him. Make sure everyone gets rest, alright? And send Scarlet and Harv my way." I nodded and moved to the central treament ward.

Written was there, lookin after the wounded from Ponyville. Harv wasn't around. I just walked over, and pulled him aside. I looked right into his eyes as I did it, too.

K: "Written.. we only took one fatality in the battle." I started. A high note.

2LT Written Script: "Okay.. and?" He tilted his head.

K: "It was your brother." My face, I know, screwed up in anguish.

2LT Written Script: "But he.. he was in Baltimare! I-"

K: "I'm sorry." I shrugged, and hugged him around his neck. "If you need some time-"

2LT Written Script: "No.." He hugged me back with his forelegs. "I'm second in command of the company. I have to stay on duty. People are counting on me.. on us, K. We'll grieve later. But.. thank you." He pulled back and smiled a bit. "It's not going to be easy, telling Dad.. but.. I'll find a way." He shrugged.

And my last duty of the morning.. checking back in with the medical team overseeing Radiant's case. I made my way back to the ward she was in, and simply sat in one of the little pony chairs. Waiting.


TIME: 13:44 ERST

I must've dozed off, because I jumped when I heard her voice from the isolation unit. It wasn't clear - I couldn't understand what she was saying. But when I stood up and looked into the room, I could see she was moving around just fine. Screw the contamination risks - she looked stressed out. Afraid. She'd freaked - she was holding a scalpel, looking like a caged animal. I had to help her - so, I went in..

K: "Radiant.."

Radiant: "My name is not Radiant any longer." She stated with a firmness.

K: "..then what do I call you, Quartermaster Sergeant?" I plied.

Radio Active: "My name is now.. Radio Active." She said, running her right forehoof over her altered cutie mark. "I'm not the same pony I once was.." She said in a cautionary tone.

K: "I don't care." I replied, firmly. "You're still one of my soldiers, and I promise you, we are going to take care of you. I don't know what's happened to you, or quite how, but I will have answers to these questions. And once I do, I will tell you." I took a step towards her. "I'm your General. That makes your life, my responsibility. Don't think for a single moment that whatever has happened to you, is going to change that. I care about you - and no matter what's happened to you, I will always care about you." I kept my voice an even tone.

Radio: "But I'm a freak.. a freak.." She looked at herself. "..I'm not sure what I really am anymore!" She sobbed, exasperated.

K: "You're a soldier of the Royal Equestrian Army. You came back to Ponyville to help your friends, the citizens you swore an oath to protect, fellow soldiers you promised to fight alongside.. you came back to help - you're not a freak, you're still a friend." I said, keeping my palms visible.

Radio: "I did come back.." She said, as though she was just recalling it. "I.. I had to.." She shook her head.

K: "Because you still care. And I still care. And I know someone else that still cares - DAWN!" I yelled. And Dawn came in.

Dawn: "S-sergeant.." She stammered. "..it's me, Dawn." She said, stepping close to me. "I.. everyone else is dead but us. And I.. I don't care what happened to you - you're still MY friend! You'll always be my friend! Forever! No matter what! Please.. please believe that."

Radio: "I-I.." She dropped the scalpel - and I quickly kicked it away, moving up on her and not giving her a chance to react defensively.

K: "Lay down, Sergeant. Let us help you. Please. That's not an order - that's a friend asking."

Dawn: "Please..?" She implored.

Radio: "A-Alright." She said, letting me put her back in bed, and cover her up.

K: "Just relax. Try to get some rest, alright?" I looked at Dawn. "She won't be leaving your side. Any news, I'll make sure you're told. I promise."

Radio: "Thank you.." She nodded, and rest her head on her pillow. "Sorry.. I.. I'm so scared."

K: "It's alright to be scared. I'm scared every time I go out and do my job. I'm scared every day that ponies like you, won't be making it back home to the people that they love. So, it's alright to be scared - just know, we're right here." I reassured her.

She started to doze off almost right away, and I nodded to Dawn for her to stay right there with her. As I left the room to go track down one of the doctors, I resolved that I'd find out what happened here - and if it had a purpose. Some reason I wasn't seeing right away. Something that had a role in what was going on in Equestria.

I was going to have answers, one way or another.

Part 4: Contamination

TIME: 14:50 ERST
DATE: War Day 141
LOCATION: Ponyville Clinic

Word of Radio's personality change got around fast - the three nurses that were in the room with her when she first woke up, were rightly freaked by it. And to compound the situation, the company of Royal Army that Radio had been in when she was Quartermaster Sergeant Radiant Stratus, arrived to reinforce us. Commanding the company was Major Restless Field. Field was part of a family with a long history of service in Celestia's Royal Guards - he specifically transferred from her Earth Guards to a combat assignment, despite his age. He was.. well, not old, but not anywhere near Applejack and the girls.

I was out front when the unit came marching up - the nine remaining Squads, that is. After Gloom Mountain, I reorganized each military unit along specific standards of manpower. Each Infantry company had ten Squads in five Platoons - one HQ Squad, one Reserve Squad, six Line Squads divided into two Platoons, and a Weapons Platoon of two more Squads.

Maj. Field: "General. How soon can I have my soldiers back?" He asked, gruffly.

K: "I'm not sure, Major. You are aware that Quartermaster Sergeant Radiant Stratus.. was dead, at one point, right?" I asked, tilting my head.

Maj. Field: "Of course, but she has a duty to perform. And what of Corporal Earlylight?" He nodded, roughly.

K: "She's.. been through an awful lot, too, Major.. I'd like to see her get some rest before she even thinks of-"

Maj. Field: "Is she wounded, sir?" He butted in, accusingly.

K: "No, Major, she's not-" I let the first one go.

Maj. Field: "Then I have a squad to rebuild! I need her back immediately." He insisted, rudely (really? From a pony?).

K: "Major, Dawn isn't-" He walked away. HE WALKED AWAY FROM ME! Of all the NERVE! I shot a look to his Second-in-Command, Lieutenant Corner Sharpe. He gave me a fearful look like I was ready to shoot him.

So, I followed Major Field into the clinic. He was moving at a brisk trot - a speed that humans can't really approximate well. It was above a fast walk, and below a flat out run. He went RIGHT for Radio's room. Norfy and Gaze both saw me passing by, and must've seen the look on my face, because they followed me.

Major Field went RIGHT into the room, COMPLETELY ignoring the signs all around it, talking about isolation. Like he thought he knew better. And he was REALLY getting on my nerves. I mean REAL BAD.

Maj. Field: "Corporal Earlylight!" He barked.

She jumped.

Dawn: "Y-Yes, Major!" She snapped to attention.

Maj. Field: "Why are you not in uniform!? Where is your rifle!? Why haven't you reported to Company Headquarters!? We have DISCIPLINE in this Army, Corporal. And we have it for a reason!" *Huff* "Fall into formation outside. Move i-"

Radio: "She's not going anywhere.." She grumbled from her bed. "..leave her here."

Maj. Field: "Are you telling me what to do, Quartermaster Sergeant?! I don't believe what I'm hearing! And you look just fine - a little scarred up, but scars breed character! You ought be out in formation, too! The company needs its senior-most NCO!" He haughtily insisted.

Gaze (To Norfy): "Geeze, wha's his problem?"

Norfy (To Gaze): "He seems to be on top of things. Really, from what Nurse Lockedheart told us, Radiant was acting like a little emo.."

Doctor Well Wishes trotted up at this point.

Maj. Field: "Now, since you're in bed, of course, I can't order you into formation. That's not how things are done." He turned, seeing Dr. Well Wishes. Probably the worst person to do this with.. "DOCTOR! How soon can she be released?" He nodded at Radio. "I need my Quartermaster Sergeant. I hear she's been acting out in here - sounds like she needs a sample of good, strict discipline to me."

Dr. WW: *Glare* "She's still under testing, Major." He actually looked at me - and I just nodded at him. "She'll need to stay for a few days, at least, until we can determine-"

Maj. Field: "Poppycock!" He huffed up his chest. He was easily as big as Big Mac. "She looks just fine - and there's a war on. We need professional soldeiers - everypony we can get! Someone has to pick up the slack of the Militias."

Gaze looked ready to jump him. Norfy had to hold him back.

Dr. WW: "Well, she's MY patient, Major. And I say she stays." *Huff/Snort*

Maj. Field: "Nonsense! What'll testing tell you? She looks fine to me." He gestured at her.

K: "Doctor Well Wishes says she stays, Major, so, she st-"

Maj. Field: "General! If you expect me to be effective, I need all the personnel I can get! Including her. And especialy Corporal Earlylight. She isn't even wounded! Corporal!! Why are you not going to formation!?" He demanded of her, and interrupted me again.

Dawn: "I-I.."

K: . "..don't do that, Major. Don't ever do that! Don't you DARE interrupt me like that again! No, she's NOT wounded, but you know what, Major, that doesn't matter! I TOLD HER SHE COULD STAY HERE!" I stormed up to him.

Maj. Field: "And this is exactly why you shouldn't have been put in charge of such things, General! You weren't even in your own world's military! You have no idea how discipline works! All this soft pishy-poshy emotional stuff - it breeds a slovenly attitude! Just look at the Ponyville Militia! They let their ranks break just because of a few beasties!" He snarled.

K: *Twitch* "Did.. did you just question my authority, Major?"

I actually, melodramatically, cleaned out my ear with a q-tip offered by Dr. Well Wishes. He had a smirk on his face bigger than the time he chewed me out after Operation: Royal Oak.

Maj. Field: "I question your lack of discipline, General! And you understanding of how to conduct a proper company!" He huffed.

K: *Babble* "You-Just.. I-j'.. I can't believe my ears." I flapped my arms. "I'm being talked shit to, by an idiot." I gently spun on the balls of my left foot, spinning around and coming to face him.

Maj. Field: "IDIOT!? How DARE you!"

K: "NO, HOW DARE YOU!" I jammed a finger into his chest. "YOU DO NOT QUESTION YOUR ROYAL SOVEREIGN, AND LAST TIME I CHECKED, I WAS THE ONE SHE PUT IN CHARGE OF THIS ARMY!" My nostrils flared, and I snorted in his general direction. "You are quite possibly the worst example of an officer I have ever seen in my entire life.." I reached for his shoulder boards, but not only did he step back, he slapped my hand away.

Maj. Field: "Hands off my uniform!" He snorted at me.

K: "Oh, fuck you, that's the last fucking straw." I drew my PA-63 and aimed it at his head. "I was going to demote you, but fuck you and your pompus ass. You're under arrest. NORFY! GAZE! I WANT THIS PONY UNDER GUARD AND IN IRONS!" I nodded.

Gaze: "Och, lookit that, pompous ass got hisself all worked up, an' now look." He and Norfy started walking into the room.

Maj. Field: "THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!" He stormed at me. "HOW DARE YOU, YOU.. YOU.. ALIEN MONSTROSITY!" He went to take a swing at me.

Norfy: "NO!"

He got right in the way, and Major Field landed a right cross on his snout, knocking him back into me. I caught Norfy, but that forced me to drop my pistol. He drew his.

Maj. Field: "I REFUSE TO BE UNDER THE COMMAND OF SUCH A SOFT-HEARTED FLIP-FLOP! ARREST ME!? I ARREST YOU, SIR, FOR HIGH TREASON! AND YOU, CAPTAIN, FOR AIDING AND ABETTING AN INVADING ENEMY! AND WHEN I CONCLUDE YOUR TRIAL AND HANG YOU FOR TREASON, I WILL PERSONALLY LEAD THE ROYAL ARMY TO CHARGE INTO THE EVERFREE FOREST AND STOMP THE ENEMY THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY - WITH STEEL AND HOOVES!"

He aimed his Lee right at my head. My blood raced, I was terrified - even Gaze froze in place.

Dr. WW: "Major?"

Maj. Field: "WHAT IS IT, DOCTOR!?" He stormed at him.

Dr. WW: "I hereby pronounce you psychologially unfit for military service." He crossed his forelegs. "And since you're in MY hospital, you'll report to the General Ward immediately for treatment. I think electro-shock therapy should be effective."

Maj. Field: "HOW DARE YOU!" He spun to face the doctor. "YOU CAN JOIN HIM! ON THE GALLOWS! ALL OF YOU!" He aimed the Lee back at Norfy. "I WILL NOT LET EQUESTRIA BE SUBVERTED BY YOU TREASONOUS DIAMOND DOGS! YOU-"

*BANG!*

He fell to the ground, a perfect circle in the middle of his forehead. Norfy and I got the brunt of his brain matter. I had to take my glasses off and squint.

It was Radio. She'd managed to recover and manipulate the trigger on my PA-63 by jamming a scalpel in her leg, right above her hoof.

Radio: "Ass." And she collapsed again.


TIME: 15:33 ERST

Norfy, Gaze and I were done giving our statement to Vigilance and two Royal Guards. It was just so surreal.. that Major Field had done this.. that Radio.. she saved our lives, I was sure of it. I was seated in one of the staff rooms with Norfy and Gaze. My face still had his blood on it, but I'd cleaned my glasses.

Norfy: "Now I feel like a great big jerk.." He sighed.

Gaze: "Fer wot, mate?" He patted him on the back.

Norfy: "Here I thought Radio was just being a little emo pony.. but I forgot that she'd literally died and had come back. That.. she.. she's contaminated. Not.. not like my.." He trailed off, a little embarassed.

K: "Gaze has been sending me copies of your War Journals - your dreams are fascinating." I stated flatly.

Norfy: "I mean the Hydia dream, General. If that one was real - and it sure felt like it - then a past me has been.. well, I was contaminated myself. But with Necrooze, or some kind of variant of it." He shrugged. "I should really be more sympathetic to her situation.. she's been through so much. If anyone understands that, it should be me. Plus, she saved our lives."

K: "Well.. yeah, you're right. You don't have to be quite so hard on yourself, but you're right. Maybe you ought to have a talk with her?" I proffered.

Norfy: "Maybe you're right.." He nodded.

K: "And she could really use a friend right now." I nodded.

Norfy: "You know what, K, you're right! I'll go talk to her right away." And up he got, and out he went.

K: "Gaze.." I gestured.

Gaze: *Sigh* "Aye, aye, I'll go keep an eye on th' lad.." And out he went.

Dr. Well Wishes came in with a couple of paper cups filled with hot tea, and some muffins. He set them down in front of me, then sat down across from me.

Dr. WW: "I owe you.. such a big apology.. I.." He sighed.

K: "Look.." I shrugged. "..you have your views, and you got them stomped on." I looked at the tea and muffins. "Peace offering?"

Dr. WW: "I'm sorry it's not Pizza." He shrugged. "I learned something today, K. You're not -the most- blood-thirsty warmonger in the Kingdom. And you're probably the least of all evils - at least you care about everyone under you, and you think real hard about minimizing carnage when you make your battle plans. For that alone, I should be supporting you instead of calling you names."

K: "I like having a moral compass, though!" I said, picking up a muffin. "Someone like you to remind me.. of the other side of the argument. So, go ahead and criticize me.. just make sure it's constructive, is all I ask." I shrugged. "And I forgive you - I forgave you every time, you just didn't hear it. That's what my Faith is all about. Forgiveness. Always." I gave him a small smile.

Dr. WW: "Thank you.. I didn't like that on my conscience." He shrugged and lifted the tea cup. "Let this war be over soon, K. Please. I've had enough meatball surgery."

K: "To a fast end, Doctor, that your career is full of sniffly noses and hayfever." I raised my cup and touched his. "Cheers."


TIME: 16:47 ERST

So, after listening to Dr. Well Wishes Med School Antics for a while, I went to check on Gaze and Norfy. I found Gaze wandering the halls, checking on some of his wounded ponies..

K: "Gaze? Why aren't you with Norfy?" I asked, a little surprised.

Gaze: "Oh.. aye.. well, they gots to talkin' 'bout past lifes an' all, an' I figger'd it weren't me place, so.." He shrugged.

K: *Sigh* "Well, let's go check on him, at least." I said, leading the way to the Isolation Room.

And when we got there.. OH. MY. GOD.

{From inside the room, muffled by thick glass} Radio: *AHH-AHH-AHHHHH* "YES! YES!" *NGH* "CONTAMINATE ME!" *Squeal*

I stared through the crack in the curtain a moment, then looked at Gaze.

K: "Is Norfy vocal at all, during sex?" I asked, as though he'd know.

Gaze: *BLUSH* "Uh-I-Er.." *COUGH* "N-Not tha' I'd know of, General! But then again, I dinnae think he an' Corporal Campanula hae been doin' it in th' 'partment, suh!" He backed away. "I.. think I hae.. weppins inventory tae take.. right.. BYE!" And off he ran.

I stared a moment.. then shook my head and walked away. Norfy the Pimp? Well.. he seems to have that special touch.. with at least two women so far.

Lucky him! And lucky for me! HAH! For ONCE there was a "broken" girl that didn't want to automatically jump my bones! I was a bit giddy as I made my way to the General Ward to check on the Girls again, before I'd have to head off to Militia headquarters and see about the next phase of the plan..

Part 5: Tension

TIME: 17:12 ERST
DATE: War Day 141
LOCATION: Ponyville Militia Headquarters

After the drama at the hospital, newly-promoted Captain Corner Sharpe was discussing battle plans with the other officers. Luna was on her way back from Manehattan - Celestia and the entire (newly organized) 2nd Battalion of the Royal Army were holding Canterlot - just in case. I warned her that Grogar's specific foot soldiers - those resurrected husks and things - were actually strong enough and resilient enough that they specifically countered most of my preparations and inventions.

After all, I never considered the possiblity of Necromancy.

I had the largest assemblage of military force that Equestria had yet fielded. I had eleven senior, and over a dozen junior officers and senior NCO's in the room with me - most of them, I'd worked with before. Even Aero Dart showed up - and I had confidence in him after our adventure in the islands. Despite him initially treating war like a family business, he'd wizened after his first exposure to fire, and had a more serious attiude. I pegged him as making Colonel sooner or later.

K: "Alright, everyone.." I finally sidled up to the sand table showing the area. "..it's time for what would have been Phase 3 if we hadn't had a little godly action going on there. We have a huge force at our disposal, but this runs the risk of communication failure and confusion if we aren't absolutely careful about what we do, and how we do it. We have to make absolutely certain of this plan - if there are ANY questions, I want you all to speak up. Understood?"

*Murmurs of agreement*

K: "Alright.. Gilda has been so kind as to run recon over the forest almost nonstop since the end of the last phase of the battle, so we have a fantastic idea of what forces Grogar has at his disposal." *Sharp inhale* "He.. can basically counter everything we have."

*Murmuring of discontent*

K: "We can't rely on.. formerly Quartermaster Sergeant Radiant Stratus to be there to pull our fat from the fire. We have to do this ourselves. The bad news is, Grogar has flying monsters - fortunately, we have fighter squadrons for that. More bad news - he has half the forest in this area as Treants - they resist bullets quite well. Fortunately, we have Napalm." I looked at them all.. trying to meet everyone's eyes at least once. "My plan is to start this with a three-hour bombardment of the forest using napalm shells from our artillery, and napalm bombs from the Close Air Support Squadrons."

*Murmuring of objection*

K: "Okay.. I hear disapproval about this. Let's hear it - raised hooves please." I pointed at one in the back. "You. Go."

Lt. Wild Wing: "Napalm strikes on the forest, sir.. that's awfully destructive to the environment, isn't it?"

K: "Yes, yes it is. I'm more than willing to admit that my plan calls for burning down over half of the Everfree Forest."

*Murmurs of shock*

K: "Okay.. does anyone have a better idea?" I paused a moment. "Think about this - Grogar is using the forest itself as a weapon. He could attack at any time, and if he does, we will likely get pushed back into town again, as we will be unable to kill them fast enough to prevent another breach of our defenses. He can keep hammering us until he simply runs out of trees and corpses, then flee, find another place with dead things, and do it all over again. If we get pushed back enough, we will be forced to shell more and more of the town, until there isn't one any longer." I shrugged.

A raised hoof. Norfy - what a surprise.

K: "Go ahead, Norfy - though I think I know what's on your mind already."

Norfy: "What about Zecora, sir?" He didn't need to ask more.

K: "Excellent point, Captain. No, really, it is. Zecora is about the only person that might have had a solution to all of this." I shrugged. "I've already talked to her about it. There's nothing she can do, really. Her cabin and her collections of rare ingredients were destroyed.. even if there was something she could mix up that could dispel necromancy, she no longer has the supplies to do it with, nor would she likely have had enough to make more than a dent in the enemy. She's researching alternatives with Twilight and the girls at the Library - hence why they're not here, nor will  they be taking the front lines. Zecora does think there might be an alternative using magic instead of potions, but she isn't sure. I've given her until 23:00, Royal Time, to give me an alternative, or the definite promise of one. If I can have some kind of alternative to simply firebombing the forest into ash, I will do it - even if it means stopping the bombing right in the middle of the operation and launching a special high risk mission to do it. Any alternative presented to me, that has a chance of saving lives or property, I will accept. Unfortunately, science really only has one answer to the living dead and trees that walk - and that's napalm. In this case, Science really will fuck you." I shrugged.

Gaze: "Sorry - ye mean ANY alternative?" He had his hoof up, but spoke immediately anyway.

K: "Do you have an idea, Captain? I'm willing to entertain any line of productive thought."

Gaze: "Uh.." He looked at Norfy. "..see, I specialize in physical magic, suh. Not elemental stuff, like Cap'n Norf here.." *Ahem* "..there wuz an old family legend 'bout a necromancer troublin' us at one time. Sit'cha'ation much like this'un, suh, but wi'out science, y'see?"

K: "Go on, we're listening."

Gaze: "Issa funny thin', suh.. one'a me ancestors wuz able to learn a specific spell what dispelled necromancy on contact." He shrugged.

K: "Details, man, details!" I made hand gestures.

Gaze: "Tha's the thin', suh. I'd haf'ta go back'ta me home an' look't'up. I dun' remember all'a the details. I's inn'a old spell book. Been pas't down fer centuries. Me Grammy wan't'da donate it ta a museum, suh, but Great-Grammy 'bout beat her over the head fer thinkin' 'bout it, so, I ended up wi'it.." *Cough* "..I never really read it - jes heard stories from Grammy. She di'int believe much innit.." He shrugged.

K: "This is exactly what I mean when I say 'Approach me with alternatives' people - Gaze here has a fantastic lead. Gaze? Take a squad back to Detrot, and get that book. Take Luna's carriage, tell the pilots 'best possible speed.'" I made "shoo" gestures. "Go, go, go!"

Gaze: "Aye, suh!" And off he went.

I knew Astral Sky's top cruising speed was closer to Dash's.. the carriage used magic to more or less make it weightless to those pulling it.. if she pushed herself to her top speed for the entire trip there and back, Gaze should have just enough time to get this thing and get back.

K: "Alright, then. Hopefully that will bear fruit." I nodded. "But in case it doesn't, this is the plan." I pointed to the forest area the monsters were identified in. "One hour of bombardment, commencing at 23:00 hours. At midnight, we march into the scorched remains. I've called for extra Knox grenade launchers and flare guns from every available source - I want them handed out, two Knox per squad, everyone with a Flare Gun, for Treants. Cavalry will lead the advance, followed by Rangers as skirmishers, and Infantry bringing up the rear. Dex!" I looked over at him.

Dex: "Yo, General-Dude-Sir!" He stepped up.

K: "You have overall command of both the Paddock County Rangers and First Royal, since I had someone escort Derpy to Canterlot.. very much agianst her will." I gestured.

*Chuckles all around*

Dex: "Do my best, dude-sir!" He nodded with an affirming smirk. "Earth Ponies are borne of this, dude." He thumped his chest with pride.

K: "Alright, alright, good." I nodded. "As we advance, I want the CAS Squadrons ready for precision strikes - that means loitering above the battlefield for instant response to smoke markers. I want Fighters protecting them at all costs."

Aero Dart: "On it, SIR!" He nodded, with an affirmative huff.

K: "Spitfire?" I looked to her.

Spitfire: "Yes, General?" She nodded.

K: "Half your team is down, so, I want you performing Close Observation and Artillery Marking instead, along with Gilda's Cloudriders. Mitchells and Smoke Shells. Make sure you have a couple of Radios to call in shell adjustments." I pointed to the extras.

Spitfire: "You got it, General." She stood tall.

K: "Once we're in the ruins of the forest, our main task is finding either Bray or Grogar himself." I shrugged. "Unfortunately, miss Katrina was not a help in terms of Intelligence, she simply spent far too much time under the influence of Witchweed to be of any help at all, so, we need Grogar alive."

*Bitching and moaning*

K: "I KNOW! I KNOW! He did something... I didn't think that sort of thing even happened here, but.. he must be brought in alive and AS UNHARMED AS POSSIBLE." I scowled. "I may have to trade him a guarantee of living in exchange for the information we need. As big of a threat as he is, he takes orders from Rep, it seems, and Rep knows where Tirek's little offshore factory is located - meaning Grogar may know as well. Our ultimate goal is to deny Tirek that Factory at all costs. We're certain he's planning an invasion - we have to stop it, and we may not have much of a chance if the enemy is armed as well as we are, and as well supplied. Our main advantage over Tirek is diversity of arms and experience. If he can match all our weapons, we'll be in serious trouble." I scratched my chin. "If we repel Tirek's invasion, we can counter-invade him and end this war."

Major Shire Stallion: "That how they do it back home General?" He tilted his head up above the crowd as he talked.

K: "No, but that grand strategy is the most effective - get Tirek to expend the majority of his best forces on our home field, then hit him while he's weakened. Back home, I'd have access to strategic nuclear weapons already, and we'd simply erase a few of his major cities, then invade." I shrugged. "But I have no intentions of building atomic weapons here. This is bad enough."

Even if I knew just enough about them, to possibly build a Gun-type Atomic Bomb, I wasn't going to even attempt it. Even if several pounds of highly enriched Uranium or Plutonium was just dumped in my lap (in a lead blanket!), there was NO way I was going to build an Atomic Bomb in Equestria.

Well, okay, I might, but only if every pony was dead, and it was me versus Tirek's entire army. Then, yes, I would, because it wouldn't matter any more at that point.

K: "Alright, alright, let's focus here. Now, after we start advancing into whatever remains of the forest - call this Phase Four - I want us to break off into platoon-sized formations. One squad Cavalry, the rest Infantry. Rangers and Marines seperate. We probe in small units, identify pockets of resistance, and all nearby forces respond and overwhelm them. If needed, we call in Air or Artillery support. I want the 3rd Royal Infantry and 1st Royal Cavalry in reserve in case we find more pockets than we can readily respond to."

*Murmurs and affirmations of agreement*

K: "Once anyone locates Grogar, everyone is to respond immediately - he must be taken alive. Same with Bray.. he must be taken alive, as he may know where Grogar is hiding. If we find and capture Grogar first, Bray is expendable - if he doesn't surrender, treat him like any other foot soldier." I continued. "Bray will look like.. well, like a really bucked-up donkey. Alright, get your squad assignments set up for Phase Four.. Air Force units, get your Flyers ready for the bombing run. And Cosmic?"

Cosmic Plane: "Uh, yes, General?" He paced forwards.

K: "I'm giving you command of the Artillery for this. You have overall responsibility for directing and organizing fire missions." I nodded to him.

Cosmic: "Do my best, sir, you know that." He nodded.

K: "Alright. Let's go everyone." I pointed at them.

I shooed them off to handle the micromanaging aspects of the operation - which squad would go with which, who has to lug the Knox, that sort of thing. Meanwhile, I went into Scoots' house, and found myself a comfortable spot on her living room floor. I needed some rest. Harv came in after me. It smelled like she had started cooking something for dinner.

K: "Harv, catchin' a couple hours. Wake me for anything urgent - and just save me some food, I'll eat when I get up." I said, getting cozy.

Golden Harvest: "Of course, K." She nodded to me.

She gave me a warm smile, and went back to cooking. Smelled like her famous Forest Vegetable Stew - a non-meat dish I would regularly get seconds and thirds of. Militia Commander, Cook, and adoptive mother. She was truly a marvel - everyone always looks at The Girls as being superwomen, but really, there was no way I could even hope to win this war without ponies like Harv, Script.. Gaze, Norfy, Cosmic, Dex, Spirit, and now, Radio.. Derpy, even.. all of them. I considered this as I took off my field jacket, glasses, boots, and pistol belt. I set them all nearby - boots were opened enough that I could throw my feet into them right away, and run if I had to. Heck, Mayor Mare was buzzing around, too, trying to help out as best she could in a support capacity - she refused to leave her town, and I would always respect her for that.

I think she was the one that put the blanket over me.


TIME: 22:14 ERST

I woke up with a jerk. Another nightmare.. I didn't bother telling anyone I was having them - Norfy's were ungodly more horrible and frightening. Mine were normal things - nightmares of failure, my failure. Deaths of friends. Discord. More. Worse. There was a big bowl of soup and a pot of tea sitting on the end table for me. I sat and ate.. just.. trying to wrap my head around the level of destruction I was about to unleash. After eating, I got up, re-dressed - and found that Mac or someone had brought me both my personal Zhukov and my Sherman, so I had a choice of what I wanted to bring with me. I picked the Zhukov - I could carry more mags more easily with it, the magazine pouch was easier to put on my pistol belt and held eight 30-round magazines.

Geared up, I checked my watch. Forty-five minutes - and no one had come to wake me with an alternative. That meant I had to prepare to order the incineration of a very large swath of the Everfree Forest. I'd be remembered for that.. just like I'd be remembered for bombing the old palace to smithereens.. really, I was looking at racking up a real laundry list of destroyed monuments here.

I walked outside, seeing everyone moving about quickly, making final preparations. The impromptu air field was buzzing with support units making sure Bomb Racks were loaded, water troughs were filled, and hay carts ready to "refuel" the Flyers as they came back from dropping ordinance. It was an impressive operation. The largest we'd ever undertaken - and here I thought Gloom Volcano was a big deal.

As I strode out towards the barn, I committed myself to this operation - I was going to give the order, and hope the consequences weren't so bad. I put out of my mind, all of the little forest animals that were going to die, the potential casualty count - I hadn't even bothered really looking at Casualty Lists yet, just raw numbers.. I could see Luna in the barn, going over the plan with Golden.. her eyes looked up and met mine.. she could see the pain in my heart, I was sure of it.

I was about to speak, about to say something, when everything around me seemed to fill with a purple light.

Funny thing? I never heard it coming.
