Part 1: Dodger City Dodging

TIME: 18:24 ERDT
DATE: War Day 704/8 Tertious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Fort Dodger, Konzas

Six hours and our reinforcements would arrive. In that time, I wanted Fort Dodger back under my control. I led my team out of town, after sending the train ahead to the next stop and acquiring a full load of equipment for everyone.

We made our way on the outside of the town, to avoid any further combat if possible. I didn't want to kill them. I didn't want to have to arrest them for High Treason, either. If we could kill Mason Jarson, we had a chance to get his troops to simply quit. And I'd let them go, too, as long as they didn't start any more problems.

Fort Dodger was on Mason's land, interestingly enough, and I recalled Rarity bringing up how Mr. Jarson agreed to lease the land to the Royal Government. From what I'd learned from Miss May, Mason was also charging rent - which he shouldn't be.

We were 250 meters from the edge of the fort, and as I had trained, there was very, very little cover or concealment. The ground had been cleared well. These ponies knew their business. That made my job harder.

I was behind one of the only pieces of cover available - a dried up riverbed that ran along the edge of the fort's lands. It was shallow, but deep enough to afford cover. Ahead, I could see the tower was manned, and two guards were posted out front.

Gaze: "Plan, suh?" He asked, glancing at me.

K: "Diplomacy first." I stood up, and walked to the road. "Cover me. Teddy." I nodded at the tower. "Mac." I nodded to the guards at the front.

Teddy: "Zeroed in, K." He took careful position and aim.

Mac: "Gotcha, brother." He set up the Merill carefully.

I walked alone towards the gate guards. I wasn't going to be dumb enough to just walk right in close. I called out to them when I was 50 meters away.

K: "ATTENTION AT THE FORT!" I called to the guards. I saw the watch tower immediately draw a bead on me, but it held fire.

Army Corporal: "WE HEAR YOU! ADVANCE AND GIVE THE COUNTER SIGN!" He stood his ground.

K: "RED SAND!" The non-comms line code word for the day. "RED, TWO SEVEN, SAND!" The page number in section RED of the code book.

Army Corporal: "CODES WERE CHANGED! THAT'S NOT VALID!" He raised his rifle. "IDENTIFY YOURSELF!"

K: "I'M YOUR TARTARUS-DAMNED GENERAL, FOR CELESTIA'S SAKE! SCREW YOUR HEAD ON, CORPORAL! I WANT TO KNOW WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE, AND WHY THE CODES WERE CHANGED!" I rested my hand on my Canidan Hi-Power.

Army Corporal: "CODES WERE CHANGED ON CAPTAIN AIRE'S ORDERS! THE MAJOR HAD AN ACCIDENT - HE'S IN CHARGE! IF YOU WERE REALLY THE GENERAL, YOU'D KNOW THAT!" He still didn't fire.

K: "YES, I WOULD, IF CAPTAIN AIRE WASN'T A TRAITOR!" I retorted. "STAND DOWN, I'M IN COMMAND, HERE!" I demanded.

Army Corporal: "I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT YOU, BUT YOU BETTER NOT COME ANY CLOSER! WE WERE WARNED TIREK WAS UP TO SOMETHING!"

K: "GO GET THE CAPTAIN!" I ordered. "NOW!" I looked up at the watch tower, staring the markspony in the eye.

I didn't know it, but Dusty wasn't taking my daringness well. AJ would have been keeping close aim on my threats. Dusty was, but she was extremely worried.. almost out of her mind.

I saw one of the tower guards move back and descend the tower. I was going to force a confrontation. I already knew I had an advantage - that Corporal could have shot me, but didn't. They refused.

After several minutes, the Captain exited the fort, with three more ponies guarding him. He stayed close to the gate, his own Morgan out and in one hoof.

K: "Captain Aire. You're under arrest for High Treason to Princess Celestia!" I pointed at him. "As for the rest of you? The forces from Fort Barned are on their way here. Any pony that stands with him, HANGS with him, or dies fighting their own comrades." I crossed my arms. "I am your General! Appointed by Celestia herself. I built this army from the ground up! EACH and EVERY one of you is able to be here because of me." I looked the Captain in the eyes. "So, who do you side with? The human that's treated you like his own foals, who's wounded himself numerous times fighting at the front lines WITH you, nearly died fighting Tirek, avoided a war with the Herdintern Pact.. or this jerk." I cocked my nose towards him.

They stopped, and the Corporal lowered his rifle.

Capt. Aire: "You're not real." He dismissively commented. "You're a trick. Sent by Tirek. Probably the same one that hurt the Major."

K: "You're a traitor. You sold out your command, and your soul, to Mason Jarson. The same pony that you allow to cheat your soldiers out of their pay." I retorted. "And I bet, you tried your best to murder the Major, too." I shrugged my shoulders with crossed arms. "And for what? What did you get out of it?" I looked at the other soldiers.

Capt. Aire: "Nothing! Lies! All of it!" He dismissively waved his hoof, keeping his Morgan aimed at me.

K: "Is that so? Then, how do you explain the soldiers having to pay Mason Jarson? Or were you taking 'rent' from them yourself?" I looked at the soldiers around him, again.

Capt. Aire: "That's.. that was.. I-"

Army Staff Sergeant: "Come to think of it, you ARE the one saying we have to pay a percentage of our paychecks to Mason!" He looked between the Captain and me.

K: "The way we set up the land lease, the Royal Government should have handled everything. You soldiers shouldn't owe anyone a dime." I shook my head slowly.

Army Corporal: "And what ABOUT the Major, Captain?" He turned his head towards him. "YOU said it was an accident!"

Capt. Aire: "That's... it's all a trick! He's trying to trick us!"

Tower Sniper: "Really, now?" She leaned over. "I've been stuck on Tower duty the last ten hours. Why WERE the Codes changed, sir?"

K: "Your troops are starting to wonder, Captain." I nodded at him. "I think the jig is up."

He quickly backed away from them, and angled himself between us, retreating.. actually, towards the dry streambed.

Capt. Aire: "Stay back! ALL of you!" He was sweating.

Just like a pony to crack under pressure like this. They were naturally good creatures, so, when they were given over to deception and betrayal, they didn't have the flexible morals to stand strong under pressure like this. They cracked, they spilled the beans, their good nature forcing them to confess.

K: "As I thought. TEDDY!" I called out.

*THWACK!*

And just like that, the Captain hadn't a brain.

I stood there, and looked at the soldiers.

K: "Lower your weapons. Me and my staff are coming in!" I demanded.

Army Staff Sergeant: "YOU heard the GENERAL!" He barked.

I walked past all of them. I didn't say a word. On the one hand, I was proud that they were willing to risk it all like that, and maintained good security, but on the other hand.. well, they thought I was some kind of trick.

We went to the Infirmary. Major Colton Whinny was laying on one of the beds, tended-to by a Medic.

K: "Cody." I nodded

Dr. Allcome moved over and inspected the injuries, and the bandages on him.

Fort Dodger Medic: "Captain Aire was there when the accident happened - he said that part of the warehouse roof collapsed on him, and he was impaled on a splintered beam." He nodded.

Dr. Allcome: "Ah, yes. Ah.. what.. what medical training have you, young sir?" He looked at the Medic over the rims of his glasses as Nurse Sweetheart moved in and started changing the bandages.

Fort Dodger Medic: "I.. uh.. my father was a dentist. Before the war, I worked at his office in Kichai." He shrugged.

Dr. Allcome: "Woefully under-educated for the role." He shook his head. "Army Medical Training is all you received, yes?"

Fort Dodger Medic: "Y-Yes, Captain." He nodded.

Dr. Allcome: "No wonder you couldn't tell the difference between being clubbed over the head and stabbed with a knife, and a collapsed roof and splintered beam." He 'tsk-tsk-tsk'd the Medic, and completed his examination.

Fort Dodger Medic: "Y-uh! I-I.." He stammered.

Dr. Allcome: "I'm going to recommend you be transferred to Ponyville Hospital for a few months, so you can be trained by my colleagues." He looked at me. "His left kidney is crushed, and he has a severe concussion." A shrug.

K: "Can he heal that?" I tilted my head.

Dr. Allcome: "Not here, he can't. Moreover, with the damage to his Kindey, it will likely have to be removed. He's done as a front line officer." He shook his head.

Braeburn: "Aw.. well, he c'n come on back to Appleloosa! Bet'cha we c'n find him some Militia duties!" He nodded.

Dr. Allcome: "Actually, Braeburn, I would encourage him to retire. With only one kidney, he's going to be a bit weak, and his diet will have to be closely monitored." He frowned. "I suppose duty in Recruitment Command or some administrative-only position wouldn't be TOO demanding." And shook his head.

K: "I'm guessing he'll need a proper hospital." I grimaced.

Dr. Allcome: "As soon as we can manage it. I think the Town Hospital will be alright for the time being, until we get this mess cleaned up, but afterwards, he must be sent to a first-class medical center. Kichai or Twopeaka." He nodded. "Make certain he gets a catheter, Kind." He nodded to Sweetheart.

K: "Lovely." I shook my head. "Sergeant!" I demanded the NCO from earlier.

Army Staff Sergeant: "Yes, General!" He snapped to attention.

K: "Who would be the First Company Commander?" I tilted my head.

Army Staff Sergeant: "Second Lieutenant Scrabbler Brush, sir." He nodded.

K: "There's no one here between the rank of 2nd Lieutenant and Captain Aire?" I shrugged.

Army Staff Sergeant: "No, General." He shrugged.

K: "Bring me Lieutenant Brush." I nodded.

Lovely.. Captain Aire probably made darn sure the Fort was short of officers. For a fort-based Company, the Major would be in command, and the Captain below him would be executive officer. However, the First Platoon Commander should also be a Captain, and a First Lieutenant as Intelligence Officer.

This was getting better and better all the time.

[End of Part 1]

Part 2: Showdown at Three Circles Ranch

TIME: 07:43 ERDT
DATE: War Day 705/9 Tertious 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Three Circles Ranch, Konzas

Major Wagoner and his troops arrived just after Midnight. We'd quartered them at the Fort. Lieutenant Brush, though the most senior of the 2nd Lieutenants, was.. shakey, at best. I could see that Captain Aire had been hard at work making certain there were no officers of respectable bearing that could replace him or rat on him.

Now, we were going to take Mason.

The 9th Troop of Cavalry from Fort Barned, and the 27th Infantry Company from Fort Dodger were with me, spreading out and taking cover, as we approached the Three Circles Ranch. The terrain was a bit broken, over here, with dump piles of timbers, earth, and rock everywhere. It was an assaulter's dream.

Maj. Wagoner: "Again, General, I apologise." He shook his head, as he moved with me. "I won't let such a thing happen again."

K: "I'm sure you won't, Major." I said, taking shelter with him, Dusty, and Gaze about 70 meters from the ranch house.

Gaze: "S'gut'we got so much cover. Wonner how many nasties he's got up in there?" Gaze frowned.

K: "We're about to find out." I raised my head up, and shouted. "MASON JARSON! THIS IS GENERAL K OF THE EQUESTRIAN MILITARY! YOUR RANCH IS SURROUNDED! DROP YOUR WEAPONS AND COME OUT WITH YOUR HOOVES UP!"

Silence. I nodded to Teddy. He was behind a large rock about 10 meters from me and to my right.

Teddy: "I can see movement, sir!" He nodded towards the house.

K: "Major, bring up the Funstons." I nodded to him.

Maj. Wagoner: "ANTI-TAAANK!" He called out.

In short order, a squad from the company's Anti-Tank Platoon came up, with three Funston rocket launchers, and plenty of ammo.

K: "JARSON! LAST CHANCE! COME OUT WITH YOUR HOOVES UP, OR I'M BRINGING THE BUILDING DOWN ON TOP OF YOU!!" I yelled as loud as I could. "Ready rockets." I nodded to the Squad.

Corporal Bigger Bangers: "Funstons armed and ready." He and the other two set up.

I waited a bit longer.

K: "COUNTING DOWN FROM TEN!" I looked at the Colonel. "We fire at two." I said.

Maj. Wagoner: "Aye." He nodded to the next team back up the line, and again, until everyone got the message.

K: "TEN.. NINE.. EIGHT.. SEVEN.. SIX.. FIVE.. FOUR.. THREE...!"

Jarson: "WAIT! WAIT! DON'T SHOOT! DON'T SHOOT!" Out from the ranch house poured Jarson and about two dozen of his ponies.

Maj. Wagoner: "Well." He blinked, and holstered his Morgan. "That.. that works."

K: "SECURE THE PRISONERS!" I pointed at them.

Dusty, Braeburn and Chem were in the lead before I finished talking. The prisoners were tackled to the ground, and tied up. Me and The Lads came pacing up with Major Wagoner.

K: "Mason Jarson..?" I.. actually didn't know which one he was.

Lone Stranger: "He's the fat one, General." He nodded to the portly stallion.

Mason Jarson: "General K." He stated, looking down. His voice and demeanor reminded me of what Edward Asner might look like and sound like, if he was a Pony, early middle aged, and a cowboy.

K: "What do I charge you with, Mr. Jarson?" I squatted down to face him at his eye level.

Mason Jarson: "Well. Corruption of a public official.. maybe.. damaging the environment?" He looked from side to side, nervously.

K: "I'm thinking High Treason." I narrowed my eyes at him. "Seventy ponies - your ponies, or ponies you corrupted with bits or offers of free reign to do evil - are dead. Captain Aire is dead. Major Colton Whinney is severely injured. The ponies from Fort Dodger were robbed of tens of thousands of Bits of pay. You deliberately re-routed the river to deny water to the town unless they paid extortion money to you. You corrupted the local Judge, the Mayor, and the entire Gendarmes unit assigned here. Give me ONE REASON why I shouldn't get Cousin Braeburn's rope and string you up from the nearest tree?" I got my face close to his.

Mason Jarson: "Aha-heh.. well.. maybe.. I turn Crown Evidence?" He smiled weakly. "I'm not the big boss."

I rolled back on my heels.

K: "Speak." I cocked a brow.

Mason Jarson: "I want a deal!" He stated emphatically.

K: "Okay. The deal is I don't execute you." I nodded at him. "If I got to do things my way? It'd be the second time in my life I've eaten Pony. That's what I think of you, Jarson." And narrowed my eyes.

Norfy: "He'll do it, too. He ate the King of Cowrea for less." He smirked, ice cold. "And I'm not nearly as skilled at extracting the good organs as his dear wife.. but he trusts me with the task."

Cosmic: "He'll do it alive, too." He added.

K: "Anything beyond execution depends on the evidence you give me." I nodded, not changing my tone nor stare.

Mason Jarson: "OKAY! Okay.. I get it." He snorted. "Sir Hitcher Rose." A frown. "He has a huge estate south of here, on the other side of the river. He's the one that put me up to this. He said I could rule this area and take in all the money I could wring from it, as long as he got a cut. Most of these ponies? His ponies. They're just assigned to me." He shook his head. "He's working for Tirek.. I found that out last night after your little shootout chased most of the ponies off." He grunted and shifted in his binds a little. "He sent a messenger to warn me.. scare me into not giving up. He told me he had everything covered. Aire was his pony! Not mine. That messenger.. was a Raptorian."

Everyone gasped.

K: "Well. We've sure gotten ourselves into SOMETHING.." My mouth twitched.. Tirek had a base of ops in the heartland of Equestria.

Maj. Wagoner: "What do we do, General?" He looked at me.

K: "Captain Plains?" I addressed the second-highest-ranked officer Major Wagoner had brought with him.

Capt. White Plains: "Yes, General?" She was a stocky, tough, middle aged Paint female that had once run the Pony Express post in Fort Barned.

K: "I'm giving you command of Fort Dodger until I can get a replacement - take direct command of the 27th Infantry." I nodded to her.

Capt. White Plains: "Yes, General." She moved over a bit, and looked back to me. "We're going after Hitcher Rose, aren't we?"

K: "Yes." I nodded. "We need further reinforcements, though. I'm not assaulting what may well be a major enemy base with two companies and change." I shook my head. "Back to the Train. Bring the prisoners."

I was going to have to activate every town Militia in the area, and possibly more.. I knew what resources I had, and I knew I'd win.. the question was, how many of my ponies would suffer?

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Wild West War

TIME: 14:57 ERDT
DATE: War Day 705/9 Tertious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Dodger City, Konzas

K: C> "Fort Supply, this is Alpha Actual. Do you copy, over?" I was trying to reach the nearest proper military fort besides Fort Barned - Fort Supply, Sequoyah (Oklahoma).

Gaze: "Ah think issoutta range, suh." He shook his head. "We're talkin' well ovah a hundred kilometers." He glanced at the radio wire. "Oi, Spitfire. Git th' aerial off'a th' roof. Coz, can ye splice some ex'ter cable?"

Dex: "I can do it, dude. I do it all the time." He stepped in.

Norfy: "Ah, I see what you're doing. Yes, another.. thirty five feet of wire should do it." He nodded, and went rummaging.

Dusty: "Here, Dex. Got the tool kit for you." She held it in her mouth - how Ponies could (usually) talk well, while holding things in their teeth, always got to me.

I just sat back and let them work. It was refreshing to see them all work together, and moreover, solve a war problem without even so much as a request on my part.

Cosmic: "I'll direct Spitfire." He nodded, and went outside with her.

After a few minutes, Spitfire was hovering about 20 feet off the roof of the train, and I was trying again, the aerial in her hoof, and the wire leading to it, lengthened.

K: "Good work, everyone!" I nodded. C> "Fort Supply, this is Alpha Actual. How copy, over?"

Fort Supply Comspony: C> "This is Fort Supply. We read you, five by five, Alpha Actual. Over?"

K: C> "Condition Red. The 52nd Motorized from Fort Supply, and 10th Armored Cavalry from Fort Nickles, are to muster and respond to Fort Dodger, Konzas, along with any town militia units from Sequoyah and Konzas you can find. Take the Cimmaron Trail, not the direct route. An enemy encampment of unknown strength is located south of Fort Dodger. Extra motor units should be brought, to expedite movement of Militia assets, as possible. Over."

Fort Supply Comspony: C> "Message received and understood. Will report back with an ETA after 52nd Infantry reaches Fort Nickles. Over."

K: C> "Excellent. With all due haste, Fort Supply. Alpha Actual, out."

Norfy: "So, we're going to wait?" He sat, and looked at me with a nod. "Those tanks should be very handy.."

K: "Since I can, yes. Major Wagoner?" I looked to him.

Maj. Wagoner: "Yes, General?" He stiffened up a bit.

K: "Call the 9th Artillery in from Fort Barned. I want those guns." I nodded.

Maj. Wagoner: "Yes, General!" He moved to the Comms unit, as I stepped out of the closet and over to my planning table.

Cosmic: "I'll take command of the artillery unit." He nodded. "My specialty, and all."

Dusty: "Well.." She blinked. "..I guess now we'll see how having this new mechanized military force will work out."

K: "For once, we won't be invading a hostile shore. We're taking back a piece of our home that we didn't know was stolen." I shrugged a bit. "You are right, though, this'll be the first live test of mechanized warfare."

Norfy: "Do you think this will be enough?" He looked at the radio closet. "Three Infantry companies, an Armored Cavalry company, and an Artillery Battery?" He assessed the forces I'd called for.

K: "In addition to at least two companies of Militia." I nodded. "They're every bit as good as line infantry. We might even get a Ranger Company, we'll have to see."

Cosmic: "It should be plenty." He smirked. "Given the size of the property we're going to be attacking, we should have enough forces to stop them."

Gaze: "Should we pass a message along t'th' capital, suh?" He tilted his head at me.

K: "Yeeahh.. yeah, let's do that." I shrugged. "Colonel?"

Maj. Wagoner: "All finished, sir." He stepped out. "The artillery is coming by truck.. it'll be a bit before it gets here. Captain Hammerstrike says 19:30 or thereabouts." He nodded.

K: "That'll work. We'll prep and make camp overnight, and attack at dawn." I nodded, and stepped into the comms closet. C> "Relay, relay, this is Alpha Actual."

This would call up the nearest radio relay system - while it was nowhere near complete in its coverage across Equestria, it could get to certain points. Essentially, when called for, it opened a dedicated radio frequency, and it piped the transmissions from one radio relay to another. The audio quality degraded the further the distance, however, and this was mainly due to the radio signals being broadcast over open air, instead of by wire, like a telephone system.

Once again, that was something we were working on - something more than telegraph wires.

Fort Barned Commspony: C> "Fort Barned Relay, go for Alpha Actual."

K: C> "One-way message. Destination, Royal Palace. Massive enemy fortification located at Rose Ranch, near Fort Dodger. We have sufficient force to overcome the enemy, this is an advisory only. How copy, Fort Barned?"

Fort Barned Comspony: C> "Read you four by five. One-way message, destination, Royal Palace. Massive enemy fortification located at Rose Ranch near Fort Dodger. We have sufficient force to overcome the enemy, this is an adivsiory only. Confirm message, Alpha Actual?"

K: C> "Confirmed, Fort Barned. Alpha Actual, out." I nodded at the comms unit. "Well, that'll be that."

Now, we just needed to wait for the reinforcements.


TIME: 19:07

The 9th Artillery rolled up to the area by the train, and unlimbered their guns to load up. The train tracks were well within range of the Rose Ranch, we just needed to advance the train about ten kliometers.

Capt. Hammerstrike: "9th Artillery, reporting as ordered, General." He nodded to me, then to Major Wagoner. "Major."

Maj. Wagoner: "Good show, Captain. You got here a bit early." He patted his shoulder.

K: "Indeed. Once the guns are loaded on the train's cargo cars, have the ponies rest - we already arranged for the town to cater our little camping expedition, but there's not enough rooms in the town to give everyone a bunk, so get the tents out. Major Cosmic Plane, here, is going to direct the guns personally." I nodded to him.

Cosmic: "I'm the General Staff's artillery expert." He nodded to Hammerstrike.

Capt. Hammerstrike: "Yes, Major." He nodded smartly. "As you probably know, we employ the 105mm Heavy Howitzer."

Cosmic: "Yes. Maximum range is about ten and a half kilometers." He nodded. "To ensure we can get the shortest time-to-target and maximum coverage, we're going to deploy no more than 3 kilometers from the edge of the Ranch area." He looked at me. "I'm going to want a Militia detachment to guard the guns."

K: "You'll have it." I nodded back to him.

Maj. Wagoner: "The units from Sequoyah are due in about four hours, sir." He nodded.

K: "Good. Dex?" I looked to him.

Dex: "Yes, K-Dude." He smirked.

K: "Pick the best Militia units out, form a Company if you can, and deploy them defensively around the artillery and the train." I nodded at him.

Dex: "You got it, K-Dude."

K: "Spitfire, Soarin, you're going to be my aerial eyes." I looked at them both. "Stay back, and observe. You see flankers, call for support."

Spitfire: "Yes, General." She gave me a small nod.

K: "Alright then.." I shrugged. "..everyone get some dinner, set out guards, set up tents, then get some rest. When the Sequoyah units get here, get them fed, and get them someplace to bunk down."

Back in my personal train car, of course, Dusty joined me for dinner. We had railroad pie - it's a sort of corn bread casserole with stuff in it. These being ponies, it was made with red and white onions, bell peppers, celery, tomaotes, carrots, and creamed corn. A 'human' version would use ground beef or something. It's then topped with a cornbread mixture with extra creamed corn and cheese. I had a ham steak on the side. Dusty had one, too, but despite her more omnivorous appetite, she still didn't eat as much meat as me.

Dusty: "I've had this before.." She squinted at it. "..yeah, one of the casinos in Las Pegasus has this as a regular buffet item. My mom used to bring it home all the time." She smirked a little.

K: "Mm.. I can imagine it was made with finer ingredients." I was eating it, and I didn't hate it.. I'd have to see if AJ or Granny knew the recipe.

Dusty: "Tomorrow is going to be a real fight.." She trailed off. "..I wish the other girls were here."

K: "I get it." I nodded to her. "You feel better with your Herd. And the girls are your Herd."

Dusty: "Yeah!" She beamed a grin. "Not that I'm not enjoying the time." She shrugged. "But, combat.. yeah." She looked at her food, then me.

K: "And you feel you might not be enough to protect me." I smirked.

Dusty: "You're going to do something stupid." She pursed her lips. "I know you, K."

K: "Maybe I do, maybe I don't have to." I gestured with my fork.

Dusty: "Alright." She sighed. "Expect me to stay glued to you. This is kinda my battlefield - dusty chaparral, the 'out west' type of environment."

K: "I do." I nodded slowly, as I ate.

Part 4: Dusty Chaparral

TIME: 07:02 ERDT
DATE: War Day 706/10 Tertious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: South of Dodger City, Konzas

We had crept the infantry, dismounted, to within 450 meters of the edge of Sir Hitcher Rose's estate. We had with us the Sequoyah 1st Ranger Militia Company of the Tsalagi Tribe, who mustered quickly from Sequoyah City to meet us overnight.

Their leader was Major Stormy Mesa. She was, very clearly, not like the girls or other Equestrian horses. Tying a line to their obvious Native American analogues, they had drab colored coats, and they ALSO had Teddy's head shape! They had more in common with Gen 2 ponies, than any of the ponies with me.

Their dexterity showed this - several were armed with proper war bows, in addition to rifles.

Maj. Mesa: "Funny.. I didn't expect anyone but a Native to look like us.." She said, crawling near me, Teddy, and Dusty.

Teddy: "To be fair, Major, I'm from several thousand years ago. Long story." He shrugged, sighting down his scope. "General, I see hostiles. Duregars, armed with sub-guns. A couple concealed pillboxes with Goblins inside." He nodded.

K: "Major. Can your Braves take the guards without raising the alarm?" I asked, absolutely serious.

Maj. Mesa: "Indeed, General." She nodded.

K: "Do it." I nodded at the sentries.

She vanished in seconds. Everyone was at a halt, but I couldn't tell what her Rangers were doing. I could not tell they were snaking through the grass and shrubbery. Not until the Duregars started dying. Arrows hit heads and necks, and suddenly three ponies appeared out of the grass BEHIND the pill boxes, and slid inside. No noise at all.. not even a whimper.

In ten minutes, it was over, and Major Mesa returned to my side, her face gently streaked with the blood of her enemies.

K: "Outstanding performance, Major." I nodded.

Maj. Mesa: "The way is clear all the way into the compound. He doesn't have any patrols out - no tracks. The nearest observation tower won't spot us until we're in cannon range with the tanks." She reported.

K: "Awesome." I reached out to Dusty for the radio. C> "Alpha Actual to all callsigns - advance, walking pace. Tanks to the front, trucks at the flanks for support, infantry behind." I nodded and stood up. C> "Alpha Actual to Thunder Base."

Cosmic: C> "Thunder Base, go Alpha."

K: "Advance another five hundred meters and dig in. There's some good terrain over to the left of me." I indicated with my Bradley, waving to my left.

Cosmic: C> "Thunder Base, I see it. We'll be emplaced in ten minutes, rounds ready in fifteen."

K: "Roger. Alpha, out." I started walking at a slow pace, to let the tanks catch up. "Ready for this?"

Dusty: "I do rather like the idea that we're not outgunned or out-geared, for once." She smirked, cockily.

The Tassigny tanks caught up with us quickly, and I took my place behind the Flag Tank, grabbing hold of its exterior talk-phone.

K: C> "Danger Darling, this is Alpha. I'm on you." Since this was a Dragoon company, they named all their tanks with a "D" name.

10th Cavalry Commander, Captain Green Gears: C> "Captain Green Gears, General K. I hope we can do as good as we did in training."

K: C> "Just remember your training, and you'll be fine, Captain." I hung up the phone.

Dusty and I stayed behind the tank as we advanced.

We didn't have to wait too long to see action. We were, indeed, in range of the Estate House, but charging up from both flanks were those Duregar APC's, and with them, something new.

It didn't rightly look like any Earthly design. It looked like something almost out of Warhammer, but clearly mass produced, and with a very fittingly cartoonish bent to it. It was wide, squat, and had a short-barreled gun of probably 150mm or larger. Likely very low velocity, and probably more of a howitzer, but that much ordinance would be plenty of hurt.

K: C> "Danger Darling, Enemy Armor ahead. Hold, calling artillery." I grabbed the mic from Dusty. C> "Thunder Base, enemy armor in the open. Range, one triple oh. Direction, three two degrees approximate. Requesting thirty rounds, AP, in Howitzer mode. Make it rain."

Cosmic: C> "Thunder base, copy. Incoming."

K: "INCOMING ARTILLERY! COVER! COVER!" I called out.

Everyone stopped, and the infantry got down. The armor moved a bit ahead, and took position wherever they could get a terrain advantage.. tree, rock, shrub, whatever.

Almost instantly, I could hear shells incoming. I was calling this without a marking shell, so I just got down and observed through binoculars.

The rounds started impacting in a ripple - Cosmic had delayed the gun firings to keep the incoming shells constant instead of in multiple near-simultanious waves. I saw one of the Duregar APC's get hit and detonate. One of the heavy tanks took a shell almost straight down on top of its turret, the shell exploded, and the tank stopped moving. I suspected spall damage killed the crew.

In total, I saw my Artillery handle fifteen enemy armored vehicles. Not bad. I grabbed my mic and keyed up.

K: C> "Dragoons - ADVANCE TO CONTACT!" I nodded. C> "Infantry anti-tank teams, move up! Only engage the Duregar APC's! All other callsigns, fast mount! Prepare to flank!" I nodded to Dusty. "Let's get a ride."

Dusty: "Let's!" She led the way towards the nearest truck, and while she jumped in the back, I grabbed the side and pulled myself up.

I watched as the Dragoons in their Tassingy Medium Tanks advanced forwards and engaged the enemy heavies. The enemy heavies didn't start firing until the Tassignys had fired twice, and knocked out one of the twelve remaining tanks.

There were 12 Tassigny tanks per company, divided into four 3-tank platoons. The platoons held together as they moved to the flank and rear of the enemy heavies, their gun turrets traversing to get a good shot at their aft. I saw three heavies lose their engines, and one detonate completely. One Tassigny was knocked out as it passed by the Heavy, being flipped on its side when hit by its massive shell.

On the flanks, the AT-teams were launching Funston rockets in barrages at the Duregar APC's, and making fast work of them. I saw one AT squad fire on a Heavy for lack of a target, but as I thought, the Funston rocket didn't have the penetration power to get through that tough hide.

If Tirek had more of these, and I imagined he did, I'd have to increase the power of my tanks. It was clear the 76mm gun did not have the ability to outright kill these heavy beasts.

We left the tank battle in the dust as we made for the Estate itself. Up ahead, I could see a lot of hasty barricades, and lots of defenders. We pulled up just outside of their effective range, and the trucks opened up with their roof-mounted 11mm Brownings.

We all jumped out, and started advancing. This was the stage where strategic direction was useless and it was down to squad command. Dusty and Teddy with me, I advanced with 4th squad, 27th Infantry. With the machine guns providing cover, I gestured to fan out, and open fire.

Every few steps, they stopped, took a few shots, and advanced. The enemy was firing back, and I could feel rounds whizz by us. We got within 50 meters, and went to ground.

K: "GRENADE LAUNCHERS!" I pointed at the hasty fortifications. "MACHINE GUNS, CONCENTRATE THERE!" I called out, loudly.

One of the ponies of 4th Squad had a Knox, and loaded in a contact-fuse HE shell. I did the same, and synched up with them, firing at the same time, and letting the shells impact at almost the same area. This blew down part of the barricade, and started a fire.

The Duregars and Goblins saw this, and broke and ran.

K: "ADVANCE! CHARGE!" I called out, and stood up, the first into the fray.

We got through the first line of defenses, and were joined by the rest of the 27th Infantry.

The enemy was scrabling to get into the house, the building itself was stone, and well constructed. About a platoon-sized formation was trapped outside when the doors closed, and were sealed. They were banging on the door to be let in, then turned and started firing on us.

Between precision fire from marksponies like Teddy, and heavy machine gunfire, they were dispatched VERY quickly.

Now, the house itself.

Part 5: Chaparral Slaughter

TIME: 07:40 ERDT
DATE: War Day 706/10 Tertious, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: South of Dodger City, Konzas

The Tassigny tank named "Drop Down" rolled to its position near us, as the infantry and militia got set up to breach the building at multiple points.

We lost two tanks. "Delta Digger" and "Danger Darling." Lieutenant Brusk Bolder was now in charge of the 10th Armored Cavalry, and Captain Green Gears was in the rear getting treated. I lost three tankers killed, the rest of both crews wounded.

In addition, 7 Militia and 12 Infantry were dead, 8 Militia and 3 Infantry were wounded. I had the rest of the 49th Infantry Company, 52nd Motor Infantry Company, and 47 members of the loose Militia Infantry remaining. One of Major Mesa's braves had been injured, but not seriously.

We had destroyed 27 enemy tanks and armored vehicles in direct combat, and killed about 112 enemy soldiers.

Dusty: "K." She nodded and handed me the initial report.

Norfy: "We got off easy." He shrugged.

Gaze: "Aye, suh." A nod.

K: "I still don't like it, you know that. How's Captain Gears?" I was taking fresh Bradley magazines from a crate.

Dr. Allcome: "Oh, he'll be fine. Broken leg. And in THIS world, K, not a death sentence." A small snigger from the doctor.

K: "Eh, well, better than being dead." I shrugged, looking at The Lone Stranger. "How're you faring?"

Lone Stranger: "Troubled. Never kill't no one before." He frowned.

Spitfire: "This is War, Stranger." She patted his shoulder. "These aren't just dastardly outlaws, these are enemy soldiers, and they mean to kill. All we can do is defend our people."

Blackfeather: "It is still killing." He nodded.

Soarin: "I'd rather we just beat them in a pie fight and go home, too, Blackfeather. But, they won't let us." He shrugged.

Chemical Lens: "General." She paced up to me. "Sir Hitcher Rose wishes to discuss terms." She cocked a brow at me. "I will go fetch your duelling irons."

K: "He's NOT!" I looked incredulously at her as she paced away.

Chemical Lens: "He made the challenge, General." And off she went.

Dusty: "He's not serious?" She paced over to Major Mesa, who was returning from the house as well, and our attempts to negotiate surrender.

Major Mesa: "Indeed. General K, he demands a duel. He says that if he should lose, his forces will surrender without incident. If you refuse, they will fight to the death. He claims to have the bulk of two companies of troops in there, all well entrenched. We would suffer many casualties trying to assault the Estate." She handed me a piece of paper, with pretty much exactly that written on it.

K: "Well." I shrugged. "He's serious."

Dr. Allcome: "K.. no one would blame you, if-" He stopped - everyone was looking at him. "-you got injured again." He sighed and checked his medical gear.

Gaze: "Oi. Ye ain't gonna talk K outta this." He shrugged. "S'why we follows 'im. He's willin' tae make a personal sacrifice. Fight Boss ta Boss, 't'pre'tect us."

K: "Yeah." I grabbed the radio. "Make sure everyone's in cover."

Norfy: "Ah. COVER! COVER!" He called out, moving up the line.

Spitfire: "General..?" She trailed off.

K: C> "Alpha to Thunder."

Cosmic: C> "Thunder Actual, go ahead Alpha."

K: C> "Thunder. Enemy is fixed in position. Load with HE and HESH, prepare to fire." I looked at everyone else.

Dusty: "You mean..?" She looked surprised.

K: "This is different from Sidewinder - his troops were in the rocks within sniping range of town. Sir Hitcher Rose is inside a manor house, well away from any civilian targets." I gestured. "Just because I'm willing to duel the big bosses, doesn't mean I hunt for such fights - in this case, I have a better option. Besides, I don't trust him." I smirked.

Dusty: "Well, hot damn!" She grinned, and got to cover.

K: "ATTENTION IN THE HOUSE - YOUR TERMS ARE REJECTED! STEP OUT NOW WITH YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR! SURRENDER IMMEDIATELY, OR BE DESTROYED!" I screamed at the Estate.

Sir Hitcher Rose: "HERE, I THOUGHT THE FAMOUS GENERAL K HAD MORE MORALS AND HONOR THAN THAT! WHAT'S THE MATTER? AFRAID TO DUEL A REAL GUNFIGHTER!?"

K: "YES!" C> "Thunder Actual. BRING the rain! TEN minute continuous salvo! FIRE at will!" I ducked under one of the tanks.

The shells tore the house apart. Explosion after explosion blew chunks of stone and adobe all over the place. We could hear the enemy screaming and dying with each hit. Hitcher was right about one thing - I was scared. Terrified. If Sidewinder hadn't had the bargaining position he did, I never would have duelled him. Hell, almost every one-on-one fight I ever got into, was because I had no other option.

And like the Ponies I commanded, I, too, wanted to return home in one piece.

Artillery shells are cheap. Lives are not.

After the ten minutes was up, there wasn't a house left. Just rubble. Lots of rubble. It was flattened entirely. From two stories with an attic space, to nothing. The 105mm guns did their job splendidly.

K: "Major Mesa!" I called out.

Major Mesa: "Aye, General?"

K: "Get the ponies organized by squad - sweep and clear what's left of them!" I called out again.

Getting up, I dusted myself off, and found Dusty hugging my leg.

Dusty: "Thanks for being smart about this." She sighed. "You had me scared for a second."

K: "I'm brave, not dumb, Dusty." I hugged her back.

After about an hour, Major Mesa dragged Sir Hitcher Rose - miraculously alive, and somewhat injured - over to me, clapped in irons. His clothes were shredded, he was bleeding from a few light wounds, and his right foreleg was clearly broken.

Sir Hitcher Rose: "Seems.. I underestimated you.. General." He lowered his head.

K: "No, you had me exactly right. I am an honorable person, but the idea of a senseless duel when I can just shell your estate into tiny stones.. there's honor, then there's stupidity." I gently grasped his mane and forced him to look at me. "Chem?"

Chemical Lens: "I hereby arrest you in the name of Princess Celestia for the crimes of High Treason, Insurrection, and Sedition." She narrowed her eyes at him. "And murder. Multiple counts. You will answer for each soldier lost here today, as well as the deaths of Mason Jarson's men. Had you not incited Insurrection against Her Majesty, they would not be dead.." She lowerd her head, and looked over at The Lone Stranger. "As for you."

Stranger: "Yeah?" He lifted his head up.

Chemical Lens: "As a Sheriff of Gendarmes, and Gendarmes Advisor to K's General Staff, I would like to offer you a position in our ranks, as Sheriff of Dodger City." She raised her head and nodded gently to him. "If you'll have it."

Stranger: "Uh.. well, sure! I mean, I can certainly help keep the peace.." He looked over at Blackfeather. "Only if my blood brother comes with."

Chemical Lens: "Oh, indeed. I shall, of course, make it a requirement that you're not to be transferred.. and Blackfeather is to stay with you.. at all times." She gave Blackfeather a small grin.

Sir Hitcher Rose: "And this is why I told Scorpan this plan would never work." He shook his head. "Sooner or later, a champion would arise, and take me out. But.." He shrugged slightly. "..he told me his technology would take care of that. Seems he was quite wrong."

K: "I'd call that a confession." I made a face of disappointment. "Hitcher.. you'll swing for this."

Sir Hitcher Rose: "Indeed, I will." He sighed. "And now, I have a feeling that's what would have happened, no matter what." He looked down and away. "If you'd never come. That the Lone Stranger would have beaten me.. I really was a fool."

K: "Dusty, take the prisoner away to Fort Dodger, make a report, and prepare to get underway. We have to get to Paris." I shrugged a bit.

Yes.. twenty four days to the ceremony commemorating the beginning of the war. At least, though.. we had victories to show for it.
