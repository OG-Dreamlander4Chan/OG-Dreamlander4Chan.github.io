DATE: 28 Noneus 1001, C.S.


One year since I've arrived in Equestria. One. Year.

In that time, I've managed to fall in love, start an army, seduce two goddesses, create an arms industry, gain friends, help friends, and...

...I still have no idea how to get home.

But, that's alright. I know, now, my purpose. I know why I'm here. I awoke that morning very early, with a sense of dread about me. In the barn, behind Applejack's house. I stared up at the ceiling of the barn, thinking.

Tirek.

I'm here because of him.

I know that, now. That existential dread, that reason why I had not been sent back once I arrived. It was him.

Why, though?

Discord said he decided to bring me here to cause chaos.

But, he refused to send me back home when I had him on the brink of death. I could have killed him, had Celestia not arrived and stopped me.

He didn't send me back.

Why?

Was his ultimate goal something... ENTIRELY different? Chaos, yes, but on whom? Was he on Tirek's side? If he was, he did something really stupid by letting me stay here. My knowledge of Tirek was.. I knew all about him, from Generation 1. THAT cartoon, I'd watched religiously as a kid. The adventures were so.. compelling. Sure, the throwaway episodes were crap, but the really good ones..

..what if the Chaos he wanted, also meant causing Tirek chaos? That he wanted me to be an Equal Opportunity Chaos Creator? Disrupt everything and everyone?

That might be the case. I was already doing that. Steelhoof.. I'd forced him to take a life. Granted, it was an animal, but it was still a life. He'd be forever changed - knowing he killed to protect someone (so he thought), and he was now training the Royal Guards with the same lessons I'd taught him, practicing each fundamental skill over and over, until they could think and react as a coherent force, once the danger was brought to their hooves.

Equestria would never be the same, because I had created an army, an army of trained soldiers, that understood not just violence in a cartoonish sense, but real violence. Blood. Death. THAT would be a huge culture shift.

And Chaos.

Tirek.. what was his angle?

Ahhhh... probably wants to rule the world or something. Typical Bad Guy stuff. There might be another goal in there, but conquest was very likely on his list, or kneecapping the Elements of Harmony wasn't something he'd try right away. Trixie had said she needed the jewelry intact, the wielders prisoner. He had a goal, something.. he needed the jewels.

If he just wanted destruction, he would have gone for the throat, and attacked the largest population target available with destructive magic, or his Shadow Powers. No.. he was trying to take out the only defensive pillar Equestria had.. HE didn't KNOW that I even EXISTED until Lone Hoof Ridge.

Yes, he's after conquest. And he would have wiped the girls out if I hadn't been here to arm them with firearms.

That.. that wouldn't have been Chaotic at all, would it? No, no, it wouldn't have.

Starting a war? Ohhh... yes, yes, THAT would bring Chaos. That meant that.. Discord had some way of knowing Tirek would be coming around when he stole me. He couldn't send me back, because if he did, Tirek would walk all over everyone without a problem. Me remaining here would create Chaos, as it would allow Equestria to RESIST Tirek, using MY weapons..

Applejack: "What'cha thinkin' 'bout, honeybun?" She said, appearing in my vision, as I still stared straight up.

K: "How did you know I was thinking?" I smiled.

Applejack: "Y'all got'cher serious face on." She smiled warmly, and slid her head under the covers. "An' I'm 'bout to wipe it clean off."

I was only in my boxers. She fished out the worm, and proceeded to engulf it, soft as it was, and start sucking. My hands went from behind my back, to gripping the sides of the bed as the shock of her expert oral skills reached my brain.

Fuck Tirek, and fuck Discord, I'm about to fuck my girl.

I relaxed and let her do it at her pace. A smile formed across my lips.. a big, happy smile. I caressed her mane as she sucked and slurped my hardening shaft. She knew JUST how to make me blow.. her moans, her lewd sounds.. before I knew it, my eyes were rolling to the back of my head, and my body stiffened, as I shot my load into her warm, eager mouth, and she swallowed every drop.

She slid up immediately, knowing she had a short window to get an immediate second shot out of me, and slid my shaft into her inviting hole. She was going to milk me, she was doing all the work.. it was usually 50/50, but.. whatever, I let her. I stared into her eyes as she rode me with determination, my man meat staying firm, partly out of mental arousal, partly out of the sensation of her horse puss gliding over it.

She got off quickly. Me? I took a few minutes. And since I wasn't the one taking the lead, this went faster than it usually did. Her whole GOAL was to just get me off, hard, and fast. After she managed to make me fire off another shot (and after about her third orgasm), she slumped against me. And we just laid together.

So comfortable.

It was noon before we got out of bed. Hunger, more than anything, drove us from the comfort of the carefully packed hay-and-linen mattress and light covers. I went to the shower stall that had been installed in the barn, and when Applejack looked like she was going to head to the house, I grabbed her by the tail and dragged her into the stall with me.

K: "Gotta scrub the pony good after you ride 'em.." I smirked into her ear.

Applejack: "Mmm. 'Cept, ah'm tha' one who done the ridin'.." She drizzled back.

K: "Still." I got the warm water on, and started scrubbing her down.

It was far more about tender lewdness than it was getting clean.

Once we were cleaned off, though, I got dressed and she headed off to the house for a moment, coming back.. also dressed. Denim back half pants, green short sleeve shirt, and her father's hat.

I should point out that, at this point in our relationship, she considers the act of wearing clothes like this, to be a massive flirt. She sauntered up to me, now fully dressed myself in black cotton duck pants, an A-Frame, and a black button-down shirt, and rubbed against me.

Applejack: "Y'all been here a full year, now.." She leaned up and kissed me.

K: "You're wearing a belt." I pointed out.

Applejack: "Only 'cuz I ec'spect y'all'll be pullin' it off'n me.. later." She nuzzled me.

K: "Mm? What's this? Something planned?" I kissed her snout.

Pinkie Pie: "DIJA TELL HIM?!" She exploded into the barn, bouncing around, in circles, then pouncing me in a big, friendly hug. "Happy One Year Being Trapped In Equestria Thanks To Extra Spooky Magic Day, K!"

K: "AHAHA!" I hugged her back. "Ohhh.. Pinkie.. let me guess?"

Pinkie: "PARTY!!!" She squealed.

K: "I though-WHOA!" She yanked me, and I was suddenly being led to The Party Barn, as we now called it.

Everyone was there. Well, except Luna - it's daytime.

K: "Holy mackerel!" I blinked.

Twilight: "We.. well.." She stepped forwards. "..we know things haven't been easy on you." She shrugged. "We wanted you to know.. that we really care." She smiled.

Spike: "YEAH!" He ran up and hugged me. "You're one of the best things that's ever happened to me!"

Fluttershy: "I'm.. glad I found you.." She paced forwards, and I gave her a headpats. "Mmm.. you're such a good friend, K."

Rainbow Dash: "Yeah, no kidding!" She popped me a bro hoof.. "Hey, you and your guns saved my best friends.. what can I say?" She grinned.

K: "You played a big part in that, too, Dash." I nodded, pointing a finger at her.

Rarity: "And, darling, you've been a wonderful billboard." She.. kinda sauntered over a bit, but kept it more friendly than anything, and patted my face. "It's not every day that a fashionista like myself can say that someone wears exclusively her designs, every day, around here."

K: "Yeah.. well.." I shrugged. "..naked hairless monkeys aren't a pretty sight."

Applejack: "Hm. Speak fer yerself, thar, shugah.." She slipped up under my arm.. a bit protectively.

Octavia: "K." She came up and nodded to me. "I never really did thank you for.. well.. you helped me and Vy realize we're not so different, after all." She was.. far more formal than Rarity.

Redheart: "Yes!" She came up and gave me a friendly hug. "You're such a good friend, K. I can't tell you how much Sweetheart and I appreciate it when you have time to help out around the hospital." She shook her head. "When you're not being treated yourself, that is."

Sweetheart: "Mm-hmm!" She chimed in, with a nod.

Pinkie: "Sooooo... to thank you for everything you've done.." She trailed off a bit.

Celestia: "..we decided to throw you a party." She stepped up, and nodded to me. "K. Thank you. For everything." And gave me a very Mommy-like nuzzle.

K: "I appreciate it, Your Highness." I patted the side of her snout. "This world has given me a real purpose. I mean, I wouldn't be doing things like this.." I trailed off a moment. "..back in my old world."

It was getting to be like that, wasn't it? Was this becoming my home? Was my 'old world' just that - a previous life, and this is my new one? I didn't rightly know, but I wouldn't do this place the dishonor of calling it NOT my home.

Celestia: "Well. Since you're so different, and we've learned so much about.. some of the negative things of your world.. we wanted to make certain you understood. That we value you." She nodded slightly. "Also, I've been hearing something about you not really.. drawing pay?" She cocked a brow.

K: "Yes, ma'am." I nodded.

Celestia: "I want you to know that I trust you with the Nation's purse. I'm.." She looked at Rarity. "..certain you won't simply buy ten wardrobes worth of clothes with it."

Rarity gave her the cutest pouty defensive look, like, 'Would I do that?'

K: "Ahh.. well.." I shrugged.

Celestia: "You need to take care of yourself, too, you know." She nodded. "Take Applejack out some time. Go.. crazy. Have fun." She nodded. "And for goodness sakes, get something for yourself, for once."

K: "I.. have clothes. And food. And a job, a.. beautiful mare. I don't really need much else." I shrugged.

Having been dirt-fucking-poor taught me what I did and did not actually need, in life. Luxury goods? Bah! No sense in 'em, not when I have the basics and, mostly, someone to care for.

Celestia: "I insist." She nodded sagely. "Which reminds me! We got you something."

K: "Aww.. c'mon! You shouldn't have!" I was blushing.

Besides a giant cake, of course, there was a present for me. I opened it up, and inside was a new set of leather belt gear - a better sheath for my large hunting knife, a holster for my gun, and a pouch for my multi-tool, as well as a small tool pouch for miscellaneous things. It color-matched the black leather belt Rarity had made for me.

Which explains why she didn't charge me for it.

The other thing in there.. was a watch. This was the most precious thing. Unlike Ponies, I wore a wrist watch. Most of them used pocket watches if they felt a need for one. This was an open-face pocket watch attached to a leather bracer. Or, in Human terms, a replication of the first styles of wrist watch. Given that Ponies are about 3/4ths the scale of a human, the watch face was smaller than a standard Human pocket watch, and the bracer thin-ish.. meaning it looked, on me, like a "large" wrist watch.

I was tearing up a bit as I put it on.

K: "Watches have always been special to me." I said with a sniffle. "I've always had a.. certain paranoia about time. Lost time. Missing time. So, I've always had a watch. I didn't know what I was going to do when this watch ran out of juice. Now, though.." I wound it up a bit, just to check the spring and gear tension. "..not only do I have something to tell the time, I have a precious gift from the people I care about the most."

I was hugged.. by just about all of them.

One year. One. Year. In. Equestria.

And I was ready for many, many more.
