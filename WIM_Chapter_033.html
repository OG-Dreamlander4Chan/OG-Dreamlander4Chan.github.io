Part 1: Shipping Fee

TIME: 09:22
DATE: War Day 294 (Local)
Location: Moligan Island

We were assembled on the island with the Moligans. We'd have to wait a few days while enough coal was brought up and processed for us to fill the Moonlight and Alarm. That and the Moligans wanted to see me. We hadn't had much luck in communicating with other races - after all, every other race we'd met so far that had any appreciable numbers was.. interested in killing us.

Luna and I had a very long talk about what I knew. Very long. Twilight and Cadence were both part of the discussion. We covered everything that was on our plate.

K: "Eventually, the truth IS going to come out. And I'm not just talking about history, I'm talking about science." I looked at Twilight.

Twilight: "Yeah.." It was rather disturbing to think that her Goddess didn't actually raise the sun. Not like we thought.

K: "Look.." *Sigh* "..just because she has nothing to do with the rotation of the planet doesn't mean she isn't important. The ceremony itself is important to Equestrians.. just like Hearth's Warming Eve (which I'd merged with Christmas over a year ago) and all that. Ceremony and belief.. faith.. is its own magic." I shrugged.

Luna: "I agree." She gave me an apologetic look. "Are you thinking about how to improve Equestria after the war?"

K: "We need to clear some things up, or we may never get back to the level of technology that the Lost Kingdom had. And it's not just the tech itself, it's the theories and sciences behind it that are important. We could be so much more effective if we had things like surface search radar, gunnery radar, guided missiles.. aircraft that weren't pure dirigibles.." I shook my head. "..and Air Force that wasn't almost purely restricted to Pegasus Ponies and what an individual Pegasus can carry. But there's a line in the sand here.. a line where culture has to be taken into consideration. I'm not sure how that part is going to work.." I took a drink of water. "..but it's important that science be seen as something universally acceptable, or we end up with fringe ponies like Chemical Splash that are one of a few that can actually understand it. I know Ponies are rather.. selective.. in their talents, by their very nature, but you've seen firsthand what cross-training can do. Before the war, Mac didn't know what a gun was. Now? He's the designated armorer for his team. Ponies CAN learn things outside of their Cutie Mark-endowed powers, and I want Equestria - all of North Equus - to be a civilization that's educated, openminded, accepting, and innovative." A pause. "Think of all the things we could accomplish. Like the Barriers - Tirek wants a way through them, and all we have to go on are old, fragmented legends. We don't even have any equipment that can analyze it without a Unicorn around to imbue it with magical emergy. Or huge-ass batteries that are scarcely reliable under the best of conditions."

Luna: "You bring up a good point, My Love." She patted my shoulder. "Which brings up your other theories."

Twilight: "Yes! The whole 'made to forget' thing that you were discussing before Chowsin Ridge." She shrugged a little. "I have no idea if your theory holds any truth to it. It might.." She dug out something from her saddle bags. "..have something to do with the Empire of Harmony which all of the modern North Equus nations came from. This is a transcribed history book that was produced from some fragmented journals and things. Princess Yuuki had it." She opened it up and (magically) flipped the pages with great care. "It says here that the Empire of Harmony was a magical place where all ponies lived without a care in the world.."

K: "You can read Neighponese? Since when?" I cocked a brow.

Twilight: "Since Princess Yuuki started teaching me?" She smiled. Ah, the little learner.

Cadence: "Go on, Twi." She patted her on the back.

Twilight: "Anyway.. the book says that the Empire of Harmony had.. something.. in it that kept Ponies lighthearted and carefree. Something that enhanced positive feelings, and chased away negative ones."

K: "Awful strange that the bonds of friendship started to deteriorate, then, isn't it?"

Luna: "We still don't have any answers to that mystery. Discord's theory that Chaos was the reason.. didn't exactly pan out." She looked away, and I idly pet her astral mane in reassurance.

Twilight: "It may have something to do with the apocalypse that Cadence explained." She shrugged. "According to the book, though, when disharmony started to happen, the ancestors of Neighpon simply left. There's something in here about them battling demons, but I think it's a metaphor."

K: "Possibly. Japanese.. NEIGHponese.. writings are usually good at obfuscated meanings." I stated. "That's probably what happened to the Kiangese, too. They're all equines.. but only the Neighponese are the same type of Equine as us. The Khyang are wild asses." A shrug, here.

Cadence: "Alright. Now, what is your plan for our return to Equestria?"

K: "Simple. I had Spike burn off the false intel last night. It says we're returning as soon as possible, that someone important in the party is injured, and we took heavy casualties in Neighpon, so to be prepared to send reinforcements. I also had him explain that we didn't want to say 'who' in order to avoid a panic. It took us 21 days to get here. I want to shave that to 18." I shrugged. "Once we arrive in Baleston, I'm gathering every Militia between Baleston and Ponyville and marching on the capital. I fully expect Chrysalis to call her Changeling Horde the second she's discovered - we'll need a lot of troops to counter them. I'm not going to try sneakiness - but the fight being inside the capital means we can't use artillery. This will be purely an infantry action. I also want Paratroopers dropped into the town as we approach, to take key objectives and evacuate civilians."

Luna: "How.. tough are these changelings?"

K: "They're living weapons. They can fight hand-to-hand and cast magic bolts from their horns if they have enough energy. They can also exactly duplicate a person's appearance, but that's very draining. For this reason, I want everyone fighting in pairs. Pairs stay close to each other. Fortunately, a good magic zap is enough to cast them out of their disguise, so if there's any suspicion, we may have to zap our own people. I don't believe they're as good as Shadows, but.." I shrugged. "..we will have to see."

Cadence: "..what about My Love?" She looked down at her water cup, on the table.

K: "I don't know. I would think she's keeping him alive while she waits for the right moment to strike. If he died for some reason, there would be a lot of unanswered questions - which would blow her cover. My coming here, my developing the military like I did, probably scared her. If she swallows the bait of my intel, she might think my arrival a good thing - that it will drain the military resources around Canterlot, and give her the opening she's been seeking."

Luna: "It makes sense." She shrugged.

Twilight: "No kidding." She gave a grin. "Cheer up, Cadence.. we'll see my brother again."

Cadence: "You're not sore at me for falling in love with him, are you?"

Twilight: "You know, the war has taught me that there's a lot more important things to worry about, than that." She hugged her. "At least if I'm going to have a sister, I'm glad it's you."

I remembered Twilight was supposed to be offended about this arrangement.. maybe.. I HAD done something positive here, after all.


TIME: 14:33


I went to the Moligan Village with Forest Spirit and Blinda. I did say they wanted to see me. A leader had arisen among the ones that decided a civilized life with us, was better than scraping around under the ground. He wasn't a Starnose, though. He was a Digger. Named, appropriately enough, Pik Ax (yes, that's how he spelled it).

We had constructed a number of houses and a school here, to give them a real village to live in. Once a leader emerged from the group, we made a special house for him that included a meeting area. Ambrosia was already here, along with Senshi. The other Bushin were busy leading smaller operations throughout the Reinyuku Islands.

I never did get a chance to explain how Stridesebo went down, did I? Well, we managed to take all of our objectives, the part of town where I set off the A-bomb 'safely' was being cordoned off and would be buried under ten feet of dirt, and we managed to capture a small group of ships - two Ships-of-the-Line and two Sloops - for the Neighponese Navy. Given our emergency situation, I assigned the Bushin to find the Prison (we didn't know exactly where it was) and liberate it on their own, if they could. I would leave a significant portion of the Marines behind to help them, led by Gunny Sigmask.

Anyway, Pik Ax was in the meeting hall, with a few other Diggers. I gave him a short bow as I entered.

K: "Mister Pik Ax, I was told you wanted to see me." I said as I entered.

Pik Ax: "I do! We do. We want to know about things." He started. "You give us this.. why? We hurt you. We did things to you. But you give us chances we should not have."

K: "That's because we believe in forgiveness. What happened was regrettable, but no one died. It was a cultural issue. Where I come from, nations that have fought brutal wars against each other, have become best of friends. I want that to happen here. That's why I've seen to it that you have a degree of autonomy, the ability to select your own leaders, and taken your advice on the best places to dig. We want to be friends."

Pik Ax: "Makes sense, it does!" He chortled. "Okay. I do have things I want to ask for. Small things."

K: "Please." I nodded. "Any reasonable request."

Pik Ax: "We want to.." He paused, looking for words, but summoned his child over to hand him something. He then haded it to me - it was a 5-Bit Coin. "..a Marine gave this to my son. He said to spend wisely. We want to have things to spend!"

K: "I get it, you want to be paid. Real money." I nodded again. "Alright. As soon as I can arrange shipping back and forth between other lands, I will see about getting you paid. And getting Merchants to come here, so you can actually spend it on something."

Pik Ax: "That makes me happy! Thank you!"

K: "Anything else?"

Pik Ax: "Yes! One last thing. We want to be smart like you, too. You gave us a school, but we want more smart things to learn."

I admit that their 'education' was rudimentary at best. They were SMART creatures, but they had no way to LEARN.

K: "Easily arranged. When I come back, I will come back with more teachers - professors, people that can educate the Moligans as well as Ponies. We see you as our equals, and I do want us to have the same basis of education as well."

Pik Ax: "See? You good friend." He patted me heartily on the shoulder. "One small last thing!"

K: "Okay, what is it?"

Pik Ax: "We want to hold our special festivals, and make our special fesival brews - is this okay?"

K: "Sounds fine to me." I looked at Ambrosia.

Ambrosia: "It's some kind of strong alcohol that's.. fizzy. Strangest stuff I've ever seen, but they make it entirely from plants."

K: "Go for it." I shrugged. "Is that everything?"

Pik Ax: "Yep! Thank you."

And with that, I departed the Meeting Hall with Ambrosia.

K: "So, what's it like being the Military Commander of the Island?"

Ambrosia: "It feels like I want to give the job to someone else." She chuckled. "But, I manage."

K: "I'll bring back someone from Equestria to handle things here on a permanent basis."

Ambrosia: "Going back? So soon?" She questioned.

K: "It's top secret, but yes. I need you to stay here, though. I'm sorry."

Ambrosia: "Okay, but be careful. I do worry about you - you're my friend, too." She smiled and headed off to her "Foreman's Office" near the mines, and I to the ships.


TIME: 12:22
DATE: War Day 295 (Local)


I was embarked on HMS Alarm. On board with me, besides Luna and Starlight Mint, was Dr. Allcome, (promoted to) Colonel Forest Spirit, Twilight Sparkle, Toola Roola, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Rarity, (promoted to) Captain Tankette Blinda, Majors Norfy Loconsole, Cosmic Plane and Lidless Gaze, Big Mac, Gilda, and Nurse Redheart. Everyone was paired up for the coming battle. I'd be with Applejack, of course. Strangely, Pinkie (her 'normal' self, if you can call that normal) wanted to be paired with Toola Roola - who didn't object.

I was in the rear cabin area of Alarm, when Pinkie came to see me.

K: "Pinkie! What can I do for you?" She had a smile on her face.

Pinkie: "I wanted to talk.." She got up into my lap. "..but you have to promise to keep it a SEEEECRET." A lighthearted peck on the cheek. "Don't worry - I'm not gonna rape ya!"

She didn't. And I won't reveal what she said to me in the cabin, either. You'll understand better once I explain everything, later.

Her coming to me in the cabin, though, had far-reaching consequences.

The last part of the conversation, though..

Pinkie: "So, really, I don't think we're going to have a problem with Chrysalis. But I'm pretty sure someone is going to die. I just don't know who." She shrugged, still sitting on my lap, being all affectionate.

K: "You don't let this bother you, do you?" I asked, with concern.

Pinkie: "Never! How do you think I stay so happy? If I let every little thing bother me, why, I'd just never have any time to party!" She giggled.

K: "I.. hope whomever it is, doesn't suffer." She was predicting the death of someone - it could mean anything. When Fluttershy was raped by Grogar, her prediction related to the death of Bray, at the hands of Norfy.

Were we going to end up killing Chrysalis? I wouldn't be too offended if we did - the Hive wasn't something that could really be negotiated with. They wanted love, like vampires want blood, and they were nearly feral, to boot. Chrysalis? We might be able to talk her down - she was intelligent and sentient. But if her need for 'love' to feed her brood was too excessive?

I was just sorry I didn't have a really, really large can of RAID.

Part 2: Night Strike

TIME: 04:22 Equestria Royal Daylight Time
DATE: War Day 314/13 Secundus, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Baleston, Maresechusetts

K: "EVERYONE, FULL FIELD PACKS! DRAW WEAPONS AND AMMO!" We weren't even to the dock yet.

HMS Moonlight was almost a full day behind us, too. We'd made excellent time. I could see the dock from here, and thanks to the use of signal lights, they should be calling out the Militia as we approach. We'd be marching to Canterlot, which would take 12 hours. Along the way, we'd pick up the Baltimare Militia, and the Paddock County Militia. I'd send word to Manehattan as soon as we got on shore, so they could Turn Out and meet us at Ponyville.

What I didn't expect to see was Derpy and Dr. Whooves at the dock. And Derpy had a flat stomach.

Tankette: "Isn't that.. Captain Derpy?" She asked.

K: "It sure is." I had to grin. When had she given birth? For that matter, who told her we'd be here?

Alarm slid into the dock, and actually rammed the far side (we couldn't cool the engines fast enough for a slow stop). I ignored it - the ships would have to be heavily modified anyway.

K: "GANGPLANK DOWN! CREW - TURN OUT AS NAVAL INFANTRY! SEA SWIRL, DEEP BLUE, GET YOUR PONIES TOGETHER!" I ran for the edge of the ship, and, given that it wasn't that far down, I simply used the anchor chain to get down to the dock. "Derpy! Doc!" I ran over to them, keeping my Bradley at my shoulder.

Derpy: "K!" She hugged me. "Her name is Dinky-Doo. I just gave birth about ten hours ago. Dr. Well Wishes cleared me for duty."

Dr. Whooves: "General.." A pat on the back, and a chocolate carrot in my mouth. "If you really want a cigar, come to the Club on Wednesday." He murmured in my ear. I always SUSPECTED the Doctors had a little 'contraband' on hand.

K: "Ten hours and you're clear for duty?" I blinked.

Derpy: "If you'll have me." She dug her front right hoof into the dock a little.

K: "DASH, GET ME AN EXTRA BRADLEY AND BANDOLIER!" I shouted up to her.

Dash: "ON IT!" She had her head over the side. "DERPY!" She squee'd. "HEY, EVERYONE! DERPY'S BACK ON THE TEAM!" she shouted, getting everything ready.

A large stallion about Mac's size, with almond-cream coat and tan mane stepped up to me from the docks, wearing a Militia Commander's rank and uniform.

Major Duncan Deep: "Major Duncan Deep, Baleston Militia." He saluted, I saluted. "What do ya need of us, General?"

K: "All four Infantry Companies, and your Ranger Companies." I stated. "Keep the Cavalry and the Artillery here. Full field packs, full ammo loads, two days rations. We march on Canterlot - an impostor has taken the place of Princess Cadence, and intends to use a large force of creatures known as Changelings to invade our home. They FEED on LOVE, Major, like vampires."

Major Deep: "Yes, sir!" No question. And off he went.

K: "Captain Derpy, can you fly back to Ponyville and Turn Out the Town Militia along the way? I don't want to stop and gather forces at every town."

Derpy: "You got it!" Pony Revere, right here, folks.

As the girls got down from Alarm, and Derpy accepted her equipment from Dash, she passed hugs all around, and came back to me.

Derpy: "What should I say?"

K: "That the Changelings are coming." I was sort of kidding.

But, off she went. A flutter to get airborne, and she zoomed away.

Dash: "Everyone's getting assembled, K."

K: "Good. Have the crew tie off Alarm before we leave."

Dash: "Roger that."

The Baleston Militia's four Infantry Companies turned out in less than twenty minutes. Of course, it helped that local militia were ordered to keep their service weapon safely stored in their homes, with full ammunition loads - just like Minutemen. I even designed the Equestrian Local Militia Command's insignia to look like a.. well, a pony with a tricorn, holding a Sherman, in shilouette. Hey, I love my county, don't fault me.

Major Duncan: "TYPHOON! COME HERE!" Duncan was in the lead - the Baleston Militia were still using Shermans, but they had Ridgway SMG's.

I saw a bluish-minty pony trot up. He nodded to me.

Lt. Surge: "Lieutenant Typhoon Surge, Baleston Militia Rangers." A casual salute. "I'd introduce our Captain, but she's down with the flu. Normally, I'm Commander of 2nd Company, sir." He had a touch of an Ambleion accent.

K: "Ambleionian?"

Lt. Surge: "Born and raised, suh. Settled here as a filly, though, with mah folks."

Gaze: "Gut'a see anotha Ambler, mate." He came up behind me.

K: "They're down a man, Gaze. Get a spare radio set and join them." I gave him a sideways glance. "He'll be your temporary S-i-C. He's not a Ranger, but he does alright." I mussed Gaze's hair a little.

Gaze: "Oi, suh!" He whisked it back in place. "Roi't!" And off he trotted.

K: "Surge, I want your Rangers as forward scouts. Depart immediately, we'll be leaving in ten minutes. Head straight to Canterlot by express train, maximum speed, and once you get to the outskirts, disembark and set up a Command Post, then send the train back. Once you arrive, start evacuating all civilians towards Manehattan in your A-O. Don't leave your A-O once you start setting up."

Lt. Surge: "Right, suh." He nodded and off he went. "RANGERS! GET YOUR FLANKS IN GEAR! WE'RE GOING!"

Gaze came up next, with the radio mic in his mouth.

Gaze: "Ish Aero Dart, shir." He said, with the mic in his teeth.

I took it.

K: C> "Alpha Leader Actual, go ahead."

Vice Colonel Aero Dart: C> "Alpha Leader, this is Cloudsdale Air Force Base. You called, sir?"

K: "Cloudsdale AFB, your callsign is Blue Thunder. Copy?"

V/C Aero Dart: C> "Blue Thunder copies."

K: "Blue Thunder, listen closely. I want you to manually go and wake up every flyer, every paratrooper, and QUIETLY prepare for immediate action. Target - Canterlot. I will need Combat Air Patrol and Close Air Support with Strafing Only. Paras are to prepare to jump in seventeen hours. DO NOT inform the Palace or any other commands. Besides Alpha Leader, Selene Actual, or Alpha Command, you are under orders not to inform anyone of these preparations. Cancel all leave, all ponies back on base. Make it look like a spur-of-the-moment training excercise. Do you read me? Over."

V/C Aero Dart: "Blue Thunder acknowledges. Communications Black-Out. Prepare for C-A-P and C-A-S, Strafing Only. Paras prepare for jump at twenty-one-thirty. Over."

K: "Perfect, Blue Thunder. Alpha Leader Out." I handed the mic back.

Ten minutes later, we were on our way.

We would use the rail system part of the way, but the final approach to Canterlot would be on foot/hoof. Along the way, we would stop to pick up other militia units as needed. I couldn't warn the Royal Army directly, since the Royal Army had most of its command staff at the Palace.

I knew we couldn't use trains the whole way. To say nothing of the space needed, what if Chrysalis caught wind of what was happening? We'd be sitting ducks if her Changelings decided to strafe a troop train.

Improving the rail and road system was now a priority.

Before we headed out, I had an emergency messenger from Alarm fly to Fillydelphia and drop off the finalized plans for the ships. They had already halted construction on them once, to prepare for Ironclad conversion. I was jumping the technological ladder to the 1890s - HMS Celestia would be completed as a Pre-Dreadnaught Battleship.

Ninety minutes in, we stopped at Springfield, and we were joined by the Hartford Regiment of the Cobneticut State Militia, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Haber Dasher. Four more Infantry Companies, two more Ranger Companies. Plus, weapons and ammo resupply, fresh off the production lines at Springfield Arsenal.

LCOL Haber Dasher: "General K!" He trotted up. His militia still had Zhukovs. "Hartford Regiment, Cobneticut State Milita reporting for duty."

K: "Load up, Colonel." I looked at his tabs. "And make it fast - we can't delay things too long."

LCOL Haber Dasher: "Of course, General." He bowed his head to Luna. "Your Royal Highness."

And off HE went.

We would stop at Princesstown (Kingston) and march the rest of the way to Canterlot, stopping in Ponyville. Princesstown to Ponyville was about 30 kilometers, and about the same to Canterlot - a total of over twleve hours' march.

When we arrived in Princesstown, Clement and the Manehattan Regiment's infantry and Ranger companies were waiting for us.
Originally raised only as the Cavalry component of the Capital District Militia, I'd had Manehattan raise the rest of the Companies to be a full-strength Regiment before I left. Seems Clement was selected as the commander. Valencio was nowhere to be seen - I assumed he took over as the Cavalry Commander.

K: "Commander Orange."

Applejack: "Uncle!" She trotted forward enough to give him a hug, which he returned before giving me a casual salute.

Clement: "General K. Manehattan Militia reporting for duty." Another four Infantry Companies, and two more Ranger companies.

K: "Get in line behind Cobneticut." I instructed. "We'll rest briefly once we reach Ponyville. Baltimare, and Paddock County should have arrived ahead of us."

Clement: "Roger that." And his unit fell in line as we passed them.

We made better time to Ponyville than I'd hoped - nine hours, ten minutes. Six hours marching, two and half hours by train to Princesstown. And we still had a seven hour march ahead.


TIME: 13:40 Equestria Royal Time
LOCATION: Ponyville Militia Headquarters


I walked into the barn, not stopping as I ordered the troops to rest. The town turned out to feed and water them. The entire militia was assembled in the side fields - as I predicted, Paddock County, Baltimare and Detrot were there already. Colonel Golden Harvest met me in the barn.

K: "Harv, send someone to AJ's and get me my duffel bag, please?" I asked as I finally sat down. *Groan* "I've never marched like that before." About 30 kilometers at an average pace of just over 6 kilometers-per-hour.

Harv: "Right. Script?" She nodded to him. "And someone get the General some tea!" She yelled out, and I saw Rose take off. "How bad is it? Derpy came flying into my house yelling 'The Changelings are coming! The Changelings are coming!' Told me to Turn Out the town militia and took off."

K: "Very bad. Get the other commanders in here, we're having a quick briefing, then we're marching on Canterlot." I said as Princess Cadence came in. "The Changelings.. replaced her."

Harv: "HOLY HAY BALES!" She exclaimed, and rushed out to get the other militia commanders.

Cadence: "I still need a gun, you know." Yeah, we hadn't had enough rifles on the ship for everyone. I had to save space somewhere - Alarm is barely a Corvette in modern terms, she shouldn't have been able to make the trip she did, at the speeds she did.

K: "Draw one from the stocks over there." I nodded. "You're an Alicorn - Rarity showed you how to use the Super Sherman, we should have a few."

Cadence: "Thank you, but I'd prefer a Chaffee." She went over and grabbed one, popping the magazine in expertly.

K: "Get me a Merrill, please." I pointed to the rack of Machine Guns.

Cadence: "Coming up." She grabbed one and brought it over to me. I set my Bradley and magazines down on the planning table. "Hon, take my Bradley."

Applejack: "Mah stomach's all in knots.." She said, taking my carbine. "..ain't mah first dance, but still.. this's diff'ernt."

K: "You're defending your home, Applejack." I shrugged, tiredly. "I'm not surprised this has you nervous. If we fail, Equestria will fall to Chrysalis, and Tirek will conquer whatever's left."

Cadence: "We will be fine." She placed ammo belt sacks next to me.

Constructed of heavy canvas, the ammo belt sacks for the Merrill and Abrams Machine Guns each held 100 rounds of ammunition. That was about the limit of what a Pony could carry in their arms. Fifty round sacks were more common. I simply attached three around my belt rig, and fed a fourth into the gun itself. I wanted the extra firepower.

Written Script came in with my Duffel. I rooted through it and came up with Colonel Williams' M-19 and Ka-Bar. I hadn't grabbed a handgun in all this time since I was rescued, so, I put the M-19 on, and loaded in the cartridges. The speed loaders went into their little leather pouches, on the right hand side of my chest rig. Knife on the left, over the shoulder.

Harv came back in with the other commanders.

Harv: "Here they are."

K: "Ladies and gentlecolts.. let me explain our enemy."

Part 3: Attack on Canterlot (Operation: Infested Wind)

TIME: 20:44 Equestria Royal Daylight Time
DATE: War Day 314
LOCATION: Outskirts of Canterlot

K: "Signal Aero Dart to start the Paratrooper Operation." I ordered, checking the belt on the Merrill.

Cosmic: "Blue Thunder, Blue Thunder, this is Alpha Command - Begin Operation: Infested Wind!" He stated into the radio.

K: "Alright, Militias, you have your sectors of town to secure - GO! Before she gets wise to this!" I ordered. "SPIKE!"

Spike: "Right here."

K: "Message. Burn it!" I ordered.

Spike: "Right."

The message was burnt off to Princess Celestia. It read simply 'LEAVE CASTLE NOW - GO TO JOE'S ALONE - BURN THIS MESSAGE ~ LUNA' I hoped Chrysalis didn't intercept it, but that was a chance I had to take.

K: "COMMAND TEAM! ON ME!" They assembled. "Forest Spirit, you take our left flank. Start getting people evacuated. Go!" I nodded. He was partnered with Redheart. "Blinda! You and Doc Allcome are with me, AJ, Twilight, Rarity, Luna and Cadence. Norfy! Your team, right flank. We head straight for Joe's, then to the Castle."

Norfy: "Aye!"

Tankette: "Aye-aye, SIR!" She puffed up, and checked her Bradley.

K: "Alright, by the numbers, let's move. Lieutenant Ty -"

Lt. Typhoon Surge: "Aye?"

K: "Follow up behind us with the Baleston Rangers. One company. One company stays here at the Command Post to help the evacuation."

Lt. Typhoon Surge: "Rog'ah!"

And into the town we went. Moving quickly, checking our corners and sectors, quietly pepperpotting through the streets. No opposition. We got to Joe's within ten minutes. As I expected, Celestia was there, in her bathrobe, trying to dry off with a towel that Joe's son, Mac, brought to her.

Celestia: "My General, would you mind explaining what's going on!?" She demanded.

K: "Changelings." I stated, simply, as I let Cadence enter (in full combat gear).

Cadence: "Auntie Celestia, I've been a prisoner of Tirek's for two years." She started.

Celestia looked aghast. Terrified.

K: "Princess Celestia..?"

Celestia: "Dear.. ME.." She shook her head. "I-" She looked at Twilight. "Your brother fell terribly ill about two weeks ago - what I thought was Cadence has been tending to him day and night."

Cadence: "OHHH! My Love.. please hold on.." She quivered, momentarily.

Twilight: "Shining.." She looked away, gritting her teeth.

K: "You didn't know..?"

Celestia: "I'm powerful, not omnipotent." She reminded me.

K: "I also know everything she knows, but we'll talk about that later. I wouldn't be here to save your royal sun-butt if I didn't care and trust you implicitly, Celestia."

Celestia: *Darkly* "I need a weapon." She took off her forehoof shoes, and set them on the table.

K: "WEAPON!" I ordered back up the line. I was handed an Abrams Machine Gun and its belts, which I gave to Celestia as she pulled off her tiara. "Sure you can stay awake for this?"

Celestia: "Yes." She stated, angrily. "I will not tolerate invaders in MY Palace." *Short sniff* "It was already bombed into ruins once."

K: "Come on." I looked at Mac and his brother. "Give me a Cruller and then get the hell out of here." I placed a bit on the counter, which Mac refused, but handed me the Cruller anyway.

Mac: "Don't have to tell us twice. We loved our dad, but we ain't endin' up like him! Come on, Bro!" He pulled a Sagebrush from under the counter, and his brother a Custer, and off they took.

K: "Let's move. Chrysalis is probably suspicious by now."

We DID manage to get as far as the next block, though.

Luna: "Does anyone hear.. buzzing?"

K: "COSMIC, CALL FOR C-A-P, NOW! EVERYONE, FAN OUT!"

The green bolts started hitting the ground all around us almost instantly. I rolled over on my back and fired into the sky at any dark little dots I could see. She figured it out. But we had forces in place already - I had no idea who was at what objectives, but we were farther into this thing than I thought we'd get before she caught on.

Cosmic: "THIS IS ALPHA COMMAND! WE NEED FIGHTER COVER! LOCATION - FIVE BLOCKS SOUTH-SOUTH-EAST OF TOWN SQUARE! OVER!" He looked up. "THREE MINUTES!"

K: "RIGHT! DON'T LET THEM LAND!" I fired a burst at a low-flying Changeling, caught it in the chest, and sent it to the ground.

Celestia: "GET OUT OF OUR KINGDOM!" She fired off an immense fireball into the sky, that separated into twelve 'bug-seeking' fire bolts. Each one found its mark, and splattered their targets. Celestia the Mobile AA Platform!

Luna charged herself up, and accessed what she could of her Nightmare Power, achieving her Nightmare form. Instead of fire, she shot laser bolts into the sky from her horn, and single shots from her Bradley.

K: "MOVE! DON'T GET PINNED DOWN!" I urged as we advanced.

Cadence: "YOU HEARD HIM!" She cut loose with her Chaffee, blasting parts of bugs off, everywhere.

We started moving just as our Fighter Cover arrived.

K: "HOLD FIRE! FRIENDLIES IN THE SKIES!" I ordered as we ran for Town Square.

Gunfire was sporadic, but it was all over town. I could see Civilians running for the edge of town. The trains were out of the question - they'd be a mass casualty event on wheels if the Bugs bombed them.

Speaking of?

Then a building exploded next to the fountain, and sent fragments into the street below.

K: "EYES! EYES! WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!"

Tankette: "I DON'T BELIEVE IT! THOSE CHANGELINGS HAVE BOMBS!"

K: "FUCK!" Chrysalis either stole from us, or made a deal with Tirek. "KEEP MOVING!" There wasn't much else we could do.

The Palace was six blocks away. Ahead was a squad of Royal Guards, furiously firing into the skies. I started running for them, just as I heard a shell screech. Instinctively, I flattend myself to the ground. The bomb hit about ten meters from their position - three wounded, the other three got up, and started dragging their comrades away.

K: "GIVE. THEM. COVER FIRE!" I ordered, turning my Merrill to the skies. I fired off most of the rest of my belt at Changelings that were starting to zip in all over the place.

As I predicted, we wouldn't be able to completely keep them off the ground. I didn't predict them to have access to weapons. They started landing ahead of us, just as I was snapping the new belt to the end of the old.

Tankette: "GENERAL!" She pushed me down and fired over my head, dropping the bugs.

Applejack: "ON TH'A LEFT!" She took cover behind a cart, and engaged the ones I hadn't seen, coming up on the left of us.

Celestia: "Get down!" Her voice has a way of carrying. She fired off a wave of flames, incinerating the bugs that Applejack was shooting at.

I got up and hip-fired into the ranks of bugs that had landed ahead of us, covering the guardsmen as Dr. Allcome ran over to them. Blinda shot out from around my side and got over to cover him.

K: "We don't have time to stop. Blinda!" I nodded to her. "Stay with the Guards!"

And we moved up. Towards the palace, which was already a war zone. Scorch marks were everywhere. Guards were down all over the place. Some were injured, others were dead. And not dead in the normal sense - they looked deflated. Almost like they'd had everything sucked out of them. The Unicorn victims were the worst off.

K: "It looks like the Brood is feeding.." I theorized.

Twilight: "This is horrible!" She nudged. "Come on!"

Applejack: "Jes' hold your horses, Twilight. We rush in there, we could end up lah'k them! Le's do this by th' numbers."

K: "We're no good to anyone dead. Come on." Merrill up, I moved in. "HOLD FIRE! BLUE TEAM! BLUE TEAM!"

Lieutenant of the Guard Ironhide: "OVER HERE, GENERAL! WE'RE PINNED DOWN!" Yep, Ironhide. Promoted since I reorganized the Royal Guard. "WE HAVE WOUNDED!" He sounded a bit panicked.

K: "Move in! Sweep and clear!" I swung around the corner and opened up on a gaggle of bugs feasting on one of the guards.

Forest Spirit: "GENERAL!" He came up behind me with the Left and Right flank teams, plus Blinda and Dr. Allcome.

K: "Elements, Princesses, on ME." I nodded to Blinda. "Get to Ironhide, reinforce him. Take two more with you."

Blinda: "Aye-Aye!" She grabbed two ponies from Baleston and moved to give Ironhide cover, firing a grenade - "GRENADE!" - and splattering a pile of bugs.

The girls and I made our way to the royal chambers. Toola Roola was with us, too.

K: "You doing alright, Toola?"

Toola: "Yeah. This is trippy." She had a Ridgway SMG. She seemed to favor sub-guns.

K: "GRUNDLE!" He was a guest here. He should be in one of these..

Celestia: "That room, over there."

We rushed for the room, right as several bugs smashed through the windows. Rarity, Twilight and Cadence put them down, allowing us to simply run past them. Celestia's Abrams was simply floating at her side. As we got to the corner, she floated it around the bend, and summoned an orb from her horn. This floated around the bend as well, and the Abrams fired off several bursts. She then nodded.

Celestia: "That way is clear."

K: "Grundle's room. AJ, Pinkie, Flutters, Toola, Stack Up." I directed and let Pinkie take the lead (she was the only one with a shotgun).

Pinkie: "BREACHING!" She mule-kicked the door open and we rushed inside.

K: "CLEAR LEFT!"

AJ: "CLEAR RIGHT!"

Fluttershy: "Casualty!" She simply stated. And we moved over to where she was.

Fluttershy stepped back to reveal Grundle had been stabbed in the back with a large knife. He wasn't moving. I rolled him on his side.. dead. His eyes were still a little open, so I shut them.

K: "And thus dies the Grundle race.. rest in peace, my friend." I stood up. "Cadence's room. Go!" Chrysalis probably did this. To shut him up. I pushed the thought from my mind.

Celestia took over as lead, while I moved up. She fired her levitated Abrams at three more bugs as we made our way up the last hall to where Cadence's quarters were. When we turned the corner, though...

Celestia: "OH!" She scooted back around the corner, and a hail of green bolts hit the far wall. "There's so many of them!"

K: "Right. AJ? Flutters? Dash? Grenades."

AJ: "Raight!"

They leaned around the corner at three different elevations and fired grenades up the hall, letting them burst on the bugs, and making one gigantic mess.

K: "RUSH THEM!" I ordered, taking the lead, and completely dumping my entire belt down the hallway. There WERE 'so many' of them. At least a hundred, all packed into one space. I took the far right wall, sliding against it and firing. My belt ran nearly dry, so I yanked it out of its pouch, and fastened the next one to the end, and resumed firing. To my immediate left was Luna and Cadence - Luna was just using magic, Cadence was blasting bitch-bugs with her Chaffee. I saw her reload and switched fire to cover her.

Progess up the hall could be measured in inches - they were so thick, and with corpses that still twitched, we ended up hosing down dead ones just as often as live ones. We finally managed to breach through the lines of bugs, and get to the door.

K: "STACK UP! PREPARE TO BREACH!" I got in line first.

Cadence: "READY!"

Twilight: "Ready!"

Luna: "Ready!"

Celestia: "Ready, my General."

K: "Right. BREACHING!" I kicked the door as hard as I could, and rushed into the room, the rest of the girls behind me.

There was Chrysalis - seated at what should have been Cadence's nice mirror-topped dresser/desk. Shining Armor was in her lap, with her head bent over him. She looked up at us as we entered, weapons drawn and at the ready.

Chrysalis: "..oops! No more love.." *Mad cackle* She dropped him to the ground, from her lap.

Shining Armor was dead. Stone dead. His eyes were tiny periods, lids locked open, his whole body stiff but shrunken. Shrivelled. Drained of all his life and essence.

Cadence: *SHRIEK!* "MY BELOVED!! NOO!!"

Twilight: "SHINING!! OHHH..!" *Sob*

Chrysalis: "Seems you're too late, Human. How does it feel to fail?"

I looked at her, my mouth feeling like it was wired shut as I ground my teeth together in pure incomprehensible rage.

K: "Like you're going to die, just like the rest of your broodlings.." I raised the Merrill, leveling it at her torso.

Chrysalis: "Silly human.. I'm MUCH tougher tha-"

*FFFFFWWWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMM*

One instant, I was ready to pull the trigger. The next instant, Chrysalis was on the ground, smoldering.

Cadence: "YOU.. YOU.." She stalked over to her, her horn still glowing. "YOU KILLED MY BELOVED!" She raised the Chaffee in her hands. "YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL THAT!!"

*BATCHOOM!* She blew off her horn.

*BATCHOOM!* Her left foreleg.

*BATCHOOM!* And her right rear leg.

Twilight pounded forwards, and took the Chaffee from Cadence.

Twilight: "HE WAS MY BROTHER!" She screeched.

*BATCHOOM!* Right foreleg.

*BATCHOOM!* Left rear leg.

Celestia: "Twilight! Cadence! Calm down!" She urged.

Cadence: "NO! SHE TOOK EVERYTHING FROM US! SHE WILL PAY!" She screamed.

Chrysalis, for her sake, didn't look like she could do much of anything right now. She was oozing green blood from her stumps.. her head was oozing, too, from her dismembered horn.

K: "Do it.. and you'll be just like me, you two. Killing for revenge is one of the worst things anyone can ever do." I shook my heaad. "Don't.. don't become a monster.. like me." I looked at Toola.

Twilight: "..BUT!" She raised the shotgun, putting it at Chrysalis' head. "WE CAN'T LET HER LIVE!!"

I passed my Merrill to Toola, walked over, and put my hand on the Chaffee's barrel, lowering it.

K: "Don't become like me, Twilight. Please. I care about you too much to see you throw away your innocence for revenge, like this. Shining wouldn't want that, either." I looked up at Cadence. "You too, my Neice.."

They both backed off. Twilight lowered her head, and sniffled.

Chrysalis: "Weak... eh.. little ponies.." She sneered.

'For hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee.'

K: "Let ME do it FOR you!" Out came the M-19, and I emptied the cylinder into Chrysalis' head.

Thus endeth the reign of the Changelings.. and Shining Armor's life.

{End of Part 3}


Part 4: Broken Heart

TIME: 09:27 Equestria Royal Time
DATE: War Day 321/20 Secundus, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Ponyville, K's Barn

Twilight hadn't said much to any of us after it was all over. The fight had been short, and hard. Fifty two ponies died in Canterlot, and the bombing Changelings managed to wreck a lot of the newer construction. Twice, our capital had been attacked. And the second time around, we weren't helpless.

Cadence, after everything was said and done, and the bug bodies were removed from the palace, locked herself in a bedroom and wouldn't eat until the funeral was over. Shining Armor had been laid to rest in a cemetary near the castle. She was devastated. She hadn't spoken to anyone. Twilight? She went right to her girls - even Toola - and cried on their shoulders. Not that she didn't offer to take Cadence in as part of the mourning, Cadence just didn't want any part of it.

Even I felt horrible. I'd failed someone that was vitally important to the future of Equestria and the Crystal Kingdom. Or, I felt like I had. Celestia reminded me that I wasn't omnipotent, either. That I was capable of making mistakes. Well, be that as it may, not stopping this sooner was something I felt like I was to blame for. Even if Chrysalis HAD put me under some kind of spell, it was still.. something I felt guilty for.

I had Applejack to cry on. Cry WITH. She barely knew him, but still - she counted Twilight like family, and this was a lost family member to her.

I was sitting at my desk, having put the death behind me (I have a long and depressing history with death, it doesn't hurt me as much as it does others, any longer). I was working on the next major technological leap for our military - armored vehicles. Winona was curled up at my side, and Applebloom had passed out on my old cot.

Big Mac: "Brother.." He came in with coffee and a sandwich. "You okay?"

K: "I'll be fine." I shrugged. "I'm thinking of leaving Twilight and the girls here and going back to Neighpon as soon as possible. They still need our help taking their land back, establishing factories.. things like that. Plus, I promised the Moligans I'd help them, too."

Big Mac: "Mhm." He sat next to my chair. "Don't take all the world's problems on your own shoulders, Brother. You're in charge - delegate. You told me that, once."

K: "I sure did." *Sigh* "Alright. You're right. I'll do that." A one-arm hug. *Chortle* "How did we get to be so close? Way back when, you wanted to kill me."

Big Mac: "I just wann'a see my sister happy. You make her happy. Back then.. well.. I thought you'd hurt her." He shrugged. "Now I know better."

K: "I guess so." I took a sip of coffee. "Just one thing after another with us, isn't it?"

Big Mac: "Eyup." He chewed idly on a piece of wheat. "You ought'a go see Twilight. You know.. let'er know you're thinkin' about her."

K: "Great idea." I got up, and stretched. "I've been hunched over that thing for too long, anyway." I grabbed my shirt, checked the Morgan on my hip, and headed out.

Twilight was in her library. Spike was there, too - he wasn't taking this very well, either, but right now? When I entered the library, I found him sitting on the ground, looking at a book, with deep bags under his eyes.

K: "Spike, you look exhausted." I commented.

Spike: "Mmmh.." *YAWN* "..I am. But Twilight wants this book checked."

K: *Concern* "For what?"

Spike: "Some way to bring him back. She swears he.." He looked up at me. "..is it weird to want to bring someone back from the dead?"

K: "..no." *Sigh* "Basement?"

Spike: "Basement."

And so, into the basement I went. I found her at the very back - in the Reading Nook - with lanterns all around her, while she read from three books at once. She looked worse than Spike - like she hadn't slept in three days. Her hair was frazzled and barely held in place by a band around her head. Her eyes had bags under them. Hell, her cheeks looked sunken in.

K: "Twilight.." I started, as I approached.

Twilight: "..and if Rhodenpony's theory is accurate.."

K: "TWILIGHT SPARKLE!" I shouted.

Twilight: "..oh! K! I didn't see you there." Yep, her usual 'lost totally in obsessive thought' thing.

K: "Twilight." I walked over to her and forced the levitated books down. I closed them. I grabbed her by her forelegs and lifted her up. "He isn't coming back. None of them are." It was hard for me to say - harder than you might think - but it had to be said. That was her thought process, after all..

Twilight: *Sniffle* "It's not FAIR! IT'S NOT FAIR! TRIXIE GOT TO COME BACK! WHY NOT SHINING ARMOR!? WHY NOT MY BROTHER!? WHY?! WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN!?" She started wailing immediately.

All I could do was hug her tightly, take her over to her couch, and sit her down. And hold her. I let her cry on my shoulder until she fell asleep. Then, I just laid there, with her on my chest, sleeping. She slept for hours. Sooner or later, I ended up nodding off, too.

I really shouldn't have been surprised. These are Ponies. They feel emotions like we do, but magnified - some times by a lot. Twilight going to the only thing she knows - magic - and trying to find a 'solution' to the 'problem' is exactly what I should have expected out of her.


TIME: 07:22
DATE: War Day 322


I woke up when Applejack came and put a blanket over us and curled up next to me, on the couch. But went back to sleep soon after. We finally all got up around seven, and went to Rose's Cafe for breakfast.

K: "You're going to Rarity's after this for a beauty treatment." I stated.

Twilight: "I-I don't.. look so bad.."

Applejack: "Twilight, yew look like y'all got run over by a herd'a cows!" She snickered.

K: "Eat. You haven't eaten in days." I prodded her.

Not that she needed much help. Twilight ate a whole pizza to herself.

Twilight: "I just.." She shook her head. "..isn't right.." She finally murmured out.

K: "I know it isn't. But it's.. just the way things are. Besides, if my theory is right, you won't be so upset.. probably sooner rather than later." I shrugged.

Twilight: "What do you mean?" She tilted her head, looking at me quizzically.

K: "That theory I brought up about.. how ponies around here seem to forget the painful memories, and just move on." I looked at Applejack.

Applejack: "Huh? Oh.. oh, right." She nodded, having to be reminded of it.

Twilight: "That.. maybe.." She shrugged. "It's an interesting theory. It might have something to do with that book I showed you."

K: "How fateful that you become your own test subject for it." I patted her shoulder.

Twilight: "Yeah.." *Sigh* "..be sure to observe me, okay?"

K: "Promise."

Toola Roola came around at this time. She sat right down next to me, and adjusted her new art bag.

Toola: "So, the Royal Card you gave me, to get whatever I wanted?" She handed it back to me. "I hope you know, I spent B1,200."

K: "Worth it." I shrugged. "Get everything you wanted?"

Toola: "Oh, yeah. I want to start painting as soon as possible." She looked at Twilight. "Would you be offended if I painted your brother?"

Twilight: "Not at all. Maybe future generations can remember him like I did. Brave. Tough." *Sniff* "A big brother.."

Applejack: "C'mon, Girl. Let's go git you prettied up!" Always the helper, my dear love. I gave her a grin.


TIME: 12:33 ERT
LOCATION: Caterlot Royal Palace


I had to get a lift here, from Twilight's balloon and Gilda and Dash to drive it. Because the train schedule was still disorganized from the attack. Gilda and Dash decided they wanted to go help with the recovery and clean-up anyway. As for me? I had to see Celestia.

K: "Your Highness." I nodded as I entered her study. The same one we did the nasty in, all those two years ago.

Celestia: "My General." She nodded, looking out the window.

K: "I have a very important question that absolutely cannot leave this room." I started, walking over next to her and sitting in a chair.

Celestia: "Ask me anything." She shrugged a little. "You've already shown me more trust and.." She looked down and away for a moment. "..you could have killed me, at one time, but not only have you not, you've supported me besides my faults. You can ask me anything."

K: "You're.. still.. not fully grown, are you?" I asked, trying to think of the right words.

Celestia: "Accurate. My sister and I are not as powerful as our mother. It will probably take us another ten thousand years to get that far.. mind you, the two of us were born only a few years apart, but we will have our size differences until we.. fully transcend our mortality. We CAN be killed, yet cannot die of old age. And if we're not killed properly, we regenerate." She left the hint that I probably could have done it 'properly.'

K: "That's what I thought. Now, let me ask you about The Wishing Star.." I started.

Celestia: "I.. know.." She lowered her head, rubbing the sides of her face with her fetlocks. "..I have vague memories of something like that."

K: "Supposedly, it could grant a single small wish to everyone, on Christmas. Or, what it was called back then. I'm talking Ancient Ponyville. I'm not sure exactly where it would fit on the timeline, though."

Celestia: "You're wondering if it might have the power to wish someone back from the dead." She shrugged.

K: "Yes, but I didn't want to get anyone's hopes up." I stated, speaking with my hands. "Least of all, Cadence and Twilight, if this turns out to be a bust."

Celestia: "And you call yourself a monster." She put her wing around my shoulders. "You're willing to take something that might have the power to get you back home, and you'd use it to bring back Shining Armor?"

K: "Of course. I mean, we've lost so many friends so far in this war. I couldn't possibly gather enough magic to resurrect them all. But Shining Armor? Maybe. He's important - he's one half of the Power of Love. And we may need his and Cadence's power to defeat Tirek - bringing him back from the dead might save hundreds of lives." I folded my hands in my lap.

Celestia: "You're no monster, K. You're a true friend. Actually.." She looked at me. "..you do, I must admit, have the parental qualities important in being a leader."

K: "You're not flirting with me again, are you?" I smirked a little.

Celestia: "Mm.. no. Just stating. You're a good father - you're the sort of person willing to put others, ones you seek to protect, before yourself. Your needs and desires. That's not the attitude of a monster, that's the attutide of a leader. And a good one." She leaned her head in. "It's the qualities I'd look for in a mate, too, but it's rather hard to go dating and find someone willing to 'adopt' several millions of 'children' - that is, if the dating pool wasn't populated by one human who's already spoken for." She gave me a wink.

K: "You would have snatched me up, wouldn't you?" I chuckled.

Celestia: "If you were an Alicorn." She reminded. "Not that I have any problem with you being human - but I do want actual children of my own, one day. As it is, we had a.. satisfying few minutes together and we're now close friends."

K: "Mmm. That's more than enough for me - it's not every day that a Mortal can count two Goddesses as friends."

Celestia: "We're not omnipotent. Not yet." She reminded. "Mother was. So was father."

K: "Did you ever meet him?" I asked.

Celestia: "Once.. when I was very young. The memory has stayed with me. As did my memory of meeting you as a filly."

K: "What was he like?"

Celestia: "Mm.. powerful. Warm. Sure. Real. Solid. In ways that mean more than those mere words."

K: "I understand.. somewhat. I-I get what you're saying, but I can't feel it. You get me?"

Celestia: "As is often the problem, but, yes."

K: "What can you tell me about The Wishing Star?" I said, getting back to the main issue.

Celestia: "Well.. if it's anywhere, it would be where the Lost Civilization came from before they resettled this area. That would be in the far north, past the Crystal Kingdom."

K: "That.. that version of Ponyville was there, wasn't it?"

Celestia: "I believe so. Though the Empire of Harmony was primarily located here, in Dream Valley. The original Ponyville was founded as part of the Empire's northern lands. It's where the three prime races were, before they moved here and.. all the problems started." She nodded. "That, I'm sure of. But everything else is very fuzzy. At the time this all took place, Luna and I were here in Dream Valley, so whatever I'm remembering probably came from.. something someone else said, or something I read, but when I think about it, I recall the detail as being very important for me to recall."

K: "What's it like, going through your Renewal?"

Celestia: "Incredibly draining. Before we start it, we have to collect our important memories and actively think about them, or we lose them. And there's only so much we can think of. But, as we get older, we can remember more. Once we start the process, we can't stop it. From the outside, it looks as though I'm burning up, and Luna is becoming one with the moonlight. Our old bodies burn away, and we are.. reborn? Reformed? Whatever you'd call it - we come back as ponies. The apparent age has, of course, increased as time has gone on. We then grow up to adulthood - more slowly than a normal pony of course - and remain in our prime until our time grows short again, and we begin to age. We can choose to go through Renewal at any time, once we reach physical adulthood, or we do so automatically if our bodies are too heavily damaged. As in, we aren't killed properly."

K: "When was the last time you went through a Renewal?"

Celestia: "Let's just say it's been a while. Before that nastiness a thousand years ago. And as Luna stated herself, she's been through a Renewal recently. It's the other reason we don't look close in age. Physically, she's younger than I am."

K: "When will you need a Renewal next?"

Celestia: "I'd say.. no more than five hundred years. But I would like to do it much sooner, it's less taxing. That's one of the reasons.."

K: "Twilight Sparkle. You want her to get to your level - or close enough to it to take over while you're Renewed, with Luna's help?"

Celestia: "Exactly. You're a smart one, you are.." She chuckled a little. "She has great potential. I have a feeling that if she pushes herself - properly, of course - that she can achieve Alicorn-hood. From there.. who knows?"

K: "What about Cadence?"

Celestia: "She's my emergency back-up Princess, I guess you could say. If something were to happen to me and Luna, she could take over for us as long as things remained peaceful. She's neither as experienced, nor as powerful as we are. She's also mortal. But, if we both had to renew say.. in the next twenty years due to injury, she could take over until we were both physically old enough to resume our duties. Though she herself would be quite old by then, her magic would be more than enough to sustain her. Especially if we helped. But I would prefer Twilight to be ready."

K: "Any reason?"

Celestia: "You are right in that I do want Ponies to start taking over for their own affairs. To be honest, I would rather my sister and I be more.. there for guidance. I do not wish to be the one deciding everything for them - though they are like my own children, all children do eventually grow up. And your.. seemingly radical ideas of governance and technology may just help me in my goal."

K: "Oh?"

Celestia: "You could single-handedly bring pony technology back to where it was in the later stages of the Empire of Harmony. Technology, boosted by your ideas, breeding thoughts and theories. Science and new discoveries. Or, re-discoveries. Your mind is very fertile, and it could sow the seeds of a very interesting future. And you know the pitfalls to avoid along the way."

K: "In short, I could guide them part of the way, and let them go the rest of it on their own."

Celestia: "Exactly. Which reminds me.. I have a question of my own."

K: "Anything, Princess."

Celestia: "If it turns out that you.. share, in some way, our immortality.. how would you deal with it?"

K: "I suppose I'll just deal with it. I mean, I'm already prepared to lose Applejack and everyone in this war. It could happen. And then there's the risk that one of our enemies may try to harm me indirectly by killing Starlight - it's what I'd do if I had no scruples - so, I'm prepared to face that. Not that it wouldn't crush me. Plus, I would have you two. I suppose I could stand an eternity of fucking two beautiful Goddesses until you two reach Omnipotence. Perhaps at that stage, the three of us could explore the galaxy together? There's always something new to discover.."

Celestia: "Hm.. you take that concept better than I thought you would. But, what if we were chained to this planet until it's death?"

K: "If Equus is as old as Earth, and the rough dimensions of the solar systems are the same, that won't happen for about four billion years or more. But when it does, the sun will expand until it consumes the earth. Sadly, the moon will go first, but by that time, temperatures on the surface of the planet will scour away all life. Am I prepared to sit on the last piece of rock in a sea of lava, with you, until the sun consumes us? Sure, why not? It wouldn't be the worst way to go." I hugged her, tightly. "If that is my fate, I would gladly choose to die at your side. Even if I could somehow escape - unless I was desperately needed - I would die at your side, as you - the sun - consumes us. See, in my Faith, my God promised not to flood the Earth again as a way of cleansing it. It's.. suggested.. that he would do so by fire, if it were needed. And as it turns out, that's exactly what our sun will do in four billion years. Granted, in about one billion years, all life on the planet will be extinct due to solar heating boiling away the water and atmosphere. Except, perhaps, us. So, dying in the blaze of the sun.. would be an ironically religious way for me to die. Given that I hardly practice my Faith."

Celestia: "I'm impressed." She nodded. "But, I'd not want you to spend three billion or so years on a lifeless rock.."

K: "Not entirely lifeless. Theoretically, we both would still be alive, and so would Luna. This assuming we can't escape. It's all theoretical, anyway. Actually, Discord might still be alive.. he's supposed to have practical immortality, too, and can apparently only be 'actively' killed. As in, by deliberate action."

Celestia: "True. Perhaps three billion years alone with us would put him in a better mood." She giggled.

K: "As I said, all theoretical." I nodded. "You have nothing else about The Star?"

Celestia: "I'd say go and check the libraries, but I think the only one that might have anything on it would be the one in the Crystal Kingdom's capital city. Which.."

K: "..we can only get if we liberate them, which requires the Crystal Heart, which requires the Power of Love, which requires Shining Armor. Catch-22. The impossible conundrum."

Cadence: "..not exactly, Uncle.." She came up behind us.

K: "GAH!" I about jumped out of my chair - though Celestia's (very strong) wing held me down.

Celestia: "Don't worry, I didn't realize she was there, either." She giggled. "As I said, not omnipotent." She turned to Cadence. "What do you mean, my dear?"

Cadence: "My love for my people.. may be enough." She came up on the other side of me, and hugged me. "And the love I have for my friends and family. The Power of Love is not restricted to romantic love." She gave me a squeeze. "I decided that My Beloved would not want me to shed any more tears for him, and do whatever I can to restore my people."

K: *Long sigh* "Then we go after Sombra." I nodded. "We take him out, and we see what we can do from there."

Cadence: "If My Beloved is.. returned.. then my power will grow much stronger. If it is magic that is needed to defeat Tirek, the Power of Love may be an important part of that equation." She reminded us.

K: "Totally agree. And as I mentioned to your aunt, bringing him back may prevent more deaths. But, say nothing to anyone about this, please. I don't want to get anyone's hopes up if this turns out to be a false lead."

Cadence: "I promise, Uncle." She sat, looking at the sky.

So, now we would be off to the Crystal Kingdom? Interesting. I wondered, then, if Sombra was as allergic to high-velocity lead poisoning as everything else we'd encountered.

Part 5: Who mourns the forgotten?

TIME: 09:33
DATE: War Day 325/24 Secundus, 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Ponyville, Militia Fields


I had some people over from the Militia units that helped out with the Canterlot battle. At the moment, I was showing off the new sniper rifle and heavy machine gun that Equestria had adopted for NEIGHTO StanAg III - the Hathcock ER-4 and Browning EM-4, which went into serial production after I'd left for Neighpon. The first few hundreds of these were being distributed to militia units - though the first 50 Brownings off the assembly line had been sent to key fixed locations around Equestria, such as Canterlot, the Fillydelphia Naval Yards, and the Baleston Naval Yard.

Part of the reason for this was to adjust tactics and strategy - there would now be dedicated Heavy Weapons units embedded with Infantry and Cavalry formations. Rangers, by their nature, wouldn't use heavy machine guns or have dedicated Heavy Weapon teams, but they would use the Sniper Rifle. Paras wouldn't even use that - they were getting a DMR variant of the Bradley, now that Buff & Lamb had perfected the manufacture of shock-resistant scopes for combat use.

K: "..and the Browning would be fit into each Heavy Weapons unit as described on your hand-outs." I nodded. "Now, who wants first crack at this?"

Lt. Typhoon Surge: "I'd'nt mind it, suh." He raised a hoof.

K: "Alright, L'ef'tenant. Let's see what you've got." I pronounced it the Ambelion way. LEF-tenant, instead of LEW-tenant.

Typhoon got behind the HMG, and I showed him how to operate the crank on the right side, to chamber a round.

K: "Now note that you have to crank it twice when it's first being loaded, so the round seats in the chamber." I noted.

Lt. Typhoon Surge: "Rog'ah." He said with a nod.

K: "You'll want to lean into it a bit. This thing has a kick, and even with the Traverse-and-Elevation mechanism and the heavy tripod, it will try to jump around on you. So, put one foreleg here, and have the other on the handle." I adjusted him. "And put your weight here." More adjustments. "Now.. pull the lever."

*CHOOM!-CHOO-CHOO-CHOO-CHOO-CHOO-CHOO-CHOO-CHOO-CHOOM!*

Ten rounds. I gave him a pat on the back, and pointed at the pine boards we were using for targets. Or, well, what was left of them. They were all cut down, splintered messes. The backstop - a thik earthen berm - was pockmarked with impacts. We'd been shooting at 50 meters, and the pine boards were all three inches thick (75mm). The Brownings had a cyclic rate of fire of 600 rounds-per-minute, or 10 rounds per second. They fired the 11x66mm round - Equestria's equivalent to the mighty .50 BMG.

K: "Excellent!" I nodded.

Major Duncan Deep: "That's qu'hite a weapons system, General!" Balestonian accent. "Most impressive!"

K: "Alright, everyone, get some trigger time on these things. There's enough weapons to go around, and BE SAFE with them. Just because the lot of you are officers, doesn't mean you're indestructible or incapable of mistakes." I nodded. "Mac?"

Big Mac: "I got 'em, brother." He patted me on the shoulder, and took over as Range Safety.

Me? I walked over to where Dr. Allcome was. I'd brought him and Nurse Sweetheart with me - Redheart was on a date with Forest Spirit - in case one of these chucklefucks managed to mangle themselves somehow. Hey - I was STILL used to thinking these were people. Thus, very capable of doing something stupid.

Dr. Allcome: "Everyone's in a tizzy over Shining Armor.." He said, with a note of sadness.

K: "I know. It's.. a big deal. He was going to be Prince of the Crystal Kingdom, and he was Commander of the Royal Guard. It's not easy when you lose someone that high ranked and important - that famous." I shrugged.

Dr. Allcome: "Yet no one really knows the REAL tragedy." He noted.

K: "Yeah. Grundle." I rubbed the back of my neck. "He was a good man. Good Grundle.." And shook my head. "With him gone, his race is extinct. A sentient species has gone extinct in the modern age."

Dr. Allcome: "I.. don't suppose anything like this has happened to you." He shrugged. "You mentioned that only humans are sentient where you come from. So.."

K: "Oh, I get the gravity of the situation. It's tragic. Horrible. But we have the benefit of your interviews with him. And recordings of his voice. It may not be perfect, but it's a lot better than nothing. A lot better than them having gone extinct without anyone knowing about them. And now? You can publish those interviews - the recordings - and tell everyone the truth about Grundles. At least he knew much of his own history. And his personal stories? Ponies will connect with him. Know him. Maybe not as well as you, but they will come to know him on a personal level. Then, there's the drawings we have of him - animated, they can be used to tell his story, visually." I shrugged.

Dr. Allcome: "You're.. right. I have to tell the world about Grundle. That way, if - thanks to your constant misadventures - should something happen to me, at least he won't be forgotten." He shrugged with a small chuckle.

K: "You'll be fine, Doc." I smirked. "If anyone fails to make it home from this War, it'll probably be me. My Doctor's Bill is high enough as it is."

Dr. Allcome: "Yes, I am rather surprised you managed to make it off that island without getting killed, or seriously injured. You do have a habit of that. Hopefully, our next expedition won't see you in the same straits." He started going through some things in his bag.

K: "Alright, well, I have other things to do. Mac told me to delegate, that's what I'm going to do. I'll catch you later, Doc."

And with that, I was off. First stop was the Barn. Golden Harvest was there, setting up the new 'base station' radios that I ordered installed at Ponyville, given that it was my primary home and thus, the de facto Central Military Command when I was at home. She had a few others helping her. Written Script was off to the side, checking his clipboard.

K: "Script, message time." I nodded.

Written Script: "Of course." He nodded.

K: "Alright. The Navy is to take over two more bulk cargo ships, and load all remaining Marines in the country, except for the Training Unit at Fillydelphia, along with any spare Shermans, Zhukovs, and Lee's and as much spare nine-mil ammo that they can carry, along with other military supplies that we have to spare. Throw in 2nd Battalion, 10th Company of the Royal Army. Forest Spirit and Tankette Blinda will be taking command of this unit. They are to depart for Neighpon once loaded with supplies and troops. Their objective is to aide in the liberation of Neighpon. We will provide as much materiel support as we can. Upon arrival, a skeleton crew from the naval warships in the Neighpon area are to disembark their ships and serve as training instructors for the Neighponese Imperial Navy. The ships are then to return to port for replacement by Steel Hull Warships along the Steel Fleet plan."

Written Script: "Understood."

K: "Next message. The Royal Army is to expand to nine Battalions in two Brigades, plus a full Airborne Brigade. Include that reorganization chart in there, that I wrote up. Each major region of Equestria is to have one Battalion of Royal Army ready to go, in addition to the local militias."

Written Script: "Got that." He was scribbling furiously.

K: "Next message. Lieutenant of the Guard Ironhide is to be promoted to Commander of the Royal Guard." Shining Armor needed to be replaced. I trusted Ironhide.

Written Script: "I.. undersand, K." He nodded.

K: "Next message. All local Committee's of Safety are to field at least one platoon of Gendarmes for every 10,000 citizens - or, one Squad for every 1,000 citizens. Smaller towns and cities are to have one Squad of Gendarmes and one squad of a trained volunteer posse to handle crime and espionage. I also want the formation of the Equestrian Central Office of Gendarmes to go through - make a note that they are to take responsibility for counter-intelligence, and military intelligence in addition to their primary duties of protecting the citizenry and solving crime."

Written Script: "Understood." He finished that message and set it aside."

K: "Next message. Production of all non-NEIGHTO compliant firearms is to cease at all military arsenals. From now on, if we hand out military aid, it's going to be NEIGHTO-compliant weapons. If we get any back from Neighpon, Prance, Germaneigh, or any of the others, they're to be arsenaled and put into storage, though I do want them to be available on the commercial market." I nodded. "Civilian contractors are to take over production of non-NEIGHTO compliant ammunition, for civilian consumption."

Written Script: "Got it." He nodded.

K: "Next message. At first possible convenience, all non-NEIGHTO compliant weapons and ammunition are to be purged from military and militia inventory. As before, they will be put into storage, and sold on the commercial market."

Written Script: "Anything else?"

K: "Last message. The Naval Yards are to complete all future ordered ships along the Steel Hull plan, including the ships under construction at this time."

Written Script: "Got it." He nodded.

K: "Alright, then. Thank you. Get those sent off as soon as possible." I nodded.

Written Script: "Of course." He nodded and toddled off.

Golden Harvest: "Love that Stallion." *Dreamy sigh* "You know, Scoots accepts him? She even calls him Dad from time to time."

K: "..well, that's a hell of a lot better than how she USED to be." I smirked.

Golden Harvest: "And you made it happen." She gave me a one-foreleg-hug and got back to work.


TIME: 12:22
LOCATION: The Doctor's Social Club


So, I was invited here. It was Wednesday, and Dr. Whooves promised me a cigar. I honestly didn't know if I wanted it, but the thought of interacting with people - PEOPLE in PONY BODIES - that were wiser than me? Hell yeah!

Mr. Smith met me at the door.

Mr. Smith: "You don't drink, do you?" He said, setting my cap on the hat rack.

The interior looked like an Old English Gentleman's Club, suitably down-sized. Fine carved wood, paintings - EARTH paintings, I should point out - and the delightful scent of good pipe tobacco. The kind that doesn't smell like tobacco any longer, but has a sweet texture that plays along the nose like a gentle lover.

K: "Not normally. Back home, I can count on one hand the number of alcoholic drinks I've ever had." It's true, too.

Mr. Smith: "Well, do come in." He took me into the main room.

And I felt like I was walking out on stage. All of the previous Doctors were there. Each a different colored Pony, each with the same Cutie Mark - an hourglass - though the 1st and 3rd Doctors' were silver framed, and the 9th's was a sort of brushed brass color.

Mr. Smith: "Gentlemen." He presented me.

K: "Gentlemen." I nodded a little. "I am sorry that I wasn't an avid watcher of your adventures back home, but-"

The First: "Pish-posh, lad. You had no idea." He gave a dismissive hoof wave.

Dr. Whooves: "K----. I see you took me up on my offer!" He gave a bit of a grin.

K: "I did." I nodded in return. "It's.. a treat."

Mr. Smith: "To speak to those who's mind set is in some way similar to your own. Someone who knows your Earth, and all of the things that go with it. For good or for ill." He motioned for me to take a seat.

Dr. Whooves: "Well? How do you feel?"

K: "..surprisingly normal. Like I'm back home, but in England."

Eleven (Time Twister): "You know, it's.. it's designed like that." He shrugged. He had a tawny coat, and a brushed brown mane. And a bow tie and collared shirt with a vest over it.

K: "You're the one that likes bow ties." I recalled, my knowledge limited as it was. "But.. your show.. it just started." I blinked, and pointed to him. "When did he get here, if I may ask?"

Mr. Smith: "Recently, but don't worry about it. For all YOU know, we're from an even more alternate universe. Reminding you, of course, that all eleven of us are technically the same person - yet, somehow, not."

Dr. Whooves: "Mm. Just as I'm more lighthearted -"

Mr. Smith: "- I'm not nearly as easy to anger, and less likely to draw blood." He gave a look to his newer counterpart.

Time Twister: "I've just become acquainted with your story. I'm right - uh, THEY'RE right - you're probably going to be the most interesting thing in the world, here."

Four O'Clock (4th Doctor): "Yes. Very interesting." He looked at me - and he had that scarf, oh yes - and looked over at Dr. Whooves' Morgan pistol. "Though the technology is certainly lacking."

K: "If I could make Stun Phasers, I would, then if it were feasible to do so, I would take each prisoner before a court." I shrugged. "But, of course, I haven't those means."

Mr. Smith: "And again, this is why we.. observe you." He nodded.

K: "Rather than, say, taking the 'you-know-what' that I was 'never inside' and depositing me back where I came from?"

Mr. Smith: "Exactly." He served me tea. "Not saying we can or can't - just that we haven't."

K: "It's fascinating that you're all here. I mean, really - you alone are anecdotal evidence of other worlds."

Mr. Smith: "Unless you're dead, and this is in fact the afterlife for you - in which case, it can easily be called Hell. You're in a war that you didn't want, doing things you never wished, and failing miserably at holding up the tenents of your own faith, which you never fully subscribed to."

Time Twister: "Or-or heaven.. I mean.. you have a family, someone that loves you - two, actually - and you're not fighting a morally questionable conflict, but a very black-and-white one. And doing so from a position that has thus far avoided moral quagmires."

K: "Very true.. both of them." I shrugged. "Or it's Purgatory in one sense of the word - I am truly between Heaven and Hell. Which calls into question what would happen if I died here?"

Dr. Whooves: "Who knows? That's something else we're interested in finding out, actually - but, of course, we won't hasten your death. See, some of us actually LIKE you."

The First: "You're entertaining. And it's certainly better than beating myself at cribbage all the time." He snorted. "Or drinking and contemplating my errors."

K: "Well, I'm honored." Dr. Whooves handed me a cigar, which I idly cut and lit. "Fine stuff." I said, taking a look at it. Surprisngly, my head didn't get all swimmy, like it does if I've gone without a smoke in ages.

Dr. Whooves: "Honduran." He shrugged.

K: "Right, right, no questions about that stuff." I nodded. "Still, I am rather glad that you all have.. somewhere to go. Somewhere.. perhaps not rewarding, but restful." I shrugged.

Four O'Clock: "I do appreciate the sentiment. See? Stop calling yourself a monster. If we - I - can accept everything that has been done before, then you can certainly accept your lot in life. We - I - have access to things you can't imagine. If anyone could have stopped things, found a way to prevent things, and avoid death at all costs, it's us - me. And we - I - didn't."

Mr. Smith: "He's right, you know. You won't last much longer with the self-hatred eating you up inside. It could lead to some rash actions - something we're all rather familiar with."

*Murmurs of agreement*

Besides the pep talk, I was mainly quizzed about my own life on Earth - things I'd seen, experiences I'd had, my opinions on certain matters, things like that. It wasn't so much a personality test as an interview. They wanted to learn about me, and learn why I thought the way I did. I even had a sip of some fine burbon or another - I was assured it was a fine bottle, but as always, all I could really taste was the alcohol. I never liked that taste. It seemed like I spent all afternoon there, but when it was time to go, and Dr. Whooves escorted me out, I looked at my watch, and..


TIME: 12:44

Ah, those Doctors.

But now, I had to plan the salvation of the Crystal Kingdom..
