Part 1: Fool's Gold

TIME: 17:44 QEST
DATE: War Day 859/13 Octavius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: La Salle County, Region Nord, Republique du Quirtbeck

K: "Gorcat, Katrina, Twilight, Babs, Norfy, Cosmic, Gaze." I pointed. "Juli, dig in right here." I nodded.

Twilight: "I'm curious what this thing looks like.." She checked her belt, and fastened the next one to the end.

Gorcat: "You and me both, Twi." He nodded, doing the same to his own. "You gotten any stronger, now that you're a Dragon-Pony?"

Twilight: "Ahh.." *Blush* "..physically, yes, I'm a good bit stronger. Not quite as strong as Applejack, but close."

Katrina: "I'd say that, indeed, makes you a Draconic Alicorn. You have traits of all three major Pony species." She shrugged.

Twilight: "I suppose it does!" She beamed a grin. "I wonder what my lifespan will be like."

Katrina: "I wouldn't be shocked if you lived to be over a thousand, without any magical buffs in play." She nodded.

Twilight: "That would.. be.. nice, I guess?" She shrugged.

K: "Don't worry, Twilight." I nodded, chamber-checking my Grant. "If I turn out to be immortal, I'll make sure you're not lonely."

She smiled a bit.

K: "I'm kinda wondering if what we did in the Crystal Kingdom would mean a thousand years of fun." I was teasing.

She turned bright red.

Flash Sentry.. kinda narrowed his eyes at me, a bit, but he was behind me, and I didn't see it. Dusty and Corazi both did, however.

K: "Let's move." War Face on, I took point.

One of my new inventions for the stalwart Gavin grenade launcher was Beehive Shells. Based on the 40mm Buckshot Grenade, I used a larger shot size, and direct kinetic energy transfer, instead of the "high-to-low" pressure system that NATO 40mm grenades used. Unlike the 40mm Buckshot, this was actually four tubes of Shot clustered into one grenade hull, with a very high initial velocity.

It was the equivalent of firing three shotgun shells at once, though the spread pattern was VERY wide.

I had one of these loaded, as I entered the fake Mine.

We didn't hear a single sound for 200 meters, then, we could hear faint talking. We soon found that the invaders had bypassed, disabled, or brute-forced several traps or puzzles deeper in the mine, meant to safeguard the Weather Rock.

Part of me was thankful - part of me regretted that these puzzles and tricks were damaged as historical artifacts, now.

Finally, we arrived at a grand staircase that led down. A pair of Camels were in one corner, lighting cigarettes, and I could hear conversation from the bottom of the stairs.

I tapped Gorcat, and the two of us crept over to the Camels. He grabbed his target with his claws, and just used his powerful beak to sever its esophagus. I grabbed mine by the skull, jammed my knife into its neck, and punched out.

Targets down, we moved to the edge of the stairs.

We could see three of them were off to one side, consulting. One Donkey, one Pony, and one Griffon. The Camel guards were milling about, led by a junior officer.

I motioned for the team to move up. We had a perfect firing position.

We all sighted in on the Camels.. and..

K: "FIRE!"

Automatic gunfire filled the cave, and cut down the invaders in short order - only one of them had a chance to even REACH for their rifle, but he was scored in the head by a shotgun shell of Katrina's before he could.

We then proceeded down the stairs, with me changing magazines, and then aiming my rifle at the Archaeologists.

K: "Don't fucking move." I stated plainly.

Dr. Hoofler: "Oh, MY! Gentlemen!" He raised his hooves.

Dr. Lepigoza: "Equestrian Troops!" He likewise raised his.

Dr. Gormutton: "Oh, for the love of the Nest.." He narrowed his eyes at Gorcat. "Hello, son."

K: "..oh, you have GOT to be SHITTING ME!" I turned to Gorcat.

Gorcat: "Hey, Dad!" He beamed a grin, then got serious. "Gimme a reason not to turn you into a featherduster. My Blood Brother, K----, here, could use one since his last one got BLOWN AWAY by a CYCLONE!"

Twilight ran back and got Gorton, who came down, and nodded to the other Griffon.

Capt. Gorton: "Bro." His nod was short. "General K, this is my brother, Gormutton." He also low-aimed his F1 at him. "No love lost, sir."

K: "Oh." I shrugged. "And you two?" I nodded to the Donkey and Pony.

Dr. Hoofler: "Dr. Shoedon Hoofler, University of Ouaricon." He nodded.

Dr. Lepigoza: "Dr. Shabley Lepigoza, University of Mulexico City." He shrugged.

K: "What the hell are you doing here, then, Dr. Hoofler?" I tilted my head.

Dr. Hoofler: "My.. job?" He blinked.

I stuck the tip of my rifle to his nose.

K: "Don't get fucking cute with me." I growled. "My home was wiped off the face of the Earth by Tirek and some of his goons, with a Tornado, about a month ago. We Gelded and Exiled them, the ring leaders were shot as traitors. You get cute with me, you FUCK with me, you JOIN them as a Traitor to Princess Celestia, Luna and all of Equestria!" I looked at Dr. Lepigoza. "I'll just EAT you!" I wagged the tip of my rifle in his face. "Donkey's good eating. Makes a fine stew." I cocked a brow.

Dr. Lepigoza: "Erhh!?" He was horrified and.. curious. "Listen.. Human.. I have no intention of resisting! Neither do my colleagues! We are here on a legitimate research mission! Sponsored by the Sultan of Orghuz! We were paid well for our knowledge!"

K: "Aha." I nodded. "So.. you had no idea you were working for an enemy power?"

Dr. Hoofler: "Since when is the Sultan of Orghuz an enemy?!" He was genuinely confused.

Twilight: "Since we sank over a dozen of his warships in the Eyesore Islands last month. While trying to prevent them from linking up with the survivors of the same Unicorn Supremacist Group that caused the Tornado, with Tirek's help. We're not quite sure how, yet, but Tirek and the Sultan seem to be teaming up." She nodded to them.

Dr. Hoofler: "Oh, well, yes, I suppose that would do it." He shrugged. "Honestly, Mr. General, we had no idea!"

K: "General is my title, not my name." I corrected him.

Dr. Hoofler: "Fascinating, isn't it, Doctor?" He turned his head to Dr. Lepigoza.

Dr. Lepigoza: "Indeed, Doctor! I didn't think we'd actually get to MEET him!" He whinny'd in excitement. "Tell me, General, if we surrender willingly, can.. can I interview you?!" He..

..these two were scientists first, and only. I could see that. Purely Eggheads. They had absolutely no ill intentions at all. All they sought, was knoweldge.

K: "They're cool." I motioned for everyone to lower their weapons. "Gorcat.. you need some time to work out your family issue, there?" I nodded, noticing he was staring lasers at his father, and his father right back. "Maybe some fisticuffs?"

Gorton: "Considering how we all parted ways, General, it would be a fight to the death." He shrugged. "GORCAT!" He corrected him. "War first. Personal issues, afterwards."

Gorcat: "..yeah." He nodded. "Sorry, K."

K: "You're fine!" I shrugged. "I wasn't going to interfere in a family matter. Gorton.." I pointed to him. "..that's exactly what a leader does."

Gorton: "Oh. Awww.. shit, I'm going to end up commanding them, aren't I?" He seemed offended and sheepish all at once. "Don't tell Colonel La Selle, please?" He winced a bit.

Dr. Gormutton: *LAUGHTER* "You always DID shirk your responsibilities!" And shook his head. "You Slacker!"

Gorton: "You watch your beak, Brother." He glared at him.

Gorcat: "Slacker's.. a kinda high grade insult in our language." He shrugged.

K: "Aha." I nodded. "Dr. Gormutton?" I addressed him directly, now.

Dr. Gormutton: "Yes, Human?" He gave me a tired, exasperated sigh.

K: "General K." I corrected him.

Dr. Gormutton: "General K." He corrected himself.

K: "And what university or insitiution are you from?" I tilted my head.

Dr. Gormutton: "I'm here at the behest of the Royal Institute for Science. The.. Griffonic Royal Institute for Science." He nodded.

K: "Ohhh... that's.. that's going to be a problem, isn't it?" I frowned.

Dr. Gormutton: "Probably, but politics aren't my thing." He shrugged. "What'cha gonna do with us?" He looked at the other two, who were quietly conversing. "Unlike them, I do have the ability to think in practical terms.. and I'm aware of the danger I'm in."

K: "I.." I shrugged. "..Equestria needs the Weather Rock. Cloudsdale was destroyed, and without it, control over the weather is incredibly difficult." I nodded to him. "Help us, and maybe Her Highness will employ you. Remain neutral, and we'll just have you sent home." I shrugged, shouldering my rifle. "How's that work for you?"

Dr. Gormutton: "...beats being torn up." He shrugged and crossed his arms. "Doctor Hoofler?"

Dr. Hoofler: "AH! Ah, yes. We were about to breach the final chamber to the Weather Rock.. but.. there's an issue." He shrugged. "May.. may we put our forelegs down, now?"

K: "...yes, yes, Doctor." I gestured.

Eggheads that were.. almost one dimensional in their nerdiness. Not enemies, just stallions interested in science. They were utterly dense otherwise. But, I liked them. They were like a pair of nerdy uncles..

..now, though, we had a Weather Rock to retrieve.

Part 2: Rocked


TIME: 17:57 QEST
DATE: War Day 859/13 Octavius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: La Salle County, Region Nord, Republique du Quirtbeck

La Selle: C> "General! The enemy force is out front. We are engaging!"

K: C> "Kick their asses, Juli." I nodded to the Archaeologists. "Alright. How do we get through the final barrier?"

Dr. Hoofler: "Well.. that's the thing. It requires an artifact we don't have." He shrugged. "Here. Come here." He kinda.. pulled me over to the wall - there was a slot here, roughly diamond shaped. "Something needs to be inserted here, to unlock the main cover to the stone. Moreover, even when we do.." He pointed to some writing on the wall. "..we will need something else. The letters are horribly faded, but it says something about a.. a palm? We're wondering why a palm tree would be needed, here, since this isn't a tropical-"

K: "A palm PRINT, Doctor." I held up my hand, and tapped my palm. "This is a palm. The palm of my hand." I nodded.

Dr. Lepigoza: "Ahhhhh! Fascinating!" He nodded repeatedly. "Still.. useless unless we can figure out how to utilize this slot."

K: "Huh." I nodded.

Gorcat: "Hey, boss.. doesn't that shape kinda look like the tip of your sword?" He nodded to the hole.

K: "..I wonder!" I unsheathed the Sword of Rainbow's Light and just stuck it in - it fit perfectly and I heard a click. Rotating the sword, a huge round dome in the center of the room, retracted. "Well, I'll be!" I nodded.

As I walked up to it, I could see.. evidence.. that they'd been thinking of the Human of Legend when they created these markings and inscriptions. Someone had the bright idea that only a catastrophe of that magnitude would call for the Weather Rock to be unsealed.. and, thus, created this whole thing to only be openable by a human, with the Sword of Rainbow's Light.

Though, realistically, a Gizmonk could probably do this, as well, with the right "lock pick" for the wall section.

I slid my hand over the "palm print" area.. it was the right size, alright, and it had holes in it. I slipped my fingers in, felt something click, rotated the panel, and the whole thing lifted away.

There, sitting on a pedestal, was a rock that cast its own light, was permanently wet, and had a breeze coming off of it. The Weather Rock. Fortunately, a VERY detailed stone tablet of instructions was included!

Twilight had a look at it, reading it carefully, with the Doctors over her shoulder.

Twilight: "Mmm.. there's a whole list of incantations on here. Mind you, ANY magic user could use this Rock. We'll need to take it to the original site of Cloudsdale, and set it up, there.. but, once I activate this spell, and.. we'll have to alter the spell constantly, so it changes weather.. and it looks like we need to set up Repeater Sigils across most of Equestria to use it right.." She examined the tablet, intently, making little nerdy noises every so often.

Dr. Gormutton: "Is she always like this?" He looked at his son.

Gorcat: "..yeah. But we love her, anyway." A pause. "Like a sister, dad!" He gave him a look.

Dr. Gormutton: "I was about to say!" He snorted, then looked at me. "I do hope my son hasn't been a burden."

K: "Oh, horribly so. He's gone from a Warrant Officer to a First Lieutenant, he's up for Captain, decorated three times for bravery, helped me destroy a pair of massive machines about seventy some odd meters tall with gigantic cannons, slain probably close to 500 enemy soldiers himself.. yes, yes, a terrible burden." I stared at him, deadpan.

Dr. Gormutton: "HA! The Human is cheeky!" He smirked a bit, gesturing to me, and nodding to the other two. "Well, the Legend never said you'd be like the Ponies. Or.. an adult. To be honest, I expected a little kid, you know, bubbling with the magic of friendship and all."

K: "Oh, I bubble with.. friendship.. don't I, Katrina?" I smirked.

Katrina: "Oh, yes.. his friendship is about yea thick, yea tall, and ALL night long." SHE got sassy with him, and flicked her tail. "Plus, he married one of the Elements of Harmony and.. has a sizable stable that includes BOTH Princesses." A nod. "And a female Griffon, named Gilda."

I wiggled my eyebrows at him.

He.. bowed a little bit. Again, this is a pack/pride oriented species, and I just demonstrated that I'm a High Alpha. With but one statement, Katrina dropped a cultural bomb on Gormutton, and cemented my status, in his eyes, as Worthy.

La Selle: C> "Enemy formation run to ground and eliminated, K." She reported. C> "Three injured. Your cousin among them - she is very brave! But, fear not, it is not serious."

K: C> "Roger that, Cognac." I nodded. "She better be okay, my wife'll kill me." I smirked a bit.

Twilight: "K? I think I have everything I need." She nodded firmly. "We can get out of here, now."

K: C> "Cognac, front door clear?" I called, to be sure.

La Selle: C> "Oui, guests are swept under ze door mat."

K: "Let's go." I motioned, and took point.

Gorcat was behind me.

Gorcat: "..there's a lot going on between me and my folks, K." He said, quietly.

K: "Wanna talk about it, later?" I shrugged.

Gorcat: "Sure." He smiled. "Maybe these ponies got something.. talking about problems, that is." He shrugged.

We got up to the top, and Babs was being tended-to by Dr. Allcome. She sat up, seeing me, and nodded.

Babs: "S'no big deal. Shrapnel." She shrugged. "I'm sure I'll have worse before it's over."

K: "Try not to, huh?" I tilted my head at her.

Babs: "No problem!" She smirked.

La Selle: "It was one company. We.. cut zem down before they could react. These are not, how you'd say, very well trained soldiers." She shrugged. "Ze general is asking what will become of him?"

K: "THAT.. is technically up to you. Quirtbeck is in Union with Prance, so.." I shrugged. "I will, however, offer Carusel Island's facilities."

La Selle: "Hm. A good idea. I think imprisonment for now, will be fine. Until we determine the hostility of the Sultan of Orghuz and his intentions, oui?" She nodded to the Doctors. "And these are?"

K: "Doctors Hoofler, Lepigoza, and Gormutton - Captain Gorton's brother, and Lieutenant Gorcat's father." I nodded. "Archaeologists. They've surrendered."

La Selle: "Ah! And you have granted clemency?" She nodded, motioning for everyone to round up.

K: "Indeed. They're smart people.." I shrugged. "..and not all that hostile."

La Selle: "Oui." She nodded. "Come! We go!"

With that, we marched away from the Cave. Interesting, to me, that this place - a mine for Fool's Gold - would have not only references to the Human of Legend, but also the Sword of Rainbow's Light. As though the Unicorns of the past thought that the only possible emergency where this thing might be needed, was my appearance.


TIME: 22:33
LOCATION: 20km from the Mine

We finally settled down for the evening. The Archaeologists, Twilight, and Katrina, all discussed the amazing finds deep in the cave. All the little inscriptions. We simply hadn't gone in deep enough, the first time, to find all of this.

Since we were fairly certain we wouldn't be interrupted by enemy action, we had a fire going, and pitched tents. Gorcat took a seat near me.

Gorcat: "Y'know.. before we met in the Crystal Kingdom.. I didn't really have any friends." He shrugged, fishing his tobacco pouch from the tunic breast pocket of his combat uniform. "I had my.. well, my crew. That's different - they're all cousins, or whatever. But, you gotta keep up a front around them, you know what I mean?"

K: "I think I do." I nodded, sipping some warmed apple juice.

Gorcat: "I was originally outcast because I dishonored my father." He nodded to where Dr. Gormutton was sleeping. "It.. was.. a big cultural thing. He wanted me to follow in the family business - service to the Crown, through intellectual contributions. Realize, we got some schools and stuff, but those just teach the basics, and aren't completely mandatory. My pops, over there, he.. tutored me. Taught me to read and write in three languages. Stuff like that." He rolled one and lit it from a stick from the fire. "I told him he was a chump. That being a scientist doesn't get you anywhere. And, yeah, we weren't the richest family. What impressed me, was Goreham's dad. He was an Air Pirate. Used to come back with loot all the time. He.. kinda inspired me to bulk out, and taught me to fight a little. Called his brother, my dad, a softie egghead. A flip-flop." He shrugged, again, and puffed. "One day, I was about 15.. Dad told me he won a spot for me at the University. To study general science, at first, he wanted me to pick my own specialty. That meant I'd be trapped there for about six years, learning whatever. Then, I'd have to get a job, either with the University, or the Crown." He snorted, derisively. "I told my dad to fuck right off with that shit." He shook his head slowly, staring straight ahead. "I told him he never understood me in the first place." Gorcat turned and looked at me. "I didn't want to be either an Air Pirate OR a Scientist.." He looked down. "..I wanted to be a stage actor, like my mom."

K: "Oh." I blinked. "I'm.. guessing she wasn't aro-"

Gorcat: "Died when I was 12." He frowned. "But, either way, I absolutely did NOT want to be what HE wanted me to be!" He nodded. "Pops always treated me like his little clone, anything I did that he didn't like, he berated me, told me it was stupid. In front of my mom and my siblings." He shook his head a little. "So, in Public, I told him off but good. I told him that he never once cared about my feelings, my input, my wants, my thoughts.. that he was a greedy, self-obsessed feather duster.." He gestured a bit. "..and I kinda suggested he sucked dick to get where he was. Like, literally sucked dick. In public. Our culture doesn't.. take kindly to such outbursts. So.. I had a decision. Issue a public apology and let him punish me in public - usually a butt whoop'n, sometimes The Spray, few other things - or tell him off again, and let him disown me. I let him disown me. I was so angry at him for treating me the way he did for 15 years, I couldn't stand it." He nodded. "So, I became an outcast."

Dr. Gormutton: "..I only pushed you, son, because you were the smartest out of the two Clutches your mother ever gave me." He rolled over. "The. Absolute. Smartest." He was very firm about that. "Remember your sister? Gokitty? She shacked up with Brunt."

Gorcat: "THAT swindler?!" He snorted.

Dr. Gormutton: "Your brother, Gordog. Failed his entrance exams. He WANTED to be just like me.. but he's a bird brain. Well intentioned, but he never had the smarts for it." A snort from him. "He became a City Guard in Grylan." He sat up at this point. "I could go on. No, son, I was angry at YOU for throwing away what you had. You got MY intelligence.. MY thought process.. MY ability to think outside the box. MY object permanence. Oh, sure, some of your siblings had some of those traits, but you had it ALL!" He waved his clawed hand wide. "And you THREW it away. YOU wanted to be an.. entertainer." He grumbled. "I should have expected it. Your mother." He shook his head. "My punishment, I suppose, for tempting fate and daring the Gods with my impertinent questions about the past. I get a son that has everything I ever wanted to see in a son, and he turns out to be.. a CREATIVE.. type."

Gorcat: "Now, I'm a soldier. An officer. And a damn good one." He narrowed his eyes.

Dr. Gormutton: "If what the hu-" He looked and me and grimaced in apology. "If what General K says is accurate? Yes, you are. I didn't think you'd be BRAVE as well as smart. I thought you'd be.. well.. a coward, like your old man."

Gorcat: "You're no coward. You're just not a fighter, Pops." He shook his head.

Dr. Gormutton: "General K.. we.. don't usually speak around outsiders about our culture." He shrugged. "Being an Outcast.. understand.. it wasn't supposed to be the death sentence it's nearly become. Being Outcast from your family simply meant you didn't measure up, or you made a mistake.. it's supposed to give you the FREEDOM to make up for it. And one day return, in glory, showing that you've excelled from your previous disgrace. The problem is, especially in the last several hundred years, being Outcast was applied far too liberally, and those Outcast stopped seeing it as a chance to repent or repair, and instead, saw it as a chance to create mischief without our rules and laws getting in the way." He grunted and sighed. "Very few return to their Nest in true Glory. Most return as blood-soaked ravagers, pirates, and brigands.. and some families have equated this banditry with glory, and accepted them." He shook his head. "I never did.. but.." He nodded to Gorcat. "..son, you've done me proud, standing against the Darkness. You may not accept me for the things I did to you, but I consider you an Outcast no longer. Not to me." He nodded a bit.

Gorcat: "...thanks, Pops." He looked down at the fire. "Thank the Human. He's the one who.." He looked at me. "Encouraged me to get this far. He forgave me for what I did to him four years ago, and he brought me into his Pride.. his Herd.. and made me one of him. An equal."

K: "A friend." I leaned over and one-arm hugged him.

Gorcat: "Heh." He smirked. "Yeah. A real friend." He smiled.

And sometimes, mending bridges is three guys talking around the firelight, and just being guys. One being the 'bigger man' and offering forgiveness, and the other, being the 'bigger man' again, and accepting it, not out of prostration, but out of genuine love, and wanting to heal the hurt and pain.

My friend, Gorcat.

Part 3: Return of the Bad Weather

TIME: 08:56 ERDT
DATE: War Day 863/20 Octavius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Eqlinburg, Greenbroke

Returning with the Weather Rock, we had to make a stop in a smallish town in rural Greenbroke. The issue? We needed to patch one of the steam lines in the Engine, as it was leaking slightly. Nothing severe.. YET.. but Coal and Steamer both wanted to make absolutely sure it wouldn't rupture.

Twilight: "Well.. they'll be a couple of hours.. who wants breakfast?" She shrugged.

K: "Sounds good." I got up, and fastened my pistol belt. "Let's see if I can't get a snow globe for Starlight Mint. It might cheer her up." I lowered my head. "I had to send away for a bunch - most of hers were destroyed in the Tornado."

Twilight: "I didn't even think of that! Wasn't the one from Marelin-"

K: "One of a kind." I shrugged. "War's war. Things are things, and things can be replaced. Lives, can't." I nodded.

Dusty: "Hm. Suppose I'll come with." She nodded.

Flash Sentry: "Me, too." He nodded firmly.

Webley: "Why not?" She shrugged.

Firecracker: "I'm in!" She smiled. "I mean, this is a mountain town - my kind of living!"

So, the lot of us debarked the train, and headed into the town proper. It wasn't an unpleasant little place.. it just felt kinda off. Something.. was up.

Then, we saw a pony with the oddest cutie mark - an Equal Sign. Yes, a "=" on their butt.

Webley: "Huh.. doesn't.. that.." She scratched her head. "..I'm not getting a reception out here, but, something feels.."

Troter: "Hello, everyone. I'm Troter. You must be new here." He came up and nodded to us.

K: "Yes, I'm General K." I nodded. "These are some of my friends." I gestured.

Troter: "Welcome to Eqlinburg, Town of Total Harmony." He nodded to us.. robotically.

K: "Total.. harmony?" I looked around, and realized, all of the Ponies here had = signs for Cutie Marks.. as far as the eye could see.

Troter: "Yes, Total Harmony. Our leader, Starlight Glimmer, is most wise. She discovered that the secret to Total Harmony is sameness." He smiled, a plastic, saccharin grin.

K: "..right." I nodded. "Twilight?"

Twilight: "No clue, but something's quite off here." She frowned.

Flash was almost standing in front of her..

Troter: "Everyone! We have new settlers!" He announced.

They all started coming towards us.

K: "Fall back!" I ordered.

EVERYONE cleared leather at this point - call it a sixth sense for magical fuckery at this point in our lives, we'd seen WAY too much of it.

We ran back towards the train, but we didn't quite get there.

Flash: "GENERAL!" He slammed into me and I went down..

..just as a Pershing opened up on us from the train station.

K: "FUCK ME!" I profaned, and reached for my hand set. C> "Cosmic! Gaze! We got a situation!"

No answer.

I crawled to cover, and Twilight put up a magical smoke screen. We ran towards the other side of town, making a circuit around the very edge.

K: C> "Alpha Actual to all callsigns! Someone respond!" I called into the radio hand set.

Starlight Glimmer: C> "Ahh.. didn't expect YOU of all people! Surrender. Now. I have your train and your friends."

K: C> "Catch me if you can." I nodded and threw the radio away. "Run for it!"

We dashed.. moving as fast as we could. I couldn't tell if these ponies were all under a spell, brainwashed, or whatever. I didn't want to hurt them if I didn't have a choice. I knew the city of Burlington was about 30km to the south - we could get there in a couple days, and come back with the State Militia.

Right now? I wanted us keeping our distance from everyone. We fled towards the mountains to the south-east of the settlement.. about seven kilometers away.

Twilight: "What's going ON here?!" She finally asked.

Webley: "I-I'm sorry, Twilight!" She sniffled. "I can't get a reception at ALL! Like.. I should be getting SOMETHING in that town, but.. it's like.. it's being blocked!" She whined. "I'm useless!"

K: "Nonsense, Major. You're still Airborne, and one of my best officers." I nodded to her.

Flash Sentry: "We got a plan, sir?" He shrugged.

Firecracker: "Keep the hell away from those crazies, for one!" She snorted.

K: "No kidding. We'll head for the mountains, and try to use them as cover. It'll be about two days, but we can walk to Burlington and get help." I nodded. "Then, we come back with a rescue team."

Dusty: "..what if she brainwashes our friends, K?" She blinked.

K: "I.." I lowered my head. "..I don't know. If there's some way to fix them, of course, you know I won't ask any of you to.." I shrugged. "..hurt them, kill them, whatever."

Twilight: "Whatever she's up to? We'll get some help, then we'll put a stop to it!" She snorted, angrily. "Webley, come on - let's pop up and take a look!" She tapped her, and up they both went, for a short scouting flight.

Firecracker: "You know, sir, when Princess Celestia suggested I join your staff, I didn't think I'd end up doing anything like this." She shrugged.

K: "Yeah, well.. as Gaze once said, Join the Army, Fight Nasty Wizards." I smirked.

Dusty: "..I can tell she's changed." She nodded. "Twilight before becoming a.. what she is now? She'd never think this aggressively."

K: "Oh, yeah. I'm glad to see it. I want her to be Prime Minister of a Constitutional Parliamentary Monarchy after the war." I nodded.

Flash: "Prime Minister?" He tilted his head.

K: "Yes, third in charge of the Government under the Princesses, but the effective leader of same. A Parliament made up of two houses of representatives, where each Pony has a voice that can be brought to Parliament, and their issues discussed, their problems handled, without having to rely on a network of Royal Appointments as city, county, and State leaders to handle problems locally." I shrugged. "The Prime Minister, as I envision it, would be appointed by the Princesses, but confirmed by the Parliament - the middle ground between the Princesses and representative government. But, don't say anything - we haven't made final decisions on anything, yet." I nodded to them.

Dusty: "Sounds great." She nodded. "Maybe this situation wouldn't've happened?"

K: "Maybe." I shrugged, as Twilight came down.

Twilight: "I can see three of them in the scrubland about 150 meters from here. They.. seem to be trying to get away from town." She shrugged.

K: "Well.. they're isolated. We should try to take them - either prisoner, or KIA and deny them to Glimmer." I nodded.

Webley: "No problem." She nodded back to me.

We advanced the next 120 meters silently, staying low. All of us were in basic combat uniforms, so, we all kinda blended in SOMEWHAT with the terrain. Granted, it was all different patterns. Mine was my usual blacks. Webley was in Paratrooper "Pea Spot" Camo. Twilight was in Special Operations Tiger Stripe. Firecracker was in Equestria Woodland. Flash Sentry was in Royal Guard solid dark olive green. Dusty was in Gendarmes Woodland.

We got to the edge of the cliff by the scrubland, and it looked like these three unarmed ponies were trying to go UP the mountain. Not like they were looking for US. Again, something seemed off.

K: "Cover me." I nodded.

Webely: "With pistols." She frowned. "Alright.. alright.." She shrugged, and got into a shooting position, as did the rest.

I moved down another 10 meters, then.. walked out into the open.

K: "Hey, there!" I called to them.

They all stopped.. looked at each other.. then walked slowly over to me.

Horsehead: "Springer Horsehead." She nodded. "You must be General K."

K: "I am.. you just stay right there, okay?" I had my hand on my Dager pistol, but it was holstered.

Horsehead: "Y-Yeah." She sat down. "Listen, General, everyone says you help people in need - well, we're in NEED." She lowered her head a bit. "Have you been to town?"

K: "We just came from there." I nodded.

Horsehead: "Then you know." She nodded. "Look, Starlight stole our Cutie Marks and re-branded us with these things. We don't have access to our special talents, any more." She shrugged. "I used to be really good at climbing mountains.. now.. I'm clumsy." She started weeping bitter tears. "I want my Mark back!"

K: "She captured my command train, and all my friends." I nodded.

Horsehead: "Ohh.." She sank to her belly. "..look.." She rose up again. "..there's only one way to stop her. She has the Cutie Marks hidden away in a vault in the mountain. We're.. we WERE headed there.. but.." She shrugged. "..now, I can't find the courage to do it."

K: "I get it. Where is it?" I nodded.

Horsehead: "Up there, there's a distinct gravel trail. It leads right to the cave." She nodded.

K: "Thanks. Go find some place to hide." I nodded, and returned to the party. "Ohh.. did you all hear that?" I asked.

Twilight: "I sure did!" She sighed loudly. "I have no idea how she pulled that off! But.. if I can get up there, and have a look at things.. I think I can figure it out." She nodded.

What the HELL have I gotten us into, THIS time!?

[End of Part 3]

Part 4: Glimmer

TIME: 09:24 ERST
DATE: War Day 865/19 Octavius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Green Mountains, Greenbroke

We scaled the gravel path, armed only with sidearms. Better than nothing, I supposed.. but this whole situation was beyond freaky. Beyond nerve-wracking.

This wasn't willful treason, criminals masquerading as soldiers, and it wasn't ethnic cleansing. This was a Hero's Nightmare - friends turned into Enemies because of magic or hypnosis. Targets you CANNOT kill, CANNOT use your normal advantages on. No, our guns were an absolute last resort.

The scale of the mountain was pretty high.. I guessed this was the Equestrian equivalent of Mount Mansfield. Lots of carved plateus, though, showing a different geological evolution. The path itself was fairly easy to scale, though, thankfully - the gravel was compacted enough to get a good grip on, even with my two legs.

Flash: "..don't worry, okay?" He was talking to Twilight. "We'll save them."

Twilight: "I know we will." She nodded.

Flash: "..I won't let her take your mark." He blurted out.

Twilight: "-EH!?" She blinked at him. "Ah.. Flash, thank you, I know your position as a Royal Guard-"

Dusty: "JUST KISS, ALREADY!" She shouted from behind them.

They both turned NEON RED.

Time for Daddy to step in. And I did.

K: "Twilight, Flash has a crush on you, and you've been staring at his ass since the Eyesores." I shrugged. "When I made that sex joke? Dusty told me - he was giving ME the Evil Eye." I nodded to Flash. "Just so you're clearly aware, I wasn't her first, and she knows every way to make you VERY ha-"

Twilight: "K!!!" She screeched, her EARS going red. "That-that.. that's not.. even.. STARTING to be Tactically Relevant!" She looked ready to faint.

FLASH.. looked ready to jump in.

I just smiled.

K: "You'll make a cute couple." I nodded. "Flash. You're a good Stallion.. for whatever it's worth, I approve and endorse."

Flash.. bowed his head a bit.. then nodded.

Flash: "I'm sorry, General.."

K: "Just K." I nodded to him.

Flash: "K." He cleared his throat. "I-I.. have to admit.. Twilight.. ever since I first saw you.. I.." He ducked. "..I've been attracted to you, wanted to protect you.. and that's not because I'm a Guard, it's because I like you. A-A lot.." He nodded. "You were in pain.. Tirek had killed you, your Dad disowned you.. and all I could think of, was.. I can't bear it. If.. you'd been with me already.. I would never have abandoned you."

Webley: "Best you two come clean on that." She nodded. "We may not be alive tomorrow."

Twilight: "I-I.." She ducked, and rubbed the back of her head with her right hoof. "..I'll admit, I've found you.. attractive.. and.. well.. I want to get to know you better, first!" She nodded, firmly. "But, I'm REALLY glad.. you.. think I'm attractive, too.. and you like me." She ducked, again, at this point. "To be honest, I didn't think any Stallion would EVER be interested in me like THIS." She flexed her wings. "And part of me was okay with that." She nodded a bit. "But.. before you go any further, you have to understand, Spike is my son. Not by adoption, but because I laid an egg with him in it."

Flash: "I know, Twilight." He moved closer. "I'm fine with that. I-If.. we get that far.. it doesn't matter to me if he never calls me Dad or anything.. but.. I want to be there for him, too. I've seen him, how he is with Smolder. And.." He looked down and away. "..I want to help him, if I can, you know? Whatever that means."

Twilight: "Oh, Flash." She smiled. "Let's go rescue him, first, okay?"

Flash: "Yeah." He nodded, getting his War Face back on.

Well.. THERE YOU GO, you FILTHY Shippers (love you!)! "Twi-Flash" is NOW A THING!

The rest of the climb was uneventful, but Flash and Twilight were now.. closer.

Dusty and I bro-hoofed over this. She may not be the Princess of Love, but she DAMN SURE saw plenty of Fast Love and TRUE Love in Las Pegasus, and knew the difference.

I hoped Flash was actually in love with her. Twilight was a wonderful person.. I wanted her to be happy.

The cave entrance was nothing special, but we could hear her inside - she'd beaten us here. Probably because of magic teleportation or something. I knew Amethyst could blink across short distances.

Gaze: "YE don't GIT it, Lady!" I could hear him spit vitriol at her. "Ah knows K. He's gonna rescue us. An' when he do, he's gonna pump ya full'a lead!"

Glimmer: "..and, yet, my scouts last reported him running south. He's ABANDONED you, you idiot! Like EVERYONE ELSE ALWAYS DOES!" She sounded maddened..

Lyra: "Ohhh? Whae's that, lass? ALWAYS? Everyone? Didja git stood up by a Stallion, s'that why yer so cross?" She was dripping sarcasm.

Glimmer: "SHUTUP FETISH HORSE!" She screamed.

Havoc: "And what about us, huh? We don't HAVE Cutie Marks! We never DID! What about races that LACK them!?"

Glimmer: "You'll be a good dog once I take away your free will."

Dr. Gormutton: "Impossible. No spell can do that - not one that can't be just as easily reversed!"

Glimmer: "Ohhh.. Mister Griffon-kitty.. I don't plan to use.. MAGIC."

There was a pause.

Havoc: "Oooohhh... I see. Lobotomy." He growled. "You better kill me instead, you stupid Bitch. You get NEAR me or MY TEAM with that thing, we'll RIP YOU APART!"

We were infiltrating.. she had our friends suspended in magical cages, and restrained. A huge.. jar, or something, containing the missing Cutie Marks was at the back of the cave.

K: *Silent Whisper* "Twi, what would happen if I shot that Jar?"

Twilight: "Fifty-fifty chance, the Cutie Marks seek out their original owners. If they don't, they'll just float around the area like a deflated balloon until I can reattach them manually." She nodded.

K: "Go on my shot. Take her down." I nodded.

Glimmer: "I think.. YOU.. will be the perfect start." She stepped up to Norfy with her wooden staff.. and tried to pull his Mark off of him.

Norfy: "...you have a problem, Glimmer." His voice.. was.. not his voice.

K: "..what.."

Norfy shut his eyes, opened them, and they were GLOWING.

Suddenly, his cage EXPLODED, as his Cutie Mark came off.. only for A SECOND mark to be underneath it! A massive blinding cocoon of energy swirled around him, as her Staff held the Cute Mark for Norfy.. he extended his wings.. and simply hovered in the air.

Norpheous: "I AM NORPHEOUS!"

He was now.. A FLUTTER PONY!

Glimmer: "....OH SHIT!"

Gaze: "HOLY CELESTIA!"

Cosmic: "BY TARTARUS!"

Dr. Gormutton: "...OH, NO! BY THE GRAND NEST, NO! YOU FOOL! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'VE JUST DONE!? YOU'VE DOOMED US ALL!" He shrieked at Glimmer.

Glimmer: "I-I.." She was trying to scoot away from him.. she launched a magic bolt towards him, from her horn. "..TAKE THIS!"

He twirled in the air and deflected it away. Norpheous extended his arms.. summoned all his magical energy.. and locked eyes with her.

Norpheous: "UTTER FLUTTER!!"

Suddenly, a gigantic beam of Rainbow energy flowed from his wings, and would have.. probably incinerated her if she didn't instantly teleport away, leaving the staff behind.

When he realized his target was gone.. he turned to Dr. Gormutton.. threateningly..

K: "NORFY!" I stood up, my intervention.. no longer necessary in the slightest.

Norpheous: "Oh?" He turned to face me. "AH! A human!" He seemed surprised, but not angry.

Havoc: "NORPHEOUS! Norpheous, it's ME! HAVOC!" He called out to him. "Remember me!?"

Norpheous fluttered over to Havoc, and Havoc's cage fell to pieces.

Norpheous: "Havoc! You've GROWN so MUCH!" He smiled.

K: "Twilight! Do something!" I flapped my arms.

The thing is.. I could feel Norpheous' energy. His power. It was.. terrifying. I didn't know how it could get this strong.. how.. how could he have such might!? I was honestly afraid.. if he figured out everything that was going on.. he might go berzerk.

Twilight: "Ahh.. mmm.. ehhh.." She dove for the Staff, and once she had it, she used it like a Cattle Prod, STABBING Norfy in the flank with his own Cutie Mark.

I drew the Sword of Rainbow's Light, ran over, and put my hand on his shoulder.

K: "CELESTIA! GIVE! ME! STRENGTH!" I channeled all that energy into him..

..there was a massive blinding flash..

...aaaaand I could feel myself being tossed against a wall.

K.O.!

[End of Part 4]

Part 5: Blinding Light

TIME: 21:33 ERST
DATE: War Day 867/21 Octavius, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Military Hospital, Essex Junction State Militia Headquarters, Greenbroke

I woke up in a military hospital bed. THIS time.. someone brought me my damn slippers! So, I sat u-

AH! FUCK!

I did NOT sit up. Okay.. pain everywhere. Oooo.. been a while since I felt like this.

K: "I'M AWAKE! WHO'S HERE!? WHO'S GOING TO EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON?!" I screamed at the top of my lungs. "AND I NEED SOME PAIN MEDS!"

After a moment, Luna and Applejack flew into the room and.. slowed down before sliding into bed with me. I was being kissed all over.

Applejack: "Ah knew you'd be okay!" She cuddled.

Luna: "As I said, Our General is far tougher than he seems." She cuddled from the other side.

K: "Can.. I get a report?"

Luna: "Mmmm.." She nuzzled me a moment. "You've been Magically Injured. When you summoned Tia's power, into the sword, you caused a massive magical feedback loop, trying to forcibly over-write Norpheous' Cutie Mark with Norfy's. It.. it worked, just.. you and Twilight were both injured. She's okay, she woke up yesterday."

K: "YESTERDAY?! How long was I out?!" I asked.

Applejack: "Better part'a two days.." She shrugged. "..Doc Allcome an' Katrina said you'd snap outta it sooner or later." She tongue-kissed me. "B'tween you'n Norfy, y'all done saved everyone." She nodded. "Even the townsfolk."

K: "What happened to Glimmer?" I asked.

Applejack: "No clue. She popped outta there just before Norpheous melted her int'a'puddle with that Utter Flutter thing!" She snorted, disappointed. "Ah wish ah'd seen it."

Luna: "It's supposed to be amazing." She smiled.

K: "It's scary, is what it is - he melted solid ROCK with that thing!" I chuckled. "Speaking of.. did he make it?"

Luna: "Major Loconsole is just fine, K. He wanted to pass along thanks for saving him." She.. also started making out with me..

..so did AJ.


TIME: 06:33 ERST
DATE: War Day 868/22 Octavius, 1004 C.S.

I sat up.. still achy, but better. Luna was seated on the edge of the bed, reading. After our.. FUN.. last night, of course, she had to stay up to do her nighttime duties.

AJ was passed out next to me.

K: "Luna." I nodded as I stretched.

Luna: "My General." She flirtatiously batted her eyes back.

K: "If this is what 'share nights' are going to be like.." I smirked.

Luna: "Are you thusly inspired to win, that we may enjoy them?" She wiggled her brow.

Applejack: "Y'all keep that magic work up, Luna.." She stretched, and fixed her with a smirk. "..you'n'me c'n have us some fun all by ourselfs more often." She then flicked her tail in my face.

Such a flirt.

Cody and Sweetheart came in, at that point, with a breakfast tray. For all three of us. Because, of course.

Dr. Allcome: "K.. I.." He smirked. "..see you've not only recovered, but started some Physical Therapy." A nod. "Princess Luna. Applejack. Breakfast?"

Eggs, bacon, toast, oatmeal with cream, coffee, alfalfa hay, and a side salad.

K: "Cody! You spoil me." I smirked.

Dr. Allcome: "You'll be pleased to know, everyone is cleared for duty. Norfy included." He nodded.

K: "Good." I managed to extract myself from the bed. "But, I know for a fact we have a huge problem. She's GOING to be back. And it's a 50/50 whether she tries to get in with Tirek." I shrugged. "Question is, who's she going to blame for this? Norfy? Me?"

Webley trotted in at this point, in her Army Class A's. These were, more or less, a direct copy of the U.S. Army's World War II Class A uniform. Sized for ponies.

Webley: "K." She nodded. "She's a powerful mage."

K: "We.. know that one, Webs." I shrugged, getting dressed.

Webley: "No, no, she's stronger than you think. You KNOW I can connect to places like MyLittleWiki, and 4Chan and stuff.. well.. unlike with Cozy Glow? When I try to target HER information? It's actively corrupted. Like.. there's static covering parts of what I'd normally see as readable text." She shrugged, and shook her head. "She was supposed to get mad at Twilight, Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie, Rarity, and Dash. Of course."

K: "Well.. Pinkie isn't here any more..." I rubbed my chin. "..and besides maybe a brief glimpse? She probably didn't even SEE me, you, and the others. So, this was supposed to happen, anyway?"

Webley: "Yep. Differently, but mostly the same. Except.. besides Twilight, the REST of them weren't even THERE!" She shrugged, snagging a slice of toast. "And I don't think she's going to be stupid enough to go after Norfy.. he nearly killed her, last time."

K: "So.. what DID you get?" I snagged a piece of bacon as Luna and Applejack started eating.

Webley: "All I got was, she was going to come back and target the Elements somehow." She finished the toast, and continued. "I'm not sure how. That part's corrupted. And I'm convinced she's the one doing it."

K: "That.. would potentially make her stronger than even Sunset.." I frowned. "Problem is, we now have no idea what she's going to do, when, where, or to whom."

Webley: "Yup." She poured herself a coffee. "That's what we get for having the 'natural order' of events get so messed up with this war, and whatever caused Cozy to, say.. appear early or however that happened. Or Tirek woke up early? I'm not sure."

K: "None of us are." I accepted a cup of coffee from Luna, and took a swig. "I suppose we need to keep our eyes open.. for all the good that might do us. Have Chem put out an APB on her - charge her with Criminal Mis-Use Of Magic for starters, and anything else that might stick, and make her Public Enemy Number One. With luck, maybe the Gendarmes can pick her up.. make sure it's noted that her magic is of the absolute highest class.. target is extremely dangerous.. and, of course, Lethal Force is authorized if necessary."

Webley: "I think that's about all we CAN do." She shook her head. "That or wait for her to pop up again." *Sigh* "I HATE that.."

K: "Ehh.. sometimes, Hero Mistakes are the only choices we can make. Sometimes, we get cornered. It happens. All we can do is take every precaution we can, and hope we get her before she gets us." I nodded.

Webley: "Oh, train's ready to run us all back to Canterlot." She nodded.

K: "Alright. Once everyone's fed and secured, let's load up and head back home. We need to plan for the Rainbow of Light.. that should be our next objective." I nodded.

Webley: "You got it." She nodded, and departed.

Well, now we had ANOTHER problem. An antagonist that would likely want revenge, and had the magical power to get it done in the worst ways. As I loaded up into the train, later, I reflected on what that might be. Stealing Celestia's mark? Assassination? Murder? Who knew. Trixie became a General for Tirek, and later fell so out of favor, that she was put in a position where suicide was a better option than suffering his wrath.

I just hoped she didn't shack up with Tirek. That would be an unimaginable nightmare.
