It's evening in Equestria.

You're on the couch, chilling, reading another Daring Do book (because there's fuck-all-else to do).

A knock at the door! Hm.. perhaps somepony is stopping by because they need a hand (because you have hands, they're handy, and this is a corny-as-fuck line).

Going over to the door, you brush off your jeans (Rarity knows denim, when she puts her mind to it - though you had to pluck off all the rough rhinestones) and flick an oat crisp fragment from your button-down shirt (okay, she did good here - it's a linen shirt, and it'd probably go for $50+ back home). No undershirt because you've become fairly ripped doing all the manual hand-labor that Ponies would need to use their mouths for, for the last two years.

You open the door.. and it's Fluttershy.

"This had better not be-" You start. Another Fetish attempt?

Fluttershy: "This has n-nothing to do with fetishes! Please! L-let me in.." You notice a small cage at her side, with a cloth cover over it. Since when does Flutters use cages?

"Alright, but if you try to rape me, I'm calling the Guards again." A sigh. She DID stop (mostly) about eight months ago.

Fluttershy: "N-no rape.. I-I promise." She comes in, getting her mouth around the cage's handle. Kicking the door shut behind her, she sets the cage on the table.

"What is this all about?" You shrug.

Fluttershy: "This.. is pretty serious.." She starts.. meeps.. and blushes a little. "Do you remember when.. I was.. mixed with that.. bat?" She starts, bashfully.

"Vaguely. You sucked apples." A snicker, as a thought of some erotic-but-hilarious R34 flashes across your mind.

Fluttershy: "Something.. happened.." She tugs at a free lock of her hair. "I.. should show you.." She summons up all her meager courage, and pulls the cloth from the small cage.

*HISSSS!!*

Inside is that troublesome rabbit.. her rabbit.. Angel Bunny. He's.. different, now. There are fangs where his buck teeth should be. His eyes are red, and sunken.. and his fur is all matted.. with red stuff. There's small red things in the cage with him. At first, you think he got into the tomatoes.. but then you smell the stench of coagulated blood. The scent of iron wafts to your nose..

..those aren't tomatoes.

"Fluttershy!" You gasp.. in honest shock. Not only is this not a fetish thing, this is fucking serious!

Fluttershy: *Whimper* "I-I don't know how it happened! It.. I just.." *Mumble*

"Fluttershy, you need to tell me everything.." *Firmly.* "NOW."

Fluttershy: "I-I was.. gathering food for some of the woodland creatures too frail to go gather their own.." Typical Fluttershy. "..and, when I came home, I couldn't hear the little birds any longer.. so.. so, I looked for Angel.. and I found him.." *Sob* "He was drinking them!"

"Important.. was the sun up, still, or already down?"

Fluttershy: "Down, but.. but.. this isn't the worst part..!"

*THUMP!*

"What the hell was that!?" You cursed aloud.. she didn't like it when you used mean words, but you'd had to use them some times to keep her at bay..

Fluttershy: "That's what I was trying to tell you!" *Whine!* "They're.. EVERYWHERE!"

"Well, fuck ME.." You snort, in frustration.

Fluttershy: "Uh.. Anon.. I don't think this is the right time for that.." She says offhandedly.

"Just an expression, Fluttershy. How many of them are there?" You shrug. "Where're the girls?"

Fluttershy: *SOB!* "THEY TURNED INTO THEM!" She throws herself on the floor, covering her face with her forelegs, and sobs.

"Right. Well. Time to get serious." You walk into your back room - it's a small place, but you have enough storage space to hide some of the more 'dangerous' human things you came to Equestria with.

Into the huge chest of dangerous human things, you gather up the items you'll need to combat this menace. As it happens, you're a huge Castlevania fan, and a general fan of the Vampire genre.

..of Vampire HUNTERS.. to be precise.

From the crate you pull your LBE (Load Bearing Equipment), and start getting it on. You've lost some gut size since you bought it, and it's loose at first. Digging in, you come up with a Pelican case, and get the key from around your neck.

More thumping outside. Can they smell your blood?

"Fluttershy! Get in here!" You order her. She might be the last Pony left in Ponyville.. and despite the rape attempts, you feel obligated to try and protect her neck.

Opening the Pelican case, you pull out your pride-and-joy..

A Pre-86 Heckler und Koch G3A3.. mit HK79 Granatwerfer und ZF-1 4x24 Zielfernrohr - that's a G3A3 Battle Rifle with HK79 Grenade Launcher and ZF-1 4-power by 24-mm reticule telescopic sight. But you just love uttering it in German, because muh superior H&K Engineering.

You start loading magazines.. you were a smart man, and you made sure to keep at least one loaded at all times. It went into the rifle, and you'd give the bolt the ol' HK Slap just as Flutters enters the room.

Fluttershy: "W-What is this!?" She implores you.

You set the rifle aside, and pull out your sidearm. An old Ace/Caspian Custom 1911 in .45 Super - you had no idea that Ace went out of business a few years ago, you've been here so long. Fortunately, you've plenty of ammo for it. It was built on a Para-Ordnance double-stack frame, giving you 14 + 1 rounds of Fuck You. This went into the crossdraw holster on your LBE, after racking the slide and putting the safety on. Just in case.

"Death." You utter, with reverence (and a hit of German accent, because muh H&K).

Fluttershy: "D-Death!?" She blinks. "It.. it can't be THAT bad! You.. you don't have to KILL them!" She gets the point about that, ever since you hacked a Timberwolf to death with an axe a few months ago.

*CRUNCH!* There goes your front door..

*HISSSSSSSS!!*

You can hear the vampires.. they're in the house. You grab Fluttershy and pull her down into the darkness that is your back room, hand over her muzzle, to keep her quiet. Not even a meep must escape her mouth.

Carefully, you reach over for the G3.. what were the rules at work, here? Were they even going to respond to bullets? You had standard 7.62x51mm M80 Ball loaded.. it was better than nothing at all. You move her over to one side, and use her body to brace the rifle so the barrel is sticking out of the crack in the door.

Twilight and Spike.. as vampires.. and Spike is sparkling..

..you feel rage at this, for reasons you cannot comprehend.

Headshots? That's supposed to be Zombie medicine, but it's all you've got. Assume they're still somewhat living. That they need their brains to function. Minus that, hip shots.. if they can't walk, they can't get you.. and horn/wing shots for the others..

You use irons.. at this range, it'll be hard to miss. You just hope your shooting skills haven't degraded that badly..

*P'CHOOM!*

Spike was hit in the neck, right at the base of the skull.. and he flopped down.. twitching. Twilight saw this, but doesn't seem to comprehend it. You target her right near the base of the horn (why do they twitch? Or is that you?).

*P'CHOOM!*

You see her horn shatter, and a geyser of blood come from the base of it.. she falls over.. twitching. Dead or not, she's down for the count.

Quickly, you load the rest of your mags, and mount them to your LBE. Letting Fluttershy go.. all she did was run over to Twlight's corpse and start crying. As expected. Perhaps she was too sensitive to deal with this level of carnage?

Too fucking bad - you were sure, somehow, this was all her fault.

Exiting your back room, you do a quick sweep before getting your EarPro in your ears.. and turning on that expensive GoPro camera you bought before you ended up here. You take some quick footage of the bloodbath, then shut it off and go to your kitchen to fetch your faithful Ka-Bar (you were a bit of a USMC Fanboy, and you got a sweet deal from some friends that work for CutCo), getting it into its sheath.

Fluttershy: "They.. I think.. they're dead.." *Whimper*

"Fluttershy... listen very carefully.." You start..

Fluttershy: "Yes?" A whine in her voice.

"If you want to live, you must come with me. Do what I say. And cry for them later." You threw in that last bit to, hopefully, placate her tears.. a little.

Fluttershy: "Alright.." Her head droops.. and you go over to your little anvil. "A-Anon..? Why.. the anvil?"

You wordlessly pick it up, and carry it over to the cage.

Fluttershy: *Whimper* All she can do is cover her eyes.

*CRUNCH!*

As you slam the anvil down on the cage, and smoosh Angel into a fine paste. At least he didn't suffer.. not that you shouldn't have subjected him to torturous experiments in the name of science, to see how to kill these things, after some of the shit he's put you through out of 'jealousy' for Fluttershy's initial affections for you.


Part II: Out into the town..


So, now, you've been wandering around for a bit, with Fluttershy, trying to get to either the library, or Rarity's place. You only have one way of dealing with these things - killing them - but perhaps a skilled Unicorn might reverse the spell? Who knows. And you only know one other decently talented Unicorn.. if she was still Pony, that is. If not, it'd be a long trek to see Princesses Moonbutt and Sunbutt and pray to {INSERT DIETY HERE} that they can Deus Ex Machina this whole thing.

Fluttershy: "A-Anon.. over there..!"

A group of Vampires.. they've cornered the Cakes. There's too many of them.. but you can clearly see Pinkie Pie is at the head of the gaggle of fang-faces. You can't quite make out the words, but you can hear the Cakes begging to be spared. You take a quick peek through your 4-power scope.. and you can see them trying to shield their little ones.

The pack descends upon them.. you can hear the gurgling screams.. two babies crying.. then one.. then none. Fluttershy buries her face in your armpit.. trying to keep herself from screaming, you imagine.

Well, fuck. They've gone from spreading their Condition (you're not sure if it's a viral pathogen, a magical spell, or what, so 'condition' seems appropriate) to simply feeding. That's bad. That means no mercy, no turning selected ones into Creatures of the Night.. just a blood orgy.

That meant you and Flutters would be hunted.

You have to pull her by the tail to get her to move, but you get her going.. and you head right for the Boutique. At this point, it was closer..

..back door. Yes. You stack up on the door, with Fluttershy behind you, and test the knob. They rarely locked these things, so you're shocked to find that it won't open. A hard kick, and the knob breaks away, allowing you to enter.

Blood. Blood everywhere.

You have to clamp your hand over Fluttershy's muzzle again, both to keep her from screaming, and to keep her from calling out for her friend.

Sweep and clear time.

Moving quickly, you transition from the bulky 20lbs+ Battle Rifle to the 1911, and as its dark, flick the tactical light on with a bit of pressure to the grip.

Too much tacticool? HAH! Who's laughing, now? You're the one with the gun, and-

Movement! Out of the corner of your eye, you saw it dash under the counter. Too small to be Rarity..

*Harsh Whisper* "Sweetie-Belle!"

*Quiet whimper*

*Harsh Whisper* "Sweetie-Belle! Come here!" It has to be her. You keep your 1911 in her general direction, just in case she's One Of Them. "We're not Vampires!" Safety off. No trust.

Out she comes.. bruised, but as far as you can tell, unbitten. She looks like she just got into a fight.

Fluttershy: "Sweetie-Belle!" She croaked, and zoomed over to her before you could stop her.

Sweetie-Belle: "AH! Flu-Fluttershy!? You're okay!" She squeaked as she was hugged. "Anon! Uh.. whut's with all the.. whut is all that?" She asks, confused.

"Things to make the Vampires die." You affirm.

Sweetie-Belle: "Ahh.. aw.." She cries.

"Where's Rarity?" You ask, both with concern and a tinge of fear.

Sweetie-Belle: "I.. I.." She could only point to the bedroom.

So, you go over and give it a look. There, on her expensive and gorgeous bed, is Rarity. Dressed in a provocative outfit. Come-hither-stare still on her face.

And a part of a hat rack embedded in her chest. She was dead. Staked through the heart. Okay, so, destroy the heart, destroy the vampire. Brain, too. And spine. Things are looking up - they CAN be killed!

"Sweeite." You start. Well, there goes any hope of having Rarity substitute for Purple Smarts.. "Sweetie, you need to come with us." How are you going to cover both of them? "Fluttershy, let her ride on your back.." You hope she has the stamina to pull that off.

You'd have to check the Library. With any luck, any luck at all, there wouldn't be anything in there that wants to suck your blood out.

"Come on." You motion for the girls to follow you. At the door, you transition back to the rifle.

Vampires.. they're going everywhere.. an orgy of killings.. you can hear the screams, the begging, the total lack of comprehension as innocent-hearted Ponies are exposed to violence on a scale they could never understand.

But you understand. You're Human. Violence is your very nature. Back from Caveman times, when Caveman had to bash Caveman over the head for food and wimminz. And right now, that Caveman side of you has flipped the Operator Switch. You were a machine. A killing machine. But this was no video game..

Stepping out into the back yard, you target a nearby vampire - it was once Roseluck. Double-tap to the side of the torso.. down it goes.

"Stay close!" You warn.

To the left. Another one - looks like Colgate got the ultimate dental work. You give her the ultimate lead mouthwash, as two 147gr. rounds slam into her muzzle, one going through the brain stem. Down.

Moving at a quick-but-careful pace, your eyes down the sights at all times, with flicks to either side to watch for threats, you manage to get back near the center of town. You can see the bloodbath clearly, now.. there's buildings burning everywhere. A cackle is heard.. and down swoops Rainbow Dash, with Daisy in her arms. Dash and Pinkie Pie gleefully leap upon Daisy, who screams and begs for her life.. only to be violently fed upon.

You ignore them. They're out of the immediate threat zone, and shooting them would get the attention of others.

Around the side of the tree, you get to the Library's front door. It's standing wide open. Transitioning again, you step foot inside, hearing Fluttershy catch up to you..


Part III: Library of Horrors


Father Waddle: "OH!" You hear his voice from the darkness, and have some watery liquid hit your face.

"Father Waddle?" You inquire, wiping it away. Your taclight illuminated him just as he threw the water, and you can see he has a bottle of some kind in his hoof.

Father Waddle: "Ah! Anon! Fluttershy! Sweetie-Belle!" He heaves a sigh of relief.

"Holy Water..?" You inquire.

Father Waddle: "Yes, Anon.." He nods solemnly.

"Does that actually work?" You hear Fluttershy set Sweetie-Belle down, off to the side.

Father Waddle: "It hurts them, and makes them go away.." He shrugs at you. "..that's all I require."

"For what?!" You shut the doors, and block them with a piece of heavy furniture that was conveniently there. "What's going on, here?"

Father Waddle: "Children of the Night, Anon.." He paces over to the book shelf that he had been looking at before you came in, and pulls down a large, tan tome.

"That's.. not the Necronomicon Ex Mortis, is it?" That would be too cliche.

Father Waddle: "No.. it's not. But it is a book of Necromancy." He sets it on a table. "What has happened here.." He shakes his head. "..I'm not sure. I do not know what was used to create these things.. but I do know how to stop them." He gives an affirming nod, his wrinkled face set in stone. "One wonders how, in this day and age, somepony could figure out how to make vampires.. and why.."

Fluttershy: "Uh.." She lowers her head.

"FLUTTERSHY!" You bellow at her, unable to contain your rage. "This was your doing, wasn't it!?" You stomp over to her.

Fluttershy: *Meep!* She cowers in place.

"Talk to me.." You grab her by the throat.

Father Waddle: "ANON!" He states, firmly. "Do not harm her!"

Fluttershy: "I-I.."

You can only point at Father Waddle in anger.. you know what this bitch has done.. you just know it.. time for a confession.

"Say it. Fucking SAY IT!" You demand.

Fluttershy: *Crying* "Vampires.. are.. vampires.. your fetish.. A-Anon!?" *BAWLING*

"I fucking knew it." You just let her drop to the ground. She offers no resistance. "YOU killed all those Ponies.. YOU did.. not me. YOU." You point at her. "How did you do it?!"

Fluttershy: "I-I.. I got.. I got.. Rarity to help with the spell.. I knew Twilight would figure out what I was trying to do.. I told Rarity it was a BEAUTY spell.. that.. that it would make me look beautiful to you!"

"You manipulated her. You manipulated her, and doomed all your friends." You point at her in disgust and anger. "You owe Sweetie-Belle an apology.. for killing her sister!"

Sweetie-Belle: "Th-This is all your fault!?" *Cries* "WHY!?"

Father Waddle: "ANON!" He huffed. "Enough! She may be at fault, but she will have to make penance for her sins, later! Now is not the time to torment her."

"Tell me a time. I'll be there." You snort. "How do we fix this, Father?" You calm down, your mind switching over to the task at hand.

Father Waddle: "Well.. there is a spell in here to send all of the Creatures of Darkness to The Void. Basically, to seal them away in nothingness. But.." He looks at Fluttershy, you and Sweetie-Belle. "Unlike the spell that apparently made them, this requires a virgin. A virgin mare." He nods. "They must speak this spell aloud, near the center of the infestation for it to be effective."

"YOU did this, you yellow bitch.. YOU fix it..!" You demand, pointing at her.

Fluttershy: *Mumble* "..not a virgin.."

"Oh, you WHORE!" You spit out, infuriated. "And all this time, you're chasing after ME!?"

Fluttershy: "I.. I kept imagining the stallions AS you, Anon! Always! All of them!" She sobs. "I WANT YOU INSIDE OF ME..!"

"..never. Not just no, not just HELL no.. but FUCK YOU for LIVING!" You storm at her. **Fucking Fluttershy.**

All she does is sob.

Sweetie-Belle: "Ah.. I can do it.." She sniffles.

Father Waddle: "It might kill you, too, young one." He says, putting a hoof on her shoulder.

Sweetie-Belle: "I've got nothing left to live for, anyhow.." She lowers her head.

That just made Fluttershy cry harder.

"Leave her. I'm done with her." You wave your hand at Fluttershy. "We have to get to the center of town. Father.. protect Sweetie-Belle." You grab the book and stuff it in your dump pouch. Safe enough place for it. Mag change on the G3. Just to be sure you're full.

Father Waddle: "Of course, Anon." He nods, with determination. "I'm right behind you." He looks to Fluttershy. "I would insist we take you with, Child, but.. we have to stop this."

Abandoned by the Priest.. that HAD to fuck with her.


Part IV: The Void


Out you all go, moving towards the center of town. Your eyes stay locked on the front sight.. you know a battle is coming, and your body is preparing you for it. Every fiber of your very being is alive, electrified, determined to survive this at any cost. So what if you left Fluttershy behind? This was all her fault, anyhow. If she died, fine, no more problems. Ever. And you'd nary shed a tear.

You in the lead, you pump rounds into Vampires that were once your friends.. you don't care anymore. They're not Ponies any longer, they're monsters. And the PTSD you'd have after this would give you an excuse to start on that ulcer and liver cancer you've been meaning to work on.

The G3 barks.. and down goes another.. you think that one might have been Dinky, but you're not paying attention any more.

"The center of town is just ahead." You say, coolly.

Father Waddle: "You seem.. unusually attuned-"

"Dark secret, Father. Humans are violent creatures. This is nothing, to us. Surviving is something we do every day. Maybe not so-" *P'CHOOM-P'CHOOM!* "-directly, but we do survive. We fight each other for water, land, and faith. We fight for the sake of fighting. I thought I left all that behind.." A shrug, as you pivot over and take out a dark blue-green stallion. "..skill at violence is a terrible gift."

Father Waddle: "Right now, I'm glad for it.." He says, with a tone of regret.

You reload, quickly, applying the HK Slap to the G3.

"I'm sorry, for that." Regret. Isn't that typical of a human? Go and fuck something up, in the process of saving it, and you have regrets for your actions? It's the one thing that separates Man from Monster. Compassion.

Sweetie-Belle: "Ah.. Anon.." She's between you and Father Waddle. "Whatever happens.. thank you.." She gently tapped the side of her head to your thigh.

"For what?" You pivot again, and take out what you think might have been Graphite.

Sweetie-Belle: "At least, now, I gets a chance to do something important!" She offers a weak smile. "Maybe.. I'll.. finally get my Cutie Mark?" A hopeful grin.

"Maybe." You're almost there.

Rainbow Dash lands before you.. she's grown powerful with all the blood she's consumed, her wings very bat-like.. her eyes like hot coals.

Vampire Dash: "Ma-hahahaha!" *HISSSSSSSSSS!* "Young and tender! Just how I like them!"

"To think.. I wanted to cum inside that.." You mutter, mainly to yourself.. "HEY! SKITTLE-BRAIN! OVER HERE!" You yell, to get her attention. "Father, cover Sweeite, get that spell started." You push them ahead and to the side. "YEAH, YOU! I BET I CAN KILL YOU IN TEN SECONDS FLAT!" You taunt her Skittle-Mane'd ego..

Vampire Dash: "HAH! That'll be the day!" She sneers.. and lunges for you, wings out.

You let go of the G3, hands whipping to your chest. Fingers grasp the 1911, and you bring it out ahead of you, just in time to mag-dump the loud, thunderous 15 rounds of .45 Super into the incoming cyan pony, rapidly tugging the competition-tuned trigger, until the slide locks back. Never has your aim been so steady - Adrenaline is a wonderful thing.

The mass of cyan vamp-pony tumbles over, and crashes.. sliding to a stop at your feet. Not committing a Hero's Mistake - just standing there like a dumbshit - you swiftly reload, and 360 threat-scan.. transitioning back to the rifle, and opening the Grenade Launcher tube.

$200 a pop.. that's just the Tax Stamp.. you only had six of them, and you WERE saving them for something special, like a Destructive Devices shoot, or that one piece of shit car your friend has (and the Quarry - the only safe place you had to light one of these things off). M386's - HE with a fragmenting effect. Loading this, you pull the launcher tube shut.

They were coming.. loads of them. You flipped the fire selector to Full Retard mode - Full Automatic. If you were going down, to fix one of Fluttershy's little stunts, you were going to take as many of these fuckers with you, as possible.

"Father!" You call out.

Father Waddle: "We're starting the spell! Protect us!"

Never have you been more sure of anything in your former neckbeardy life.

And why? For friends that were now vampires? Or because you have a need to redeem yourself? Why risk your life like this? Any good horsepussy in this town - if you're into that - is long dead or turned. It's not for sexual reward.. no.. you're risking your life for some other reason. Why, then?

They start to come out of the woodwork.. their Vampiric forms illuminated by the firelight.. you pick a good spot, and dig in. Behind an overturned apple cart. Irony.. the first thing you ate upon coming here. You brace the hefty rifle, and start picking your shots. Last Stand at the Alamo time..

..a gaggle of six of them, approaching Waddle and Sweeite, about twenty feet away from you. You pivot, hoping the shrapnel avoids them, and depress the flat trigger bar on the HK79. The grenade fires with a *THOOMPTH!* and strikes the side of a building, right over them. The grenade explodes a moment later, sending death upon them. Or, at least, crippling injury.

You haven't time to reload the grenade launcher - you pivot and start firing again, the rifle barking loud and clear - almost as if it's reveling in a chance to perform its intended function. To kill, in order to protect. Poetically.

Dry magazine. You pull a fresh one, and hit the mag release.. only to be hit in the side by Pinkie Pie. She tackled you out of nowhere..

Vampire Pie: "AHAHA! Anon.. I always wondered if you TASTED as SWEET as you LOOKED!" Her jaw comically snapping open and shut, a vampiric baby gator in her hair, mimicking her actions..

Punches.. hard, rapid punches.. until you can get your knife out. Your left forearm in her throat, trying to block her. The Ka-Bar grabbed, you go to stab her in the neck.. only to have that vampiric gator try to bite your hand.

Not that he has any teeth, but still..

"GEDDOFF ME!"

Fluttershy: "GET OFF OF HIM!" She sailed into Pinkie Pie, slamming her into the ground.

No time to think.. you grab the magazine you dropped, and slam it home, administering a harsh HK Slap and wheeling over to see Pinkie Pie biting the ever-loving shit out of Fluttershy. Flat on the ground, you aim for Pinkie's head, and fire. Three shots.. and she's dead.

You get up.. you can see clouds starting to gather in the sky, forming some kind of a vortex. And walk over to Fluttershy.

Her neck was bitten open in several places. There's blood.. everywhere.

"Ah, Fluttershy.. Fuck.." Regret.

Fluttershy: *Hagn..* "Is.. is.. d-death.. your fe-fetsih, Anon?" A weak smile.. a joke.

"No, Fluttershy, it isn't." You bow your head for just a moment, but that's all they needed.

A gang of them, now.. they've tackled you.. they're all over you.. you punch and kick and scream.. you know this is the end.

You can feel the wind.. wind picking up as you fight with every last drop of fear and anger to keep those teeth away from you.

The spell! THE SPELL!

The wind goes from a light breeze, to a hurricane torrent in seconds. You can now see Vampires being sucked up.. pulled.. and the ones atop you are soon to join them.

They're all consumed.. all of them.. pulled into the swirling vortex.. you can feel yourself being pulled, too.. were you bitten? No.. you don't see any blood..

..did "All the Creatures of the Darkness" mean humans, too?

Fuck no. You were not going to DIE after all THIS shit. Slamming yourself to the ground, you crawl away from the vortex, using your Ka-Bar to knife the ground in defiance.. finally reaching the side of a building, you throw your arms around an exterior support beam, and lock your hands. And hold on.

The wind pulls on you.. taunting you.. enticing you to just give up. But you refuse.

Though.. you do eventually black out from lack of oxygen - it's very hard to breathe when your face is in the wind like this.

The storm rages for what feels like hours.. and then.. it stops. You awaken.. wobbly.. grasping your G3 and walking over to where Waddle and Sweetie had been. They were gone.

Fluttershy was gone. They were ALL gone..

..all gone. You were the last one left alive. Surveying the destruction, you see that the Vortex put out the fires, but also consumed a huge chunk of the town. Buildings, roads, lamp posts.. everything.. all gone.

Trudging back to your cottage.. your adrenaline spent.. you wonder.. was it all worth it?

Several hours pass.. you're sure that you're the only one alive..

Applejack: "HEY! ANON!"

You sit bolt upright, 1911 aimed at the source of the noise. And there stands Applejack and Big Mac with several Royal Guards. It's daylight. The long night is over.

Applejack: "WHUT in TARNATION happened here!? Everything's all destroyed! An' I can't find no one!"

"Ah.. A-J.. you.. wouldn't believe me if I told you.." You shrug. "Let's just say Fluttershy tried one of her harebrained schemes, again, and she destroyed the town in the process, hm?" A weary grin. "I need booze."

And probably a very, very long sleep...
