Between the time I started writing, and the time my life allowed me to write again, I lost access to my DA account where I had all of this carefully archived. I apologize to my OC contributors for not taking extra precautions, for the contributor's names I've lost, and can no longer credit.

NOTE (06/27/2024): I went ahead and made a new DA account to track down as many of my old comrades as possible, and have updated this list.


NEW GUEST STAR OC CAST:

-Blizzardly Snowbound by "Silnu"

-Seven Devils by "Tennyokage"

-"Olivine Ellva" by "ColtZero"


These are the OC's added after Chapter 100.




SPECIFIC CHAPTERS AUTHOR'S NOTES:

Chapter 0/Orignal Autor's Note:

This is the original Dream, as originally posted on 4chan /mlp/, and why I use the name Dreamlander. This is unaltered, except for fixing spelling errors.

Congrats, /mlp/, you sick bastards did this to me. I swear. The only times I come here is to get Pinkie Pie pics, for my wife's friend.. and started watching on her recommendation. Then, a few days ago, I had a nightmare of epic proportions.. mixed with some better parts.

Before I get to the horror that you gave me, I feel it's important to explain that I have a long history of especially realistic dreaming. To the point that I can taste, touch, smell, read, hold conversations, and see things I've never seen before. Take that as you will. Now, the dream.

(Oh, and, you know who you are!)


Chapter 6 Author's Note:

I always have a fascination with 'background characters' or other 'second line' identities in fictions - they always seem to have interesting, untold stories. So, here's a story about Derpy and some of HER friends.


Chapter 7 Author's Note:

This is NOT strictly fanservice to those that headcannon some obsession of Lyra with Humans [though that is a big part of it], it also internally retcons the existence of Generation 1


Chapter 10 Author's Note:

This was originally written shortly into Season 1, and was intentionally written as a "Happy Ending" for the various "ScootAbuse" threads often seen on /mlp/ and is a product of its time.


Chapter 11 Author's Note:

The first several chapters were setting the stage. Now, you have your war.


Chapter 16 Author's Note:

Inspired by deathfromabov, who has my thanks for the inspiration, even if this doesn't turn out exactly how he hoped.


Chapter 39 Author's Note:

This is where I originally stopped writing in 2012/2013 or so, halfway through Part 3. I finished up to Chapter 42 or so, after that, before picking it back up again in 2019.



OTHER IMPORTANT NOTES:

-The main character, "K," does not know what the Equestrian calendar is, until Chapter 38. While calendar dates are provided sparsely up until that point, be aware that the main character DOES NOT know what they are, until he's specifically told. The in-universe calendar is provided for the Reader to have a sense of time passage, and understand the relation between dates and events.
