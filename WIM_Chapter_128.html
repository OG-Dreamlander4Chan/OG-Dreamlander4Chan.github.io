Part 1: Flock Dock

TIME: 06:23 GMT
DATE: War Day 992/23 Lunaris, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Weston Super Mare, North Summerset, Ambleon


We were stretching our legs. The train arrived at 5AM, and we had loads of books and things along with us. I decided - for security reasons - we'd embark on the Fleet and make for Dublin as soon as possible. We'd study the books and things along the way. The sea trip would take a day.

We'd figured out, so far, that Ambleon probably contained more secrets than we'd found so far. We'd have to have NEIGHTO Intel and Magic experts go over everything with a fine tooth comb. The books and things at Cirencester Magical College were simply handed to us by the staff, once they heard what had happened to us so far.

Tellingly, three members of the Staff also surrendered to turn Crown Evidence against other Supremacists, after the bombing a few days ago. It seemed they were just fine with taking over, but drew the line at Terrorism. Befitting their Ambler roots - they were Gentlecolts and Ladies of refinement, they had standards.

Broken: "..an' I'm shocked t'be findin' so much more about Philosophy than I thought.." He said, pacing up to me, and partially giving a report.

K: "I'm glad, Broken. I have a feeling they were trying to tell us something, back then. Stuff we forgot." I shrugged.

Mary: "Aye!" She beamed a grin. "I's'o fascinatin'!"

Oh, uh.. Mary.. and her sister.. were along with us. They were technically witnesses. Mary was originally from Dundalk, Ironland. She'd come over as a teenager in response to an ad in the paper, looking for a maid. Her younger sister came with as well - her mother was in Dundalk being cared for. They were frighteningly poor, as a result of the Ambleonian take over. Her grandfather had owned a lot of land, that was seized by the Ambleonian crown, leaving them in dire straits. This job was Mary's lifeline.

Then, Havastaff altered the deal. She was a gifted Mage - a Lunar/Air type, no less. Perfect to imitate a ghost. Havastaff had massive gambling debts, but was a "society pony" that had to keep up his appearances. Hence, the thefts. The Gloucestershire Police Service and Shetland Yard were working to recover the stolen goods.

Willow Spectra: "So's, whar we goin' affer this, sis!?" Willow, her little sister, was 12.

Mary: "Mm.. back't'Ironland, I think." She looked over at me.

K: "Yes, that's our next destination. And a safe place for you two. I'll see to it that you're properly provided for, and we get some medical help for your mom." I shrugged. "You're a witness in the case against Captain Havastaff, and according to you, at least one of his intermediaries was a Camel." I pointed out.

Broken: "Ah'll look after her, K." He nodded, firmly. "Both'a them."

I noticed that.. Broken's accent was somewhat transitory - as expected of someone educated by high society Ambleonians, but coming from an Ironish background. When he got intensely emotional, his Ironish accent faded, and his "Received" accent kicked in. I knew someone from Earth that was like this, in reverse - they spoke with little discernable accent most of the time, but piss her off, and her Southern accent kicked in, hard.

My wife. J--.

To be honest, it was.. a bit of a turn on.

K: "I know you will." I nodded. "Ever been here before, Broken? Golden?" I looked at them both.

Broken: "Nah." He shrugged.

Golden: "Nah, mate." He frowned.

K: "Well, I want breakfast.." I scrunched my nose, feeling my harem slide up around me. "..and I think they do, too."

Steela: "Yes! Breakfast nice." She nodded a bit.

Willow: "Oooo! Ah knows whaer there's'a guut breakfast! Mary'n'me been 'ere b'fore! B'fore Havastink got all mean'n'stuffs." She soured her nose at the thought.

Mary: "Aye. Issa fine breakfast shoppe, down that'a'ways." She nodded to the street ahead.

Dusk: "Sounds wonderful - someone's famished." He smirked.

Rarity: "We both are." She nudged him. "Come on, now, darlings. Let's go eat."


TIME: 09:12 GMT


We were at this little bakery type shop, which served nice breakfasts. They had a local take on the Cornish Pasty that I'd been very eager to try - it was made with lamb on one side, and some kind of berry jelly on the other. It was what, on Earth, would be called a "Tin Miner's Pasty."

Most everyone was having vegetable or cheese pastys. I had to admit, the bite carefully fed to me by Applejack was.. especially good. It was made from Stilton cheese and some apple bits.

I was finishing my tea when a Royal Ambelonian Navy officer trotted in at a clip.

Cdr. Focus Deep: "Commander Focus Deep, sire. HMAS Inflexible." He bowed to us, saluted, and stood to attention. "Th' admiral reports we're ready to convey your party to Ironland, sir. Your own surface battle groups are in harbor and ready to depart."

K: "Well met, Commander." I saluted back. "Understood. We'll be ready shortly." I nodded. "Hear that, everyone? The Navy is ready! Finish up, and let's get ready to go."

Over on the side, I caught sight Broken and Mary looking at each other over a half-finished pasty.. and Willow snatching it while they were distracted.

Applejack nudged me.

I didn't need nudging. I saw it.

K: "Commander, get yourself a cup of tea while we finish up." I nodded. "You happen to be related to Duncan Deep? From Cobneticut?"

Cdr. Focus Deep: "Ah.. he's a cousin, sir." He nodded. "And thank you, I shall." He trotted over to the counter to get a cup of tea.

It took everyone a little bit. I was keeping an eye on Broken, though. It was cute, seeing him talk to Mary, with Willow by her, chattering away, too, innocently.

Once we finished breakfast, we headed for the docks. Weston Super Mare was a resort town - it had a resort dock to match. We picked this since no one would expect us to embark on the fleet, here. As nothing dastardly happened, it seemed my guess was right. It took a bit for the ferries to get us all aboard, but we soon were.

Now, off to Ironland..

[End of Part 1]

Part 2: Make Sail

TIME: 17:44 GMT
DATE: War Day 992/23 Lunaris, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: HMS Weather Rock, Celtic Sea


I was seated in the CAG flag and command staff area with everyone. Most were looking over documents found in Ambleon. Some were relaxing. Moon Dancer had, again, worked herself to exhaustion and was asleep with a half-finished letter to her Griffon boyfriend.

Griffon boyfriend. Almost a year ago, she tried to shoot me for stepping on her property. Now, she was as experienced as any of us, and far less doughy. So much so, she had to get a new sweater in Ambleon - smaller, but otherwise identical.

Watching these ponies grow and change with the war was something special. I started out with nothing. I gained a Squad. I lost one of my first. I nearly lost another. We fought battles with tiny numbers of troops. We climbed mountains. Through it all, though, we remained friends and gained new ones.

It struck me that two of the Elements had been replaced already. Sunset for Twilight. Toola for Pinkie. Right now, Toola was doing a little stand-up routine (while laying down) and entertaining some of the girls. So many had gotten married, too. Myself. Gaze. Dex. Dusk. More.

I suddenly felt tense, though. I could feel the Sword of Rainbow's Light.. almost talk to me.

I stood up.

K: "...Dusk, radio the bridge. Sound General Quarters." I said, suddenly leaping from my seat, and moving to the exit.

Dusk: P> "Bridge, Staff HQ. Sound General Quarters. All crew to battle stations." He saw me head out.. I could hear him follow me.

PA: "ALL HANDS, THIS IS THE CAPTAIN! GENERAL QUARTERS! ALL CREW TO BATTLE STATIONS!"

The klaxon and ship's bell started clanging. I made my way to the stairs leading up to the bridge. As I did so, I could feel the ship gently start to rock just a bit more.

I didn't know what this was.. but there was SOMETHING here.

At the last second, before ascending the stairs to the bridge tower, I ran out the port side door, and ran along the deck past the 25mm and then 40mm gun emplacements, to the deck next to the forward dual 5-inch gun.

The sea was angry.

Something was very wrong.

I hadn't realized it, but Toola had followed me.

Toola: "..you feel it too, don't you?" She said, hauntingly.

K: "I don't know what -IT- is, but.." I paced to the hatch next to the gun, opened it, and went down.

Down to the main deck. Then forwards.. past the 40mm emplacement.. past the 16-inch guns.. all the way forwards..

Toola was right behind me.

I was at the very edge of the main deck, right where the bow swept up as a wave breaker. I put my hand on the hull.

Something.

A spine in the water, a spike the size of an 8-inch naval rifle barrel, swished past us.

A row of them.

Toola: "Master of the Seas.." She blinked.

K: "..Leviathan." I said, coldly.

Toola: "I-It's impossible! It CAN'T BE!" She CLUNG to me.

K: C> "BRIDGE, ALL STOP! REVERSE ENGINES! WHOLE FLEET, STOP RIGHT HERE! TAKE NO ACTION WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT ORDERS!" I called into my head set.

Capt. Northern Star: C> "A-Aye, sir! Understood!"

K: C> "Zephyr, this is General K! What's the status of the Daybreaker Device?" I said, firmly.

Capt. Tomato Fields: C> "Daybreaker Device is secured, safety on, and inactive."

K: C> "Remove safety and activate the device. Do not set the timer. Detonate it ONLY if this thing kills me - if it gets me, we're ALL dead, anyway. Understood?" I leaned on the edge of the hull.

Capt. Tomato Fields: C> "Acknowledged." There was fear in her voice.

K: C> "Twilight - GET SPIKE UP HERE, NOW!" I said, as the tail of the gigantic creature flipped itself gracefully out of the water, and flicked a little water.

It started to rain.. the clouds had been white and fluffy before, they were grey and angry now..

Twilight didn't question me - neither did Spike. Neither did Smolder, but she backed up her man, anyway. They ALL THREE ran up on deck.. right over to me. Twilight was.. terrified. So was Spike and Smolder.

Leviathan's head emerged from the waters.. it was larger than all of our Carriers combined.

Our naval guns would be nothing to him. Nothing. Fleas, at best.

He stared at us.. each in turn.. glaring at us. Then, focusing on me.

Of course.

Leviathan: "..you. You are the one."

K: "I am General K of Equestria!" I held my arms WIDE out. "I mean you no harm, Leviathan!"

Leviathan: "Even if you did. You could not." His voice was as deep as rumbling thunder, it reverberated through my body like a shockwave. Even the deck planks jiggled.

K: "What.. can we do for you, O' King of the Seas?" I gestured a bit.

Leviathan: "I have need of your services. As a Primordial, I cannot live on this plane for long." He looked at Spike. "But, I can.. be summoned. My mighty waves and winds can decimate nations! But.. even I.. am nothing compared to the one we both detest." He looked back to me.

K: "Tirek." I nodded.

Leviathan: "YEEEEEEEEEEEES!" He yelled out, and everything shook, waves crashed over the side of the Weather Rock, soaking us. "THE MONSTER! HE KILLED.. MY SON!"

I blinked..

..no.

K: "S-Steven!?" I.. I could feel the tears. I remembered how.. how he died.

Leviathan: "Yes." He calmed himself. "How.. did he die."

K: "Not well, Lord Leviathan. Tirek.. made him suffer.. I am so sorry." I shook my head. "We buried him respectfully." I bowed a bit.

Leviathan: "THAT mercy.. is the ONLY reason.. I do not FLOOD this world.." He lowered himself so that he was but inches from me. "You.. ponies.. and human.. and dragon.. showed my dear son mercy and love." He slowly shook his massive head. "For that, I am ever grateful. But, be warned! Tirek's power is greater than you think! The wounds you have given him?! But scratches! SCRATCHES!" He growled. "The power of the Rainbow of Darkness is far more than the mere TASTE that my friend The Elevated Eminence was able to resist.." He bowed his head a little. "I see you grow your power. Promise me, now, that I will have a part in this revenge, and I.." He looked at Spike. "..shall grant you my power."

Spike: "H-How?" He blinked, resting a hand on Leviathan's jaw. "I'm.. just a teenage dragon."

Leviathan: "HEAR ME! Mortals.." He nodded to Spike and let Spike pet him. "I can grant you the power to Summon me at will. Be warned, my destruction is great. Call me only in the most extreme situations. I shall wash thine enemies away in a great torrent! Of wind and waves.." He nodded again to Spike. "What say you?"

Spike: "Any way I can.. I want to help. I want to stop Tirek. I-I.." He looked at Smolder. "..I've found the one I want to spend all the rest of my life with, and I want us to live a LONG time.. in peace. Help us. And I will help you wash away Tirek." He nodded, with determination.

Leviathan nodded, and grinned in return.

Leviathan: "So be it!" He raised up. "Call me when you need, little Spike. And human..?" He looked to me.

K: "Yes." I nodded.

Leviathan: "You will need the assistance of my other children - the Sea Ponies. Soon. Take this." He flicked an amulet from his jaw, and I caught it. "It will identify you as my ally. They will accept you without question. Lead them well."

K: "I will, Leviathan." I bowed to him.

With that, he slowly sank beneath the waves.. and soon was gone. The sun came out, the clouds receded.. and all was calm once again.

Time: 17:22 GMT

Twilight: "How does this sound, K?" She smirked at me.

K: "Go for it." I nodded, also grinning like a Cheshire cat.

Twilight: "Dear Princess Celestia. It's been a long time since I sent you a progress report on the Magic of Friendship. I have something to report, now, that can't be covered in a military after-action report. I made a new friend today. He's strong, a great swimmer, and very different from us. He was scary at first, but I found out we have a common struggle. Through that, and through Spike's magic, we were able to find a bond. He's promised to help us in the future, when we need him most. Oh, his name? His name is Leviathan. Ever your faithful student, Twilight Sentry." She giggled.

K: "Sounds great." I nodded. "Spike? Do the honors?" I gestured.

He did, lighting the flame and burning off the letter.

The response came a few minutes later.

"Dearest Twilight.

WHAT?!"

[End of Part 2]

Part 3: Sham Rock

TIME: 14:22 GMT
DATE: War Day 993/24 Lunaris, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Dublin, Ironland, Ambleon

Coming to port, finally, we were greeted by what I thought we'd see, ever since the terrorist attack.

Protestors.

"NEIGHTO OUT OF IRONLAND"

"NO NEIGHTO OCCUPIERS"

"RESIST"

"FIGHT UNJUST OCCUPATION"

"RESTORE THE THRONE"

That and flags - blue ones, with a shamrock-over-harp on it. Intermixed with green banners. The crowd was at least a few hundred. The local Dublin Police Service and Dublin Home Guard were holding the protestors back.

It was NOT a pretty sight. I had a feeling this was going to end up happening, as I said.

I also did not have Forest Spirit with me. And for good reason - he'd only inflame the passions of those that wanted independence immediately, and draw a target from those that refused it.

We were still aboard the Weather Rock - the security situation was being handled, and at the moment it was on the verge of a riot. So, it wasn't safe to disembark.

We'd been waiting for over three hours, at this point.

K: "Admiral, signal Dublin. Contact the local Home Guard commander and inform them that I'm willing to meet peacefully with the leaders of this protest." I nodded softly.

VADM Whitecap: "Aye, sir." A shrug. "Wouldn't that look like you were granting them some legitimacy?"

K: "Yes, but, there's also the fact that we can't conduct our investigation until the protest is dealt with, and time is not on our side, at the moment. So.. either I talk.. or the Home Guard and Police have to get violent.. which is exactly what the forces behind the protestors want." I nodded back.

VADM Whitecap: "Ah. Understood, sir." And they'd gesture to the communications station.

PO2 Sparkly: "Already on the horn, Admiral." She nodded.

Capt. Northern Star: "Eh.. I suppose this was going to happen sooner or later, K." She drooped a little. "After hearing what Forest said.." And frowned.

I stepped over to her, and gave her a hug. In any other military, this would be a major breach of decorum. In a pony military, this was -expected.-

K: "Hey, we made it this far, right?" I fixed her cap.

Capt. Northern Star: "Aye-Aye, sir." She smiled a bit. "I hope we can fix this without.." She leaned her head aside. "..hurting more of our own kind."

K: "Tirek's a master of emotional manipulation. Besides raw power, he's VERY smart. Maybe even smarter than me?" I tilted my head. "But, we can't let that stop us. We have something stronger than hate: Friendship. And love. Right?"

Capt. Northern Star: "We sure do, K." She smiled widely.

I'd meet with them. If they weren't Tirek Agents (I doubted this), they might listen to reason.


TIME: 15:14 GMT


We were in the Dockmaster's Office. It was large, private, and it afforded me neutral ground. Seated before me were 12 ponies that each represented a different faction involved in the protest. They had no single leader. My crew was bringing them tea and snacks.

I was also, more or less, alone. No other CAG were with me - especially not Twilight or Raven.

K: "Gentlecolts and Ladies." I nodded to each of them. "I asked you here because I want to talk. If you think you know me, then you should know well that I am a diplomat first. I talk. I solve problems. I find common ground." I gestured a bit.

Patty O'Stones: "Aye, suhr." He was a large, grizzled, slightly unkempt stallion. "Is why we'd agreed't'this." And nodded to me.

K: "Good." I sat down, and accepted tea from a Petty Officer. "Now. Any one of you want to speak up first?"

Steely O'Tool: "Ahye do." She was a very fierce young mare, strong built, with a firey copper mane and tail, with a light tan coat. "Ah'm Steely O'Tool. Ah repremzents th' Ladies Textile Workers'a Northern Ironland." She leaned over the table. "Mai worry's fer th' marefolk'n'foals." She nodded at me. "Th' war'z been terrible. S'many'a th' stallions been marched off'ta feight." She shook her head. "We's werried if they'd be comin' back're not.. an' what'll happ'n if they doesn't."

K: "I.. I get that." I nodded, looking down at my tea. "I have a family, too." I looked her in the eye, softly. "I can't guarantee they all will, Miss O'Tool. I can, however, guarantee that every soldier that leaves behind a family, can be assured - with Equestria's own money if needed - that their family will be taken care of." I shook my head a bit. "No foal will go hungry. No wife will be in need. No matter what that eventually means. But, understand, if they don't go.. if they don't fight.." I shrugged. "..if Tirek wins, the foals won't go hungry very long. The Porcine will eat them." I flared my nostrils a bit. "The wives won't have to worry for need - they'll be enslaved. The lucky ones, at least."

This.. kinda took the wind from her sails a bit, and she sat back down.

McBurger: "I'm Shameless McBurger." A suited, middle aged stallion near the end of the table piped up next. "I represent a constituency across several counties. We're against NEIGHTO being used as occupation troops."

K: "And they never will be." I pointed at him. "No foreign soldier will ever step foot on Ironish soil with the objective of occupation or subjugation. I can't control Ambleonian internal affairs, but I will.. ABSOLUTELY.. assure and affirm that NEIGHTO is not a force for occupation in any way. We will never let this alliance be used to outsource troops for member nations' internal matters. Ever. My world.. toyed with this idea, but quickly realized it was a bad one. That doesn't mean other supranational organizations didn't do it anyway, but my world's NEIGHTO analogue, did not. And never would. It's an alliance for external defense, not internal policing." I shook my head. "And all of my most senior officers understand this. CAG understands this. The assistant SAC understands this. None will ever let it happen, even if I'm gone after Tirek is destroyed."

He contemplated my words, and sat down, nodding to me with approval.

Gorge Fairlane: "Gorge Fairlane, sire." From the other end of the table - he was in some very vague sort of uniform-like tunic, and trousers. Dark chestnut with chromes. Black mane and tail. "I.. represent the True Ironish Royal Army." He gestured with a hoof. "Very risky that I show my face around here." He looked at the doors. "I'm a wanted stallion."

K: "I get that." I nodded to him.

Gorge Fairlane: "Our.. movement.. seeks the restoration of the Ironish Throne." He shrugged slightly. "I should adamantly point out that it was not our people that attacked you in South Cave."

K: "You are, however, prepared to be violent." I stated.

Gorge Fairlane: "If absolutely necessary." He shrugged slightly.

K: "Again, I can't directly interfere in Ambleonian internal matters. I also can't speak for all the members of the exiled royal family, but I can speak for one - Commandant Forest Spirit has adamantly refused to take up this cause. He sees himself as Equestrian, and Texan, not Ironish, and certainly not Royalty." I shrugged. "This is also why I didn't bring him with - I knew someone, here, would want an audience with him. Or, worse, that someone might try to kill him, for what he represents."

Gorge Fairlane: "My.. opposite number over here.. Silas Greene.. wants a.. non-royal form of government.." He shrugged, gesturing to the man next to him, dressed more commonly.

Silas Greene: "Meself an' mister Fairlane represent.. ohhh.. a great many ponies that want Ironland free'a Amblers." He shrugged.

K: "I can't do anything about that - and if I did, I would be committing the sin I spoke of earlier, in reverse." I pointed out. "I will, however, ask Princess Margaret if a referendum can be held.." I pointed to both of them. "..AFTER the war.." I nodded. "..for Ironish independence. County by county, was my plan, with volunteer police and Gendarmes personnel specifically from Equestria and Prance only, assuring a fair and free vote." I shrugged wide. "But, as I said, I can only suggest. I can't force anyone to do anything."

Silas Greene: "An' if she dinnae agree?" He shook his head a bit, leaning forwards.

K: "Then, as I said before, NEIGHTO troops will not take part in whatever happens next. I would hope you can find some avenue of peace, but if there's violence, I won't allow a single soldier to be sent in to stop it. It'll be between you and the Ambleonian crown." I shook my head slowly. "As I once warned CAG, this exact thing happened in my world. Ireland and England, there. Ireland won most of its island back, but not all of it, and it led to 60 years of low intensity terrorism on both sides. This capped off over four hundred years of conflict. It.. was.. terrible on both sides." I frowned and sighed. "But, it would be a grave sin if I allowed NEIGHTO to intervene either way. NEIGHTO is for the protection of all, from any outside threat. That's it. It's a shield.. and that must be respected by all."

Silas Greene: "I see ye point." He frowned. "About the South Cave incident.." He started. "..t'was a gaggle of my colts what done it. Some muckity-muck come 'round an' told us if we offed ye an' pitched in wi' Orghuz, they'd help throw the Amblers out." And frowned. "I sez it wuzzint time fer'at yet. They dinnae listen." And sighed heavily. "Me.. me own son was.." And he looked down. "..but don't mistake me grief fer an unwillin'ness t'feight, if I has to."

K: "I would never." I nodded. "For the moment, you must all understand, we're here to stop Tirek. That's it. After that's handled, we can see about winning the peace, as well." I gestured to all of them. "This war has already called on far too many to sacrifice everything. I remember them, you know? I see their faces. I promise you, I will end this war however I can, and I will work hard to bring as many ponies home, alive and well, as I can possibly manage." I frowned a bit. "One of your own - a stallion named Broken Dawn - asked me why I do it? You probably have the same question. I'm an alien to you." I chuckled, derisivley. "I do this because I'm driven to. This is a world that's naturally at peace. I will do anything to preserve that. Because I can't stand to see my friends hurting. Because this positive place cannot be given over to negativity and death. Because all of you have every right to love and be happy.. because I believe in these things. I'm asking you, now, please.. put aside your fears for just a while longer. Unite with me. Know that I would die at any moment if it meant undoing all this hurt. Back me up - help me get the tools I need to end this with as little bloodshed as I can manage." I shook my head at them. "I can't do this if there's fighting going on, behind me. I can't do this.. without you."

My words had an impact on them. They all agreed that - until the war was over - they would work with their ponies and clubs and groups to make things run as smoothly as possible. They all extracted a promise from me that I'd speak to Princess Margaret personally about the situation. Likewise, they agreed to let the chips fall where they may.

It wasn't perfect, but it was better than nothing, and certainly better than riots and violence.

Part 4: Over the Hills

TIME: 11:07 GMT
DATE: War Day 994/25 Lunaris, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Dublin, Ironland, Ambleon


We finally got to disembark from the ship. As a sign of trust, I specifically asked Gorge Fairlane's TIRA and Silas Greene's Ironish Republic Army to guard our hotel.

The local Home Guard commander, an Ambleonian officer named Major Rockslides, objected. Vehemently.

Dusk.. made sure he knew where to stick his objections. This not out of an overt trust of the locals, but a trust in me to make the right choice.

Gorge: "I'm pleased you think you can trust us." He shrugged. "This must've been a tough choice to make."

K: "It was. But, I wanted to show the elements in Ironland that are against Ambleon, that NEIGHTO itself is not their enemy." I gestured, as I moved over to the small bar in my state room.

Gorge: "I think they understand, now." He nodded a bit to me. "My grandfather, ye know, was the last Majordomo to the King." He shrugged. "So, the Royalists sort of elected me as their leader."

K: "I see." I nodded to him. "What was his name?"

Gorge: "Septimus Fairlane." He stood proud.

K: "Interesting." I smiled a bit. "I bet he was a real dependable sort of stallion."

Gorge: "The best, Sir K." He nodded to me.

Broken: "So.. K. Uhm." He shrugged a bit. "I'd like t'get up to Dundalk an' see Mary an' Willow home."

K: "Is it long?" I up-nodded to him.

Broken: "Two hours or so by train." He shrugged.

K: "Alright. I'm going, too." I nodded. "AJ. Steela. Sunset. Dusty." I gestured to them.

Steela: "Where you goes, I goes." She nodded.

Applejack: "Durn straight." She grinned.

K: "Alright. Make sure we're fully loaded. Get Cody, Dusk, Trixie, and Rarity, too." I shrugged. "If her mom's bad off, I want her to get a doctor I trust - and pardon me for not trusting Trixie by herself."

Applejack: "Comin' up, honeybun." She trotted off.

Even through her uniform pants, I stared at her ass.

Gorge: "..a very happy marriage, I see." He nodded, with a small smile.

K: "You have no idea." I beamed a grin.

Gorge: "Mm. I'm familiar. I have four foals." He nodded slowly. "I think you can understand my motivation."

K: "You want them to grow up in a land they can be proud of, in their own culture." I shrugged very slightly. "I get it. More than you might think."

Gorge: "That.. Ireland and England thing." He nodded, gesturing.

K: "I had my opinions on it. I won't let them color my actions, here." I nodded slowly.

Broken returned with Mary and Willow. Steela passed out our combat gear. As usual, we would not depart relative safety without armament. While Gorge and Silas and the others might be on our side, now, that wasn't a guarantee that Tirek didn't have surprises waiting for us.

I've been ambushed too many times to let my guard down, now.


TIME: 12:22 GMT
LOCATION: Train to Dundalk, Ironland


I sat in the train car.. eehh.. especially tightly. The seats on this train were notably smaller than Equestrian ones. The seats were barely long enough for two ponies to fit side-by-side. My human ass couldn't fit a second entity next to me, unless they were absolutely tiny.

I was across from Broken and Mary, though. AJ and Willow had the seat behind them.

K: "When we get back to Dundalk, I'll see that you're given protection, Mary." I nodded to her. "Whomever I get, I'll make sure it's the best. The Captain might've been alone in his thievery, but revenge is always a chance. Someone - cousin, his buyer, who knows."

Mary: "Ah'm more werried aboot mah sister." She sighed.

K: "I understand." I nodded slowly, with a smile. "I have foals, too."

Broken smiled at me. He'd met my family - he saw what my domestic life was like, and what it was I was fighting for, more directly than metaphysically.

Broken: "Y'know, Mary, ah.." He cleared his throat. "If'n ye need, me mum's in Dublin.."

She blushed.

K: "Mhm." I got up, I'd let them talk, this was my cue to leave.

So, I went to the next car back, the dining car. It was empty, so I sat down in the rearmost table. Realizing that "empty" also meant no waitstaff, I went over to a small mechanical vending machine. Pulling out my coin purse, I put 1 Ambleonian Shilling into the slot, and retrieved a "ham and egg sandwich."

Of note, this Ambleon is pre-decimal. 12 Pence to a Shilling, 12 Shillings to a Pound. Or, 240 Pence to a Pound. The exchange rate with Equestrian Bits was 1 Bit to 1 Shilling exactly. This was a diplomatic measure instituted long before my arrival. Keeping in mind, of course, that Equestria technically hasn't a sub-currency under the Bit, but they do have Half-Bit, Quarter-Bit, 10th-Bit and 20th-bit coins that would be equal to 50-cent pieces, quarters, dimes, and nickels. They don't have pennies (1/100th bit). Simply put, nothing could be fractally divided that far down in value. So, one must exchange whole Bits to whole Shillings, here.

Not an issue when you walk around with the Royal Credit Cards, more or less.

I heard something in the rearmost car as I was about to sit down. Curiosity aflame, I set the sandwich down on the table, and made my way to the rearmost car.

I heard the sounds of making out. Oooo... Dusk and Rarity? Had to be. I mean, they have such a passionate marriage, and a-

Rarity: "Ah, there you are, darling!" She trotted up behind me.

But, then.. who.. was..?

I was stunned like a goat for a moment. Rarity must've seen this..

Rarity: "Are you alright, K, darling?" She tilted her head at me.

K: "Ahh... we will see." I nodded to the closet in front of us.

I blinked, and opened the door that I'd heard the smooching sounds coming from.

There before us was Dusk, with Trixie pushing him into the back wall of the Closet, her lips all over his, her lipstick marking his face, even gently on his scar.. he was also stiff as a redwood, and she was giving him a sloppy casual hoofjob through his pants.

I could hear Rarity's teeth crack from behind me.

I looked into Dusk's eyes, and saw only terror.

Rarity: "..Trixie, Darling.." She paced over to her at a casual trot. "..while I am.." She grit her teeth. "..EVER SO GLAD.." and relaxed. "..to have you back among us.. as-as a friend..." She cleared her throat. "..and I -am- the Element of Generosity.." She continued, putting her right hoof underneath Dusk's chin. "..and I am so.. magnanimous.." She tilted her head at Trixie, after analyzing EVERY LIPSTICK MARK on his face. "..but, Trixie, Darling.." She cleared her throat. "..I WILL NOT BE GIVING AWAY MY PRECIOUS, HARD-WON, HUSBAND!" She bellowed at absolute full volume.

Trixie: "Ah." She blinked rapidly, several times, wiping the drool from her lips. "Share?"

K: "Sh-sharing is caring!" I was trying SO HARD not to laugh, as Applejack came in behind me, hearing the commotion.

Applejack: "HONEYBUN!" She hissed.

K: "What!? YOU share me!" I leaned in on her, in kissing range.

Applejack: "Mmm.." She leaned up, ALMOST to kiss contact. "..'cuz one'a'm'a'gonna be my lady if'n y'all have to go back. An' I pity Sunset.. an' Steela deserve herself a good stallion t'enjoy fer now." She then pecked me on the cheek.

Rarity: "..huh." She blinked. "You know, dear Applejack, you make a fine point." She nodded. "Trixie? Terms." She trotted up to her, and almost pinned her to the wall. "I cannot deny a great desire to clash verbal swords with you at every opportunity. Your ego is as big as your flank-"

Trixie: "HEY!" She hissed, but was silenced by Rarity putting a hoof over her mouth.

Rarity: "Hush." She said softly. "What I am saying, is, I fear there is only one Mare in all Equestria that could match me.. in.. certain ladylike ways.." She smirked a bit, and turned to Dusk. "..not to mention, be deserving of a stallion like him. And I mean more than just that word."

K: "You're serious!" I smirked.

Rarity: "Oh, indeed." She turned back to Trixie. "Ego. Sass. And I'm going to teach you CLASS, darling. Class to go with the sass. You have the confidence, and I cannot deny your skill in magic. It's only right. We'd be far stronger as a team."

Dusk: "Am I being divided up like war spoils!?" He cocked a brow, eyes wide.

Trixie & Rarity: "YES! HUSH! MARES ARE TALKING!"

Dusk: "Ah-ahh.." *Gulp* He was blushing HARD.

Rarity: "Trixie, I'll be plain. I see potential in you." She ran a hoof under Trixie's jaw. "And I'll not have my twilight years be either lonely, or surrounded by second-best." She nodded, eyes half shut.

Trixie: "Ohhhh...!" She suddenly got a spark of ego. "..so, you're saying.. only The Great and Powerful Trixie-"

Rarity: "-is worthy of sharing -MY- budior... -DARLING.-" She gave the most wicked (Dominant) grin.

K: "..yeah, come on, honey, we better leave. Good luck, Dusk." I nodded to him, and about dragged AJ out by the tail.

Dusk: "Abandoning your officer?!" He asked, with a slight note of fear.

K: "Yep! This is a battlefield for which I have no answer! You're on your own, buddy! Good luck!" I chuckled, and got back into the dining car.. this time taking the table furthest from the rearmost car, so the train's natural noise would drown out the raw, raunchy sex that was about to happen back there.

As I sat down with my food.. Applejack slid under the table and helped herself to a "banana."

I have such wonderful friends.. and a most awesome wife.

Part 5: Dundalk

TIME: 12:22 GMT
DATE: War Day 994/25 Lunaris, 1004 C.S.
LOCATION: Dundalk, Ironland


Getting off the train, Mary and Willow were both excited. This was their first time home in several years. They were wanting to see their mother, but first, they wanted to get her some things. Mary had sent home what money she could while she was working, but Havastaff cut her pay sharply once the thefts began.

Moreover, her mother was so poorly that she couldn't write letters back, though Mary sent one twice a week. Her mother was staying with someone else in Dundalk, who was supposed to be caring for her. Captain Havastaff admitted that for the last few months, any mail addressed to Mary or Willow was simply binned (thrown out).

Broken.. as soon as we were off the train.. was escorting Mary closely. Willow was very chipper, and the three of them were talking.

AJ nudged me, and nodded to them - I could see a faint blush on Broken's snootle. He was.. very happy. There was something here. The mare he "rescued" from a tragic fate, and the two of them were sparking a connection.

Our first stop was a cheesery. Some nice cheeses for sale, and we bought a few wheels of harder cheese, better for long term storage. The bakery was next, and some nice bread was obtained. The general store saw several nice blocks of tea purchased, and some miscellaneous things.

Finally, we stopped at a cake shop and got her a nice chocolate cake, to celebrate Mary and Willow's homecoming.

The house she was at, was towards the edge of town. The stroll was nice, and I drown out most of the conversations by enjoying the scenery. Trixie was boasting about how she was going to be Second Wife to the Stallion that knocked up Luna. AJ and Dusty were discussing plans for the farm. Steela and Sunset were trading stories.

Willow: "Mister K!" She slid up next to me.

K: "Just K, dear. What's up?" I smiled to her.

Willow: "Ah'd be wi' me sis, but she kinda busy." She nodded to Mary and Broken, who were barely following the path, too busy staring into each others' eyes.

K: "I see that." I nodded. "Some day, that'll be you, too, with your special somepony." I smiled.

Willow: "Ye think!?" She giggled. "Me sis an' Mister Broken?!"

K: "I think indeed, Willow. I think. Indeed." I beamed a grin.

Everyone in CAG was like an extended family, now. We had been drawn together from the most horrific of sources - war - but, we had absolutely refused to let it disrupt our natural love for each other. We were still us. We still took time to just BE us. Every fight was a risk, but we would not allow that danger or fear to ruin us or our feelings.

I had a notion that, because of this emotional closeness and support, the number of actual PTSD cases after the war would be minimal. Dr. Turner could probably train enough social workers to handle it, easily.

The house was humble, as we paced up to it. Stone construction, thatched roof. I should've brought Rapid Bearing, Wallflower, and Olivine. It looked like it could use a bit of work.

Mary: "Ah! Here we is. MISTER DOUGHENNEY! MISTER DOUGHENNEY, I'S MARY SPECTRA!" She paced up and knocked.

No answer.

K: "Strange." I cocked a brow.. my hand rested on my Dager. I gave nods, and everyone spread out, and started looking.

Broken was the one that just opened the door.. and looked in.

Empty. Very much empty.

There were, of course, the usual things - tables, cupboards, and things. But it looked like anything useful had been removed. I paced in with Broken, and motioned for Mary to stay outside.

K: "It's abandoned." I stated. "Look, there's.." I picked up a broken saucer from the floor. "..part of a tea set here."

Broken: "Wha' happened?" He asked me, genuinely confused, as he reholstered his L2.

Applejack came back about then, and came in the house with us. She didn't look happy.

Applejack: "Honeybun.. there's.. three kinda fresh graves dug out back." She cleared her throat. "One'a'm'sa Mister Flour Doughenny, a Missus Wheatley Doughnenny.." She looked at Broken. "An' a Hazel Spectra."

Broken: "..by Celestia.." He slunk into the chair.. then nodded to himself. "Ey'll tell'em meself." He said in a low, but determined, voice, then stood, and paced out.

K: "Any idea how..?" I lead on.

Applejack: "W'hull.. Mary'n'Willow's mom died two years ago. Mister Doughenny, four. An' the Missus, last year." She sighed.

K: "Someone buried them." I nodded. "Well, that was nice of them, anyway."

I heard Mary and Willow start crying.

This would've happened anyway, war or not. This wasn't in any way my fault.

I still felt guilty as a shamed whore in a church.


TIME: 15:47 GMT
LOCATION: Broken Dawn's house, Dublin

Declining "Declan" Dawn, Broken's father, was busy trying to cheer up Willow with some of the dolls he made. Yes, his father was no scholar, but a doll and toy maker.

Feathering Wind (Mrs. Dawn) was busy making us tea.

Broken: "..an' I'm kinda.. kinda'thinkin.." He was blushing.

We'd told his mom about our adventures. She was a VERY warm, and motherly, personality. She'd clearly highly influenced Broken's raising to be caring and sensitive - though his father was also a very genuine and loving person, too.

He then told her that, until this, he was kind of thinking romantic thoughts about Mary, but now, was not certain.

Feathering: "Honey.." She put her hooves atop his. "..ye've come s'far.. go t'her. Share her sorrows. Comfert her werries. She needs that, now. She gots no one but us." She smiled.

Broken: "Aye." He nodded, and smiled. "Thanks, mam."

I smiled, nodding as well.

K: "He's a good officer, you know." I cocked a brow to her, knowing she'd get it.

Feathering: "Very good. Very smart. A damned sight smarter than most officers aroun' these parts." She was dismissively cold with that, very unlike her, but I got it - she didn't like the "semi-exclusive club" format of officers in Ambleon.

K: "One of my best friends, too, now." I smiled.

Feathering: "Aye. Yer a fine human, K." She smiled warmly to us, as she served the tea.

I could hear Willow starting to giggle a little as Declan carried on with his silliness.. and Mary wasn't crying any more.

I was sharing an important moment with a friend, again. I knew, this war, would give me many more.

I hoped they were mostly positive ones, though I knew the negative would be close at hand.
