You are Anon. But, you know that already, so let's skip the introductions. Upon arriving in Equestria, Celestia (in her infinite wisdom) decided you were best suited as a diplomat - you could talk a good talk, you were easy to get along with, and despite being alien, you have a knack for getting people (ponies) to understand you.

That and sending YOU out into foreign lands was rather guiltless - you were an outsider, and given your stature, less likely to be intimidated by foreign sentient species. That and, if they killed you, no big loss, right? So, diplomat you are.

Your current docket has you traveling to Zebornica - land of the Zebras (and one of five nations that Zebras belong to). It's an incredibly diverse place, and you soon discovered that the habit of speaking in rhyme is more of a formal thing between Zebras that they do in their own language. The other diplomants and businesszebreas talk straight to you. No rhyme, plenty of reason, and they don't seem to care that you're human, so long as there's business to be had, or negotiations to be made.

Your list of negotiations includes opening direct trade between the governments under a bilateral trade agreement with fixed tariffs, and then negotiating on behalf of several large companies in Equestria to their counterparts in Zebornica for favourable trade terms and marketing opportunities.

Why Celestia didn't just ask Zecora to do this, you'll never understand.

But, that's not what this story is about. No, this story is about the day you first met Star Dahlia.

Star Dahlia was a faded sandy-coated mare with a periwinkle mane. Well, not when you first met her - no, your first meeting was under rather poor circumstances. You see, you were walking alone through the park in Zembwe, the capital of Zebornica, a little drunk (off your ass) from a 'late business meeting' with some Zebornican officials, when you spotted a Working Mare.

No, you just had to take notice - she was the only Pony there, and she was being harrassed by three Working Zebra Mares.. you were a bit too drunk to notice that she wasn't all that clean (or that she was a bit on the "too thin" side).

"H-Hey, just leave me alone!" The Pony Mare protested, being pushed by the larger Zebra mare.

"Your presence is unwelcome, your kind not wanted, so return to whatever halls you once haunted!" The larger Zebra mare snarled, and reared back her hoof as if she was about to pound in her face.

"H-Hey! L-Ladies.." You were a bit too hazy for that to come off as anything but completely unsexy.

Suddenly - seeing the well-dressed traveller - the Zebra mares stopped, and preened themselves a bit.

"A strange creature though he may be, that sack of gold in his pocket is plan to see.." Said the first one, under her breath, pushing the Pony mare aside.

"Truth you speak, sister dear.. let us hope he looks over here.." She presented her rump and whinnied gently.

"I dread the thought of touching that thing, but what lovely income it would bring.." The third trilled at you, and flicked her tail. "Like what you see, foreign prince? Come here, we'll talk price, no words will we mince."

You snort, drunkenly, and wave them away. "I don't want whatever yer sellin' - ya got no business roughing her up."

They look at you with mild surprise - they were preened and prettied to the nines, any stallion with even one ball left would want a piece of 'dat ass.

Not you.

"Go 'way." You make 'shoo' motions. "Yer killin' muh buzz."

*SNORT* "Insult our merchandise we will not tolerate-" The larger one began, reaching into her saddle bag and starting to pull out something metallic.

"SHADDAP with the DUMB RHYMES!" You bellow, cutting her off, your drunken anger working itself up. "GIT! B'fore I call th' guards 'n tell'em yer tryin' ta rob me." One last swig of the bottle you had with you - a decent wine, but very alcoholic. You then smash the bottle on the park bench, and wave it in their faces. "Or I'll jes' buck up them ugly mugs you call faces 'n buck the guards." You narrow your eyes at her - on all fours, she was about 4'6" tall. You basically tower over her.

"A quick relocation may improve our situation!" One of the smaller ones tugged at the larger one's foreleg. "Come! Lest the constabulary have a coronary!"

They departed, tout-de-suite, and you sat on the bench, letting out a large belch.

Fuck, you were starting to sober up (though not by much - just in that 'bad way' where you lose your happy feeling).

"Buzzkills." You toss the broken bottle into the nearest trash can - three feet away, and you miss by a mile.

"Th-thank you, sir.." The Pony Mare approached you, and bowed her head.

"Yeah, no biggie." You give her a drunken grin.

Her cheeks flushed for a minute - you were too drunk to really care about the passage of time - before she found the courage to speak.

"I-I'm.. available.. for.." She blinked a little. "..the night." And shrugged. Talk about a novice!

"Ohh?" You didn't connect the words - there was too much alcohol still in play.

"Y-Yes.. uh.. t-twenty Zenny." She was a bit unsure of herself. "For.. anything you want."

"Oh." You blink - your brain was not processing 'This is a Prostitute' at all. "How about we go get dinner?" You lean forwards a bit. "All I've had are some bready puff balls and wine. GOOD wine, though, lemmy tell ya." You shrug. "Twenty? Bah! I'm a Diplomat from Equestria, I can get a better dinner than that. Let's go!" You hold out your hand.

Yes, your brain took her words and spit out: "This mare is saying that she doesn't mind going somewhere cheap, and 20Z's is about what dinner would cost."

You replied to your brain: "We're going to that nice sit-down restaurant up the way, and it'll be worth every dime."

So, timidly, she does put her hoof in your hand. You smile warmly, and escort her.

"A-A diplomat.." She starts. "..never met one before." She shrugged. "You.. ah.. don't look Equestrian, sir."

"Oh.. that's because I'm not. I'm a human." You nod, with a grin. "But, Princess Celestia found out I'm real good at working deals, and talking to people, so, she offered me a job. Honest? I'm pretty sure she didn't want me around her ponies and was being racist as fuck about this, but saw a chance to make Equestria look progressive, while giving me something to do."

"Oh, I.. I see." She was thinking something a bit different.

You get to the restaurant, and the front end manager looks right at her and narrows his eyes.

"Ah, greetings, Effendi." You bow a bit, and as your hand comes back across, you rather slyly drop a 10Z coin in his front pocket. "We would like a table."

"..I see you know a quick way to make friends. Come, we will put your hunger to an end." He shrugged, and escorted you to the nearest table.

She slid in across from you, when you pulled out a chair for her. Still drunk, you did have an issue getting into your own chair, but once firmly planted, you were fine.

"Start us with some coffee, please?" You nod to him.

"Of course, good sir. And water for you and her. Your server will soon be here, so be ready to make your orders loud and clear!" He smiled and toddled off.

You stare drunkenly at the menu.

"Order whatever you like." You nod to her. "I got it covered."

"O-oh.. I.. I couldn't!" She protested.

"Listen." You lean over. "I'm not too drunk to see you've skipped a few meals. Order whatever you want, or I'm going to be a very sad drunk, thinking you're not getting fed right."

"Y-Yes, sir.." She blushed, and examined the menu.

A rather tall (5' even) Zebra mare marched up, and served the drinks to the two of you - she's dressed well, in a rather foreign blouse and skirt combo that hinted this was the kind of place that catered to foreign nationals.

"Greetings, sir and ma'am. For tonight, your server, I am. Have you had enough time to give your menus a read? If not, please tell me if more time is what you need." She nodded.

You drank some of the water, and looked again at the menu. Then, to the Pony Mare.

"Ladies first." You nod to her.

"Oh, um.. the.. uh.. Chicken Curry, I suppose? I've had that before, it's pretty good." Rather, she's likely had the street vendor version of it. "And couscous."

"Roast chicken and dumplings." You nod. "You don't have tacos here, so, that'll do."

"Your orders are received, I hope, with the food, you'll be most pleased." She nods, and heads off.

"Th-thank you.." The Pony starts. "..no one's treated me to dinner like this before."

"I don't see why." You shrug, the bubbles in your brain going back to a happy state. "You're a nice person."

"Oh.. thank you." She was very humble. She sipped her coffee, and just kinda smiled, looking at the ground.

"Got a name?" You ask, finally, realizing you have no idea what that might be.

"Oh.. ah. Star. Star Dahlia." She shrugged.

"I'm Anon." You nod, drinking more of the water than the coffee - you didn't want to sober up just yet.

The food arrived, and like a starving pit bull faced with a stray toddler, you rather uncouthly tear into it. The roast chicken is great, if just a bit spicy, but the dumplings.. ehhh.. you've had better. They were done local style, not the good ol' American style you were used to.

She ate with more grace. This didn't click in your head that she had a decent raising, but fell on hard times. She did eat eagerly. She smiled as she ate, too, like she was remembering something.

"So.. what do you do?" You shrug, not realizing you'd picked up a literal hooker.

"I make people happy. For a price." She smiled a bit, her lids half closing.

"Oh, an entertainer." You nodded.

"Sort of." She shrugged, and then grinned with a blush, herself just realizing you didn't get it.

"Meet a lot of people that way, eh?" You ask, slurping the skin from the chicken wing and chewing the nubs.

"Yes, yes, I do." She nodded with a small grin.

"Mm. I need an assistant that works good with people." You, however, were thinking about your job and.. non-lewd things.

"Oh." She blinked.

"Want the job?" You raise your head. "I'll have to write back to Celestia to get you a regular paycheck, but, I'll get you anything you want or need in the meantime."

"W-What?!" She blushed, deeply. "You.. you barely know me!"

"You're a nice person.. uhm.. pony." You still weren't using the proper phrasing. "I need someone like that. Someone that can help me organize what I'm doing, greet the jerks I deal with, and put them at ease. I know some of them are a little off put by the fact that I'm human." You fork a dumpling into your mouth, and nom it - it wasn't bad at all.

"I.." She looked down. "..you can't mean that."

"I do." You nod. "I mean.." You look at the main window. "..I get you're probably sleeping in that park, and that's not right. I mean, it's not that hard, and I think you'll do good at it."

"You're.. so nice, Mr. Anon." She smiled. "I guess it's better than what I'm doing right now." She shrugged.

"Awesome!" You beam a grin. "Uh. I apologize. I should've had something more set up."

"Oh! Oh, it's better than I could have hoped for!" She beamed. "Thank you so much.." She lowered her head. "..I'll do whatever I can, to make you happy with this choice."

You smiled a bit, and the two finished your meal. You had a Banana's Foster and you could tell they didn't cook off the rum properly. More booze! Yay!

Not so yay tomorrow, but yay for now!

She did share it with you (it was enough for five people), and when you were done, you picked up the check.

"Here you go, me good man.. er.. good stallion!" You said, tipping the front-end manager 25 Zenny. "And you, dear lady, were a fine server." She got 30, becasue row-row fight da powah, workers of the world unite and go have a picnic.

Or.. something.

"Your patronage is most appreciated, dear one. Should you hunger more, please return and see what we have in store." She replied to the tip.

Star had to help you get out of the restaurant and down the street. She was a bit warmed up as well, but the Foster was just SOO GOOD you couldn't resist eating the whole thing.

"That's.. that's the place there." You point to the nicer-but-not-nicest hotel along the street. "Mmm.. ground floor.. fith.. fiffffth door down right the hall."

Oh-oh.. words are becoming difficult.

The hotel manager scoffed when he saw Star as the one escorting you.

"The company of a paid mare, beside a diplomat from a land fair.." He snorted.

"Damn straight I'mm'a pay her. This'sss's my new social secretary." You point at her.

"Be sure to wash behind your ears, for whatever contaminant she bears." He snorted, and looked down his nose at her.

"Whaa..?" You blink, and scowl. "Is that some sort'a crack!?" You point at him.

"Forget it, Anon, let's just go." She looked up at you with a smile.

"Yeah, yeah.." You snort right back at him, and stick out your tongue.

"Thank you.. Anon." She gave you a slight nuzzle, and got you into the room, fishing your keys from your pocket. "I hope you remember all this tomorrow."

"I have never forgotten a drunken night." You nod to her. "And I've been drunker-er than this before."

"Good. Let.. let's get you to bed." She said, moving you over to the large bed in the room, and getting you to sit, then lay down on it.

You still didn't realize you'd basically hired a hooker. And moreover, she had a completely different idea of what you wanted her to do in terms of "long term employment." The severity of the miscommunication wouldn't really become apparent, though. Not yet, at least.

She.. does strip you. Expertly. Even with your alien form. Down to your boxers. She slips off the over-robe thing she was wearing, revealing she had no cutie mark.

"Oh.. that's.." You are confusion.

"..I never got one." She shrugged. "Now, let me thank you properly for this wonderful evening." She smiled, though.

She.. valiantly attempted to make your monkey bits stand at attention, but they were not complying with her usual gentle touch, having fished them out of your boxers, and gently kissing and caressing them with her snout.

"Ooo.. that.. that feels good." You lay flat, staring at the ceiling, blinking. "Uhm.. just.. I don't do so well drunk." You say, looking down at her, right into her eyes..

..those eyes.. you just realize how pretty they are, looking at you with (well practised) affection. THAT gets you going. The idea of some kind of connection between you.

If you were sober, you might not have gone through with this. To be fair, she's a bit buzzed as well. But, when you got hard, she just.. took the lead and started licking YOUR banana. Gentle strokes from a silken tongue that knew well its job. You were moaning like a cat in heat in short order.

This seemed to (genuinely) entertain her. She giggled a bit.

"You're so vocal." She said, getting up, and sliding over your hips. "I have to admit.. it's.. on the larger side.."

The scale here, being, she's about 4'8" standing on her hind legs. You're about 6'1" or so, and Anon, Jr. is above average for human appendages. The typical length she could expect out of a stallion would be.. almost two inches shorter than you, though more filled out and cylindrical.

That didn't stop her from gently sliding your shaft into her inviting (and aroused) marehole. She even let out a moan of her own, and you found yourself almost perfectly bottomed out in her. Almost. There's a bit more of YOU than there is of HER.. which made HER relax ALL of her weight on it.

"OHHHhhhhhhhhh!" She smiled. "I-I've actually.. never.. had one this long before.." She panted a little. "Feels.. feels good.."

"So.. tight.. warm.. mmmmm.." YOU were not really capable of solid thought.

She rode you, growing more shameless and greedy with each rise and fall of her delicate form. She started moaning, too.. it'd been a long time since Star had actually been aroused for someone, more still since she'd felt anything approaching real pleasure from the act.

YOU were giving her both.

You gently rest your palms on her flanks as she rides you, your eyes locking with hers.. you can both feel something here. Something good, something that even through the Alcohol haze, you both kinda wanted, and that want was growing with each passing moment.

The act lasted longer than she thought possible.. she had, legitimately, climaxed five times before you got close. And when you did, you took command, sliding your hands to her hips, and slapping her wet marehood down on you faster and faster, absolutely banging the back of her inviting hole, she cried out, and CLENCHED harder than she had her last few climaxes, and that made you absolutely EXPLODE inside her, and vocalize an indecipherable noise.

You also both passed out almost instantly.

Er.. with you still inside her, and her draped over you, nuzzling your chest.

When the two of you awaken the next morning, however...

"Oh.. gosh.." She looks down at you, with your morning wood JUST sliding out of her, as it wasn't fully hard.. "..oh, my!"

"Oh! Hello!" You smile lazily. "Thank you for everything last night.." You lean up and kiss her cheek. "..it's the first time since I got here, that I felt like someone really cared about me." You shrug a bit. "Still want that job?"

"Uh.. that.. you were serious?" She blinks a few times.

"Sure was." You reach your arm over her, and pull her into a hug. "I mean it, though. Thank you. You didn't have to. I was so drunk."

"A-Ah-aw.." She flinched a bit, but relaxed. "..you kinda paid me for it, you know."

"Just because I bought you dinner and gave you a job? Naw. I did that because you needed dinner, and I need an assistant." You shrug a bit. "It.. it was pretty magical though.."

"..it was.." She echoes, a bit unsure of herself. "..I guess that job beats staying in the park, huh?"

"Sure does. And you don't HAVE to sleep with me - there IS another bed in the room. Don't go thinking you owe me.. that.. just because I'm your boss or something." You smile down at her.

"Mm.." She slides out from your grasp, and heads to the bathroom. "..but, what if I want it?" She asks herself, out of your earshot, as she starts the shower.

You wait for her to finish. Even if you did fuck last night, you didn't feel it was right to suddenly start invading her space like you owned her.

SHE, on the other hand, had it in her head that you kinda did. She was used to being treated poorly, and even if you HAD been nice to her, she simply did not understand that was you being a good person.. not buying her services for a protracted period of time, and more or less being her Pimp. Which gave you.. certain expectations.. to have access to her.. whenever you pleased. At least in her mind.

Neither of you understood the other. Both accepted each other's kindness and affection as presented.

You had breakfast delivered to the room. A decidedly no-alcohol breakfast, to be sure.

"..this is really good." She smiled a bit, at you.

"It better be." You nodded. "So, anyway, I need to get you something proper to wear. Something conservative and not too flashy, so, when you interface with people, they feel more at ease."

Again, she took this entirely differently. To her, this was her Pimp getting her some Costumes.

"Sure." She nodded, taking this in stride. "Anything you'd like to see on me?"

"A smile?" You shrug - that was a compliment, not an expectation. "But, seriously, there's a couple tailors in the city I'm going to take you to."

"You're so good to me." She lowered her head.

"You deserve it." You nod.

"Thanks." She smiled again, blushing just a bit.

And, really, she absolutely did not feel like she deserved anything. Nothing nice, that is. Just existing and having enough Zenny or Bits or whatever to feed herself, that's her feeling LUCKY. Now, here's this human.. alien creature.. that desires her company, and wants to 'employ' her? As far as she's concerned, being owned by an Alien Pimp that's looking out for her, is a step up.

You took her to the best tailor you could find, and had her measured.

"Mm.. she a bit t'in, Effendi." The Camel Tailor said.

"Yeah, make sure you give her a bit of leeway in those clothes. I intend to make sure she eats right, so she gets back to a more healthy weight." You smile to her.

She just blushes at the attention.

"Ahh! Yes, yes, my clothes shall last her twenty years!" He bows to both of you. "Such is the durability of my stitch, Effendi."

"Well, given how fashion goes, we might be back in five." You shrug.

This REALLY makes her blush - the sheer thought that her new Pimp wanted to keep her around THAT long? To her, this was better than she ever hoped, hearing those kind words.

After an hour waiting for one of the outfits to be completed on the spot, you take her next door to a place that sells accessories, and get her some basic things. Proper hoof shoes (what would be called very low, or Kitten Heels on Earth), a couple simple necklaces to compliment the outfits, a nice hairband with a small decorative bow on it made of real silver, and a couple different bracelets, and a nice watch.

After all, if she's going to be your Social Secretary, she needs to be able to tell time.

To her, this is you decorating your property.

Lunch was at a small cafe that served mainly Griffons, but they had salads and very nice Alfalfa hay on the menu. You? Grilled ham sandwich with local cheese.

"I've never felt so pretty, before." She spoke in low tones.

"You deserve it, like I keep saying. You're such a nice per- eh.. pony. You deserve to be treated right." You give her a little smile. "Now, this afternoon, we need to go to a local rich guy's house. He's got commerical import contacts all over the region. Him and his partner, both, will be there, but he's the one with control over the company's finances. I'll work him over. Think you can distract his partner for me? I'd rather divide-and-conquer than try to face them both at the same time."

"I-I can do that." She nods.

Again, she's thinking in terms of Pimp and Pro. To her, you just asked her to seduce and pleasure the partner, while you talk up the main guy. And, given that she sees herself as your property, now, and very happy to be so.. she agreed, and mentally prepared herself for another emotionless physical performance.

YOU, on the other hand, thinking she's an entertainer of an entirely different kind, thought she could distract him with conversation for an hour or so. Maybe slip in a few jokes, or something. After all, you never DID put it together that those three Zebra you met last night, were ALSO hookers, and had been trying to bully her from their space.

Really, to you, you didn't have any concept of how this world approached that sort of thing.

That afternoon, you arrived at the Local Guy's house. His proper name was Boxlock Steamtrunk, and he was a descendant of Ponies, from a time when they had a colony over here about ~150 years ago. His partner was Lextro Lakil, a part-breed Zeehorse.

YOU needed to get Boxlock to agree to certain things. He was pointed out to you over his competitor, Will Longways, as his operation was larger.

His estate was very much what you'd expect a rich English family on Earth would have, in Africa, if they were lording their riches over the locals. It.. kinda offended you, to be honest. Maybe Box was a decent fellow?

Entering the grounds of the Estate, you see several Zebra as staff wandering around doing things, and keeping the place immaculate. They all wore collars of some kind. Not like a uniform, more like a symbol. You cocked a brow.

"He owns them." Star warned you.

"Owns them? Like, slaves?" You look to her.

"Yeah.. yeah, those collars are for slavery. The big boss, here, bought them for servitude. Slavery is legal, here." She shrugged.

"I heard about that.. but.. like.. it's supposed to be limited to debt slavery." You frown.

"Yeah. They usually give the parents or another family member a so-called loan, and after six months, they hand over the victim to pay off the debt." She shrugged. "They're usually here for a very long time, and they do everything they can to keep them, too. Charge them room and board, charge them for breathing, even." She scoffed. "And they maybe pay down 1 Zenny of the debt per day. Maybe."

"That's terrible!" You scowl. "If I didn't need this guy's help." You shake your head.

"Don't worry.. I'll distract his partner.." She nods a bit, seeming a bit down.

You think it's because of the slavery thing. It's not.

At the door, a proper Pony butler meets you, a very curt little stallion from Germaneigh.

"You are zee reprezentative from Ekvestria?" He snaps to attention, slightly narrowing his eyes at you.

"Yes." You nod to him.

"I am herr Otto. Valk zis vay." He snaps on his rear hooves, and almost goose steps down the hall to the outer foyer.

You.. just walk normally, as does Star.

Seated there is Boxlock and Lextro.

Boxlock steps up immediately, and puts his hoof out.

"Boxlock Steamtrunk!" His accent is 'rough posh' - like a Received BBC accent, but rougher, like the Narrator has been to the Pub. "Noice to meet you!" He nods to his partner. "Lextro, ova there's, my partner."

"Plezyah." His accent is unmistakable South African Briton. "Who's this lass?"

"My assitant, Star Dahlia." You gesture to her. "She'd like to keep you company.." You look back to Boxlock. "..while we talk, sir."

Lextro grins widely at her.. and you can't see it, as she's behind you, but Star looks a bit saddened, and shrinks back a bit.

"Oh, we met once b'fore, mate." Lextro says to you, grinning a bit. "I'd be d'lighted to renew our 'quaintence." He smirks.

YOU think she probably entertained at an event he had, once, or something like that. You don't know that he's "been with" her before.

"Roight, then!" Boxlock nods, and leads you to his office. "Let's us talk import and export, eh?"

"Let's!" You put on a cheerful face, and follow him into his personal office.

The office itself is very nice, and what you'd expect to see in a Colonizing Briton's private quarters. There's a few hunt trophies here, too. Now, you're no expert on Pony culture, but you're pretty sure this is a rather.. eh.. "dominant" display of power, social status, and Herd Status as an Alpha Male. Rather, this is the decorative trappings of it.

He pulls out a large decanter of Brandy, and pops the cork, pouring two and offering to you. You accept and toast him.

"To our potential profitable relationship, sir." You grin.

"Aye, lad! Aye!" He toasts back. "Nothin' bettah in this world than some shin'n' gold made fair, hale, and hearty."

"Indeed." You nod back. "So, there are a few larger commerical concerns back in Equestria that would like to import their goods, here. And in exchange, they'd like to see what your company can sell them."

"Diamonds." He nods. "I own th' mine. Plus, Bauxite, Copper, Coal.. on the manufacturing side, I've access to semi-refined ores, and.. locally crafted furniture!" He patted his chair. "Solid as granite, an' they make it fer peanuts." He shrugged a bit, and paced around the side of the desk. "Throw on a 25% profit, an' ye can still get a fine chair like that fer 120 Zenny. Thing'll last a hundred years, an' Termites won't go near it!" He chuckled a bit.

"Termite-resistant furniture.." You nod. "..it would certainly have a market in a few major areas."

"Indeed, lad, indeed." He smirked. "An' we can werk in a little bonus for yerself, too."

"Oh?" You pretend to be surprised.

"If you can convince yer merchants they're getting a squarer deal than I'm really offerin' - well.. be extra profit lain around, is all I'm saying." He smirked, wolfishly.

"Oh, I dig, I dig." You nod.

Not that you - being relatively honest - wouldn't report this extra income and use it to further Equestria's diplomatic exploits. Despite what Celestia might think of you.

"So's.. what kinda markets've Equestria got to offer?" He nods a bit to you.

"Well, Manehattan is a pretty up-scale town, lots of richer folks.. and Canterlot is about the same, smaller population of them-"

*Anguished cry*

"Star?!" You bolt out of your chair, and dash into the other room, With Box right behind you.

What you see is Lextro on top of her, with his horsecock ramming into her asshole, his mouth clamped on her neck, and his forehooves holding her shoulders down, creating pressure, and a pull on the flesh in his teeth. Her skirt is torn, her blouse is ripped..

..and you're seeing RED!

You grab the nearest thing you can find - a hefty fireplace poker, a rather common weapon-of-choice in self defense situations, really - and leap on Lextro, clubbing him over the head several times, knocking him off (and out) of her.

Thing is, when he rolls off, you strike him several MORE times.

"YOU RAPIST PIECE OF SHIT! I'M GONNA CAVE IN YOUR HORSEY SKULL!" You scream at his face.

Boxlock has other plans. HE goes for his sabre, mounted over the mantle, and dives in towards you.

"ANON! LOOK OUT!" Star yells, just in time.

He's shorter than you, and has a lower center of gravity. You just step WAY BACK, and let him graze you a bit. You then send the tip of that poker HARD into his flank, making him stumble. You jump on him, shoving the mouthguard of the sabre into his maw, keeping him from getting a good mouth grip on it, and choking him a bit, before using the pommel of the fireplace poker to club him in the forehead and face several times, before grabbing the sabre out of his mouth.

You then step back with both weapons.

"Fuck both of you. Wait until I tell Celestia about this!" You spit at Boxlock.

"YOU BLOODY FOOL!" He sneers. "What do you THINK is going to HAPPEN to you NOW!? WE OWN this country! And whoever we DON'T own, LISTENS WELL to-"

You stab him in the neck, hard, with his own sabre, jamming it up to the hilt.

"BLOODY FOOKI'HELL!" Lextro watches this very Human murder, with blood pouring from Boxlock's neck wound, and scampers back on his hooves, belly up, pissing himself.

"You're next." You pull the sabre from Boxlock's neck, and charge after him.

"NO! NO! I SWEAR TO THE SUN, I DIDN'T KNOW! FOOK! PLEASE!" He scampers all over the furniture like the frightened animal that he is.

You DIVE over it, CONSUMED with rage (and a bit of liquor to back it up), and TACKLE him to the ground, BEATING his face with the mouthguard of the sabre, until he grows still.

He's still breathing.

"Fuck it. The dead can't learn anything." You rise up, and slide a hand down his torso.. and grasp his orb sack. "A gelded stallion, can."

"Uhghm.. UH!? WHAT?! NONONONONO-YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRgsgdsfdplllff....fff..."

He passed out from the excrucating pain of having both of his testicles amputated with a bladed implement JUST BARELY sharp enough to do the job.

You stand over him with his bloody balls in your hands, and throw them at his unconscious face.

"A-A-ahh... Anon!" Star finally finds her voice.

"Star.. are you okay?" You say, slightly turning your head to her, not realizing the tears are streaming from your face.

"Y.. I'll.. I'll be okay.. Anon! You-You're crying!" She looked shocked.

"Back in the human world.. someone.. someone did something like that to my sister.." You wipe your face. "..she jumped off a building, later." You say, pacing over to her, and slinking down to your knees, and hugging her. "I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Star.. no one should have to go through that."

"Anon.. you..?" She was confused. "I thought.. you wanted me.. to.. uhm.." She swallowed hard. "I thought you wanted me to have sex with him, though?!"

"NO!" You pull back, and gently hold her shoulders. "Why would you ever think that!?"

"..aren't I your property?! Aren't.. you like.. my pimp!?" She asked, worried and confued.

"No! NO, Star, NO!" You hug her. "Oh, Star.. I.. I'm so sorry. I.. no, no, no.. no. I mean it - you're my secretary."

"But.. I'm.. I'm a prostitute, Anon! I'm just a dumb Blank Flank whore that can't.. can't do anything.. anything right.." She sobbed. "..I can't even be a good Pro!"

"No, Star.. I don't see that. I don't see any of that. I see a lady that needs a chance, and I know you can do it." You pet her mane. "I don't own you. We're friends. I.. at least I'd like to think we are. And I'm actually employing you to keep me on the straight and narrow, help me keep a schedule, remind me of what I'm supposed to do, how to dress, things like that. A secretary. Not a Hooker." You cling to her. "You're not a Prostitute any more."

"Oh, Anon!" She sobbed back into your shoulder.

Otto? He saw what happened.. as did several of the slaves. Around you, a Slave Revolt was in progress, but that didn't matter to you. Otto was being dragged out of the house to be hanged, but you didn't care.

All that mattered to you was that your friend.. and somepony you had a mild romantic interest in.. was in pain. You let her cry, as the smell of burning horse flesh reached your nose. You glanced up to see Otto being burned alive instead.

You somehow didn't care. Given how they were brutalizing him, he must've earned it.

For the time being, you got up, and helped her get up, then went to leave. One of the Slaves stopped you at the door.

"Our freedom we now regain, and you, brave strange one, were the ones to give our captors pain. Go from here unmolested and unharmed, and know that gratitude, you have farmed. One day will come we shall repay this debt, fear not, no matter what adversity you might've met." The slave named Zororast nodded to you, and escorted you to the gates.

The slaves started looting the place. Really, if anyone investigated this, it would look like the slaves started all of this, and you just happened to get away, with your companion being slightly accosted in the process.

Boxlock and Lextro would go down as cruel Slave Holders that were finally bested by the Zebras they claimed to own. You'd go down as a lucky bystander.

Still, now, you have a companion, and many challenges ahead of you. What will fate call you to, next? Will it be boring negotiation or exciting adventure?

But, that's a tale for another time.

~(Possibly NOT) The End?
