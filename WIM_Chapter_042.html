Part 1: Northern Vacation

TIME: 02:01 Canidan Western Time (CWT)
DATE: War Day 425/4 Sextus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Havoc's Compound, Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Republic of Canida


K: "Estrus?!" I looked at her in surprise, sitting up naked in the bed.

Applejack: "Ah'm sure of it, Honeybun.." She was flushed. And.. stuffed. WELL stuffed. "..ah k'n feel it." She shrugged.

K: "Well.. what do we do? Last time.." I pondered. "..it was just before the war, actually.. you're overdue.." I looked at her. "Do you have irregular estrus?"

Applejack: *BLUSH* "I-I don't likes talkin' 'bout it.." She buried her face in her hooves. "..it's really 'm'bar'a'sin' even 'mongst other marefolk.." She cuddled up to me, though.

K: "H-How often.. then.." I gestured.

Applejack: "Might be 'nother year 'n some. Might be two." She felt ashamed.

K: "So.. we either go now, and you'e out of action for about 200 days, or.." I shook my head. "..we wait for whenever the next one is, and hope the war's over and everyone is alive, and you haven't been... damaged.." After what'd happened - TWICE - to Fluttershy, I feared it was only a matter of time before...

Applejack: "I-I don't know what'ta do!" She started crying, and hugged me.

Of course, I held her close to me.

K: "I don't, either. As a father, I want a.. I want this possibility. This chance. As a General.." I looked at the window.

Applejack: "Buckin' TIREK!" She punched a pillow. *Sniffle* "Waitin' a couple years.. ah dunno.. lot c'n happen..." She looked away. "..both sides'a th' coin." She looked up at me. "Ah dun wanna.. y'know.. have our foal.. an'.. you die 'cuz I can't be there as the Element.." She hugged me again.

K: "Yeah. Uhm." I shrugged. "How long will your fertility last?"

Applejack: "'Bout another day or two.." She shrugged. "Tonight or tomorrow night, 's'gotta be done.." She held my arm close. "Yew felt greedy b'fore? Now I'm's tha one feelin' greedy.." She nuzzled me. "Ah wants a foal, K. Ah wants one with you.." And squeezed - and despite her torture, she was still strong. "..and damns the consequences. But then I gets ta thinkin' about-"

K: "The Neighpon Campaign has to be completed. Furthermore, we have to finish training and equipping Equestria's allies. We also have to see about constructing our own aircraft and armored vehicles. We pushed Tirek back, for now. We need to focus on preparing for the inevitable invasion of his homeland. That's going to take time." I hugged her. "I will make the time. We can do this, Jackie. And I have legitimate military reasons to take the actions I'm proposing." I nodded.

Applejack: "Y'ain't jes sayin' that?" Serious voice again, not weepy.

K: "Dead serious." I shrugged, sliding out of bed and getting dressed. "I'll be back."


TIME: 02:30 Canidan Western Time
LOCATION: North Star Lodge, Yellowknife

I went right into Forest Spirit's room, and found him already asleep with Redheart, cuddled to her like a protective parent.

Well, he wasn't really asleep, and neither was she. I heard a pair of Morgans decock under the sheets.

K: "I've made you two, too paranoid!" I grinned.

Forest Spirit: "General?" He kept his eyes closed. "No offense, but this better be important."

Redheart: "Comfy. Warm. Don't wanna move." She shrugged.

K: *Flatly* "Fine, I'll spoon your Mare, you go plant the seed into mine." I stared at them both.

Forest Spirit: "Wut?" NOW his eyes opened.

Redheart: "Are you serious?" She looked up.

K: "Applejack is in Estrus, and she just admitted she has irregular Estrus. She might not have another for as long as two years. One of us could be dead, or maimed, by then." I shrugged. "I've already gone over all the alternatives."

Forest Spirit: "K.." He sat up, and set the Morgan on his bed stand.

K: "I trust you." I sat next to him and put a hand on his shoulder. Then I one-arm hugged him.

Forest Spirit: "..you had faith in me. Because you did, I became a warrior.." He touched his scarred eye with the edge of his hoof. "..I've given an eye in the service of my people. But, I have real friends, now. I didn't have that before. Ask Redheart. I was a loner. I kept to myself in the Parks. I was content, but not truly happy. I have people that respect me. I have friends that cherish me. I have the most beautiful Mare.. mate. All those things I never had before. Now.. I have all that. And now, I'm being asked by my boss-"

K: "Best Friend." I interjected.

Forest Spirit: "Best friend. To father his foal." He hugged me. "No homo."

K: "No homo." I hugged back.

Redheart: "You took away my warm!" She pouted. "Replacement!" She nodded to the bed.

K: "Tag in!" I popped a Bro Hoof.

Forest Spirit: "Tag in. Brother." He popped one back.

I got into bed with Redheart, platonically hugging on her like one might a sister or cousin that one's particularly close to. She still had her Morgan under the sheets with her. And, of coure, I was still fully dressed.

Redheart: "I wouldn't have agreed if you and I weren't best friends, too, K." She leaned back and gave me a back-nuzzle. "Rub the tummy, please?"

I did. It reminded me of J-- when she had tummy issues.

K: "Everything you've ever done, Red. Everything. We've been in direct orbit since before the war." I got comfortable. "You're family, to me."

I dozed off, having traded partners, but in my case I didn't even want to play with Redheart. It felt like I would actually be doing incest, if I did. Besides, she was pregnant. Ew. Some lines, I just won't cross.

Apparently, though, banging sentient horses and cat-women, aren't among them.


TIME: 07:45

I woke up with Forest Spirit on the other side of Redheart, and Applejack almost on top of me. She felt different..

..and both Celestia and Luna were at the end of the bed.

K: "Time to face the music, everyone." I said, and like the trained soldiers they were, they all woke up and stared them down.

Celestia: "Oh, dear." She recoiled back, a bit.

Luna: "I warned you this was a bad idea." She shrugged.

K: "I'm paranoid, remember?" I glanced between them.

Forest Spirit: "It doesn't help the scandals that you've all been involved in - that I'm now a part of." He shrugged.

Celestia: "K, what if I told you, you could have your pie and eat it, too?" She cocked a brow at me.

Applejack: "Eh.. whut'ya mean?" She asked for me.

Celestia: "I.. have.. the power to magically trans-"

K: "I know where this is going. Surely, you can't be serious." I blinked.

Celestia: "K, you and I both know that you're special, Applejack is special.."

Redheart: "My Stallion's special." She hoof-hugged him, but carefully enough that she wouldn't interrupt a draw of his sidearm.

Luna: "He is!" She beamed a grin.

Celestia: "..and I am serious." She shrugged. "And don't call me Shirley, my name is Celestia." She giggled.

K: "You've been talking to Webley Weaver." I cocked a brow. And looked at Applejack. "We'd have to discuss it."

Celestia: "Fifty days. I have to wait that long for the foal to be properly formed. You have from then, until the due date, to decide." She shrugged.

K: "Understand, I've already picked out duties for myself that wouldn't require her participation. Enough to keep me busy until the due date." I shrugged. "So it's not like we.. made a rash decision, here, that would negatively impact the war."

Celestia: "You were right.." She nodded to Luna.

Luna: "When it comes to our lover, I usually am." She grinned.

K: "OUR lover?" I blinked, feigning shock and butthurt.

Forest Spirit: "Matriarchal society, bro." He shrugged. "We're meat." He chuckled.

K: "..point taken." I gave them both a silly-sarcastic grin.

[End of Part 1]


Part 2: Domestic Decision

TIME: 11:07 Canidan Western Time (CWT)
DATE: War Day 425/4 Sextus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Republic of Canida


I was seated at a table with all the girls, my boys (Forest Spirit, Dr. Allcome, Norfy, Gaze, and Cosmic), the princesses, and a few others - Tankette Blinda, Lord Sombra, Air Commodore (promoted!) Iris Emerald, Senior Chief Airfleet Mechanic Frosted Diamond (a Crystal Pony mare of chestnut complexion), Havoc, Redheart (since her Stallion was there), Webley Weaver (now in charge of her own Paratrooper Company), Derpy and Dr. Whooves, and Guard Commander Ironhide.

Quite the council!

And the subject was.. Applejack. She, for once, was taking shelter behind Fluttershy.

K: "..and I really appreciate the concern you all have for the Elements of Harmony, but really.." I looked at all of them. "..Celestia entrusted the war to me." I gestured. "Trust that I've already thought about all the angles." I glanced at Celestia. "All of them."

Celestia looked back at me with a grin, before Sombra piped up.

Sombra: "As for mineself, good sir, I wished only to express congratulations! To have a foal is a joy.." He lowered his head a bit. "..perhaps one I shall experience one day."

Iris, of all people, put a hoof on his armored pauldron. Oh-oh.. was the Commodore interested in her boss? Well, he IS a fine warrior, and he cuts an impressive form as an Alicorn. A raven-colored one, at that.

Dr. Allcome: "Same with me, K. I mean.. we've been good friends for over two years.." He shrugged. "..I'd be honored to administer the pregnancy.." He grinned a little.

Ironhide: "I'm here to support you, too." He shrugged. "After what we've been through.. if you need me and my Mare to watch your foal.." He gestured.

Dr. Whooves: "I.. I'm just here as a friend." He shrugged, and Derpy nuzzled him. "You encouraged *our* relationship. Least I can do, and all.." He glanced at everyone, and had a bit of a blush.

Derpy: "We want another. After the war, though. Dinky is enough for now." She beamed.

Webley: "No respect! No respect at all." She shook her head, deadpanning Rodney Dangerfield. "I.. babies are cute. I'd be honored to help babysit or something." She grinned.

Celestia: "Now, now, everyone. We're making Applejack feel bad enough as it is." She put a protective wing over the expectant mother.

Applejack: "Ain't used't bein' the center of attention lahk this.." She was blushing. Hard.

Blinda: "It's okay, AJ." She shrugged. "We're here to show you our friendship, not call you out."

Frosted: "I'm.. not quite sure why I'm here, other than I was promised lunch at the Commodore's expense.." She looked at Iris, who just gave her a grin back.

Iris: "She's a marefriend. Back when we were.. i-in the past.. she and I used to consult a lot. Sooo... friend-of-a-friend?" She blushed, too.

Twilight: "The more friends, the merrier." She nodded.

K: "No kidding. I think we've all proven the magic of friendship can win the big fights, and then some."

We just needed a few battalions more Friendship if we wanted to beat Tirek with science. Or better equipment. Something.

Fluttershy: "Yes. And it can help heal wounds.. the kind you can't see.." She lowered her head.

Celestia: "Either way, K and Applejack have a major decision to make. Two, actually.." She looked at me.

K: "Applejack and I have decided to have a wedding. In Equestria. In Ponyville." I looked at all of them. "You're all invited. Everyone is."

Pinkie: "It'll be the bigget party EVAR!"

Webley: "Evaaarrrr!" She echoed in a memey-tone.

Toola: "I can't wait to paint the Bride and Groom.." She looked at me.

K: "We'll have to wait for the airships to become operational again. Iris told me they used up all the fuel that came with them, just to get here. Then we'll head to Ponyville. Pinkie, I want you and the girls - minus my bride-to-be - back on the trains. We'd like to have the ceremony when we arrive. Forest Spirit wants to have a Renewal of Vows ceremony twinned with ours and AJ and I have already agreed to it.."

Redheart: *Coff* "Rarity, I'm.. ah.. going to need my wedding dress let out some.. a lot.." She blushed. "..Doc Allcome says it's twins.."

Everyone clapped.. hoof-clapped. Havoc barked happily.

Luna: "I think it would only be right to declare a day of celebration. Two of our highest ranked officers are having a wedding." She nodded. "One of whom is a l-"

Celestia: "-very GOOD friend.."

Luna: *Glare* "Lover."

Celestia coughed uneasily.

Luna: "Of one of the Princesses.. and has a foal with her." She shrugged. "Starlight's adopted, but no matter. She is OURS.." She stated firmly.

K: "Save failed, Celestia." I smirked.

Celestia: "Methinks my sister has grown too bold in her station.." She nudged her with her other wing.

Luna: "Mmm.. you're just jealous that the Monkey Sex God is tending MY bedchambers, dear sister, with REGULARITY.." A very, very wolfish grin.

Almost everyone at the table got VERY uncomfortable at that statement. The only girl that didn't blush hard was Iris. Even Forest Spirit had to nudge himself closer to Redheart. I could tell Cosmic, Norfy, and Gaze were all embarassed. Heavily. Frosted was feeling SO out of place. Sombra.. gave me a bro-ish nod. I knew he'd been.. involved.. with them somehow.

K: "Luna!" I was the one to call for modesty.

Luna: *Self-assured chuckle* "Well, it IS true.." A shrug. "..and I'm proud of it." She looked at Celestia as if to say 'I'm not going to let myself feel bad about myself or my actions any longer.'

Celestia returned a very sisterly gaze of congratulations for getting over her own mental walls.

Radio Active: "Sorry I'm late!" She came in with a tray full of baked delights. "I brought baked goods."

She came in to all the males having to hide their hindquarters (save Havoc, who didn't find the situation distressing), all the girls looking like one of them got outed, Luna with a haughty grin, and Celestia looking pleased. And me, blushing.

Radio: "K? Uhm.. what did I miss?" She set the baked goods down at the table.

Celestia: "There will be a wedding at Ponyville in perhaps a month. We were just going over some details." She hushed down the tone of the conversation, to save some humiliations.

Norfy: "..I'll tell you later, Rad." He gave her a 'help me' look.

Radio: "I get the feeling I just missed something.." She looked at Webley.

Webley: "Ah! No-no, no clopfic going on h- DARNIT!" She covered her mouth.

Radio: "Hee-hee.. all I need to know." She paced over to Norfy, and flicked her tail over his flank.

K: "She's got her resources." I looked at Norfy.

Norfy: "I.. well.." He looked at her, then back to me. "..perhaps later, I can address a more private matter with you, K." He gave me a sympathetic look.

K: "Alright, sure." I shrugged.

Rarity: "Well! I suppose I should get to packing." She looked at me. "Already been shopping, Darling. I have a *lot* to pack." She smirked. "Next train isn't until tomorrow at 8 in the morning." She shrugged.

Havoc: "Yeah.. ah.. Yellowknife is only serviced by one outbound and one inbound train. Outbound leaves at 8:15. Inbound arrives at 15:00 and overnights a bit north of here, at Coalstream Junction." He shrugged.

K: "Well, then. Lunch!" I announced.

No military business for now. Just domestic issues. We had a grand lunch, even if the food shoe was on the other foot - Gaze looked a bit green at all the meat options on there, and I was.. pleased. I shot him a grin, but I reached over and gave him a half-hug.

Gaze: "Ehh.. guess as canids, they gotta eat meat, eh, suh?" He weakly grinned.

Cosmic: "I-I'm.. not about to insult our hosts. I'm sure if we were some place like Saddle Arabia, we'd have a lot of dates and things, and K-"

K: "Would be ordering lamb. Very common in middle eastern dishes.. that, and chicken. They won't eat pork or ham." I shrugged. "At least where I'm from."

Norfy: "Gentlecolts.. really.." He grinned and shook his head. "We've been around K for two years. We know his dietary habits." He shrugged. "I think I'll try this Elk Ground Steak." He rubbed his chin with his right fetlock. "Definitely the Spring Salad, though."

K: "It's almost Summer." I shrugged. "Next month, in fact."

I dawned on me that, I'd been there three years or so, and had not actually paid attention to the calendars. Even when dealing with armaments manufacture and things, time was expressed in generalities - things would be done in 20 days, or 25. And I kept track more or less using my own calendar based on War Days, and before that, my Gregorian calendar days.

I did some math while the food was prepared and served, and came up with...

K: "..I know my birth day." I shrugged.

Cosmic: "So do I, sir.." He wasn't sure where to go with that.

K: "10 Decemus 969." I stated. "You know.." I looked at Celestia. "..I hadn't paid attention to the calendars since I got here. It didn't seem important." I looked at Twilight. "Remember what I said about forgetting?" Odd thing to say. "Remember what happened..? With Chrysalis?" I prodded.

Twilight: "..she killed my brother.." She shook her head. "I can't forget that."

K: "Does it hurt?"

Twilight: "I.." She blinked. "..I feel bad, but.." And shook her head. "How long ago WAS that?"

K: "War Day 312. It's now War Day 425. 113 days, or, by your calendar, nearly four months ago." I shrugged.

Twilight: "..why does it feel longer..?" She looked at Celestia. Then Luna.

Celestia: "I'm going to be honest, My Student. I really don't have an answer. I do not know." She shook her head.

K: "Fluttershy." I pointed. "Grogar."

Fluttershy went to recoil, but stopped, and looked at me.

Fluttershy: "I won't let that memory hurt me." She glared. Glared.

K: "How long ago do you think it was?"

Fluttershy: "I.." She looked down at the ground, then back up. "..don't remember."

K: "War Day 140. Nine and a half months ago. 285 days. Octavius, 1002." I shrugged.

Fluttershy: "..seems longer.. ancient history.." NOW she was muttering.

Norfy: "You're going to quiz me, next, aren't you?"

K: "Do you remember?" I queried.

Norfy: "Yes, I had a psychological break over RD over there. Past lives coming forwards." He nodded. "War Day 61. 5 Sextus 1002. Or, exactly a year ago, sir." He shrugged. "I watch the calendar with attentive-"

Gaze: "Obsession." He smirked. "Jes' takin' a piss, mate." He grinned at him.

K: "Mhm. Anyway, as I said before, I think there's some kind of semi-beneficial curse on the land that MAKES us forget. A spell of carefree, I once called it. It makes us stop thinking about the painful stuff, and focus on the good stuff - and our duties, jobs, and so on. Part of that would be.." I looked around. "..not paying attention to the calendar. Remembering by reflex or instinct what the holidays are, or only paying close attention then and there." I gestured. "If you're not cognizantly aware of what time's passed, things that happened drop into the background of the mind, anyway."

Iris: "Interesting theory. But, who did it? And why?"

Celestia: "K thinks I might've done it.." She was looking at me the whole time.

K: "..not calling you a liar, Celestia." I shrugged. "You told me yourself that when you go through your regeneration, you forget a LOT of things. Maybe you WANTED to forget whether or not you'd done something like that, and let it go? I'm not accusing you." I looked at Dr. Whooves. "There's at least one pony here who's a similar fate - save he can actually MEET his past selves. When HE regenerates.."

Dr. Whooves was making motions of slitting-the-throat with a desperate look on his face, telling me to SHUT UP. I was telling SEEECRETS...

[End of Part 2]


Part 3: Time to Face the Music


TIME: 11:21 Canidan Western Time (CWT) [Time is Frozen]
DATE: War Day 425/4 Sextus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Republic of Canida


K: *Deadpan* "..Smith is RIGHT THERE, isn't he?"

The First: "They can't hear you." He stepped up, and GLARED at Dr. Whooves.

K: "When'd you cut me off?"

The First: "Right after Celestia spoke." He paced towards me, and demonstrated that everyone was.. frozen in time. "No telling, K----. Those are the rules."

I stood up, and stood OVER him.

K: "Cut the crap. You're double mortal, here." I blinked. "Hello, Smith."

Fascinating. The very instant I implied a threat, The Doctor's best medicine for that (an expert in causing people to commit suicide) makes his presence known.

Mr. Smith: "Ah.. K." He walked right on over to me.

K: "There's eleven of you. I want to know what the score is." I stated flatly.

I looked at Smith and First. I wanted to know how many Incarnations were on my side. If I was a hair's breadth from being erased, or something. That could be the only reason they were all showing up, now.

The First: "8 to 3 in your favor." He cocked a brow. "He's smarter than he looks."

Mr. Smith: "If it wasn't for his violent tendencies, he might've made an excellent Companion for us!" He clapped a hoof on my shoulder.

Even though Smith hates what I am, here.. he still recognizes and respects my capability. Interesting indeed.

I wagged a finger at both of them.

K: "You're here because I'm about to spill the secret of the Time Lords, but there's something else. I think YOU guys have something to do with this!" I pointed at them both.

Four O'Clock: "My, getting crowded in here." He moved over to Smith and First. "What makes you think that, K----?"

Time Twister: "Because messing with people's heads and perceptions of time is right up my alley. OUR alley." He moved over to Dr. Whooves. "Come to think of it.. what have WE done?" He looked at each of them. "What have WE done to entire civilizations, in the name of what we thought was right?" He gestured to all three of them.

K: "Exactly what I was thinking, actually." I shrugged. "Even if unintentional."

Second Hand (2nd Doctor): "Twister is right." He nodded, stepping in himself. "What if we ARE to blame?"

K: "You're taking sides against yourself, Doctor."

I looked around and realized all eleven WERE there.. I suddenly felt, again, like a rat in a cage, surrounded by greater beings.

And I didn't let it stop me.

K: "Did.. you.. have ANY interaction with Ancient Equestria?" I pointed at The First, again falling back to my Shatneresque acting.

The First: "Apt question." He shrugged. "And if I did?"

K: "How about you answer it, first?" I looked at him nonplussed.

Five Timer (5th Doctor): "You really should." He chimed in. "K----, only 1, 4, and 7 are interested in drawing the curtain." He cocked a brow at me.

I got the message. Talk my way out of this, or I would, indeed, be ended and this whole thing would be erased, somehow, if they had the power. This was my final ideological confrontation with The Time Lords, and whatever power they actually had.

This was, in a way, worse than fighting Tirek. I was engaging mental giants with lifespans ten times mine or better. More experience, knowledge of my race, and the mental acuity to pick out my weaknesses and wound me with them. More than that, I *liked* these guys. I didn't want to hurt people I saw as friendlies, mentally or physically.

Still, I had to make my case clear. I could NOT cower before them.

K: "You can't end me. You can't stop me. You.. do not.. murder. You walk a different path. Most of you." I looked at Mr. Smith. "*You* might. Maybe. Wanna match wits? I'm not eating my pistol, yet. Or taking poison." I shrugged.

And in so doing, I'd just challenged a psycholgical grand-supreme master to a match of wits. AND called him out as him using his 'suicide talk' ability being no different than pulling the trigger himself, challenging a core part of his methodology and ethos. Forget David and Goliath, that was.. more like a squirt gun challenging The Great Chicago Fire.

Showing them all.. reminding them.. humans are wily.

Second Hand: "Better not tease him." *Chortle* "Though, I do like how worked up I'm getting, over there."

K: "DID you?" I looked right at The First, returning to the previous question before Smith could engage me.

The First: *Sigh* "After I arrived here, I made certain to erase my tracks. The Club has always existed, but I've kept moving it until recently." He gestured a little. "I don't believe I've had any effect.."

Dr. Whooves: "You could be wrong." He finally got up, and made sure to stand NEXT to me. "K---- has a legitimate interest in this world, now. As do I! I'm my own PONY, gentlemen. Not a Time Lord. Not humanoid. A PONY. I have made issue-"

Mr. Smith: "A great mistake, I think." He tugged at his scarf.

Dr. Whooves: "Oh, STUFF IT, Smith!" Oh, my!

Mr. Smith: "Where do I get off with such.. such...!"

Four O'Clock: "I can see at least one of my future selves is so wrapped up in his own hubris, he's forgotten what we really do." He shrugged. "K----, you are bold, human, and you really don't want all this violence. And you are either too foolish to care, or too brave, to cower before someone greater than you." He walked over to my side. "Your courage to stand up to me, tells me that your convictions are solid, honourable." He patted my hip. "That's two to nine, now."

The First: "I did not realise I was having a referendum." He shrugged.

Mr. Smith: "This world.."

Time Twister: "Is one we now all share. Together. While we may have been one contiguous entity before, we are now eleven seperate ones, joined by similar memories and experiences." He looked at Dr. Whooves. "And at least one of us.. me.. has come to terms with that far better than the rest of us have." He gestured to Dr. Whooves.

Dr. Whooves: "K---- is my friend. I'm not the main character, here, like I was in my own travels. He is. He and his close companions are ALL main characters in their OWN stories. And if something is interrupting their FREE WILL.." He looked right at The First.

The First: "We should have been making certain it was not our fault, or the fault of one of our adversaries that somehow found us." He shrugged and stepped over to me. "Ten to one, Smith."

Mr. Smith: "I see." He lowered his head. "I still.. I will always think that this is a huge mistake." He dismissively waved his hoof. "Congratulations, Human. You've beaten me." He grinned like a cheshire cat. "Care to take a trip with one of our next incarnations? It.. COULD be arranged." He tilted his head slightly.

K: "No. I've had enough. I mean it. Once this war is over - and without interference from any of you fine gentlemen - I would like to see if I can return home. And if not, I want to retire and make pizza." I shrugged. "Bridge on Wednesdays?"

The First: "THAT'S the spirit!" He patted me on the back. "Neither asking favor, nor promising same. Just.. intelligent company." He gestured. "I suppose this is why Dr. Whooves took such a close interest in you. And you are right - we ARE another source of influence. Fear not. I shall investigate any connection we might have, to the situation at hand. While I doubt we are in any way to blame, the fact that I have not seen hard facts with my own eyes, means I have been remiss in my duties to ensure we have zero impact on the.. course of.."

Dr. Whooves: "..that our previous status has no influence on the course of events, here, and any activities we engage in, now, are of our own free will, and are not in any way tied to that previous status, influenced by that, or result in any alteration to the world because of that." He dug The First out of a rather deep hole, there. And put a hoof on my shoulder. "There was never a rule against interaction, fraterization, or anything of that sort."

K: "Now what, though?" I looked around the room at everything frozen in time.

The First: "I'll.. take care of that." He shoo'd the others away. "..and I'll let you remember this. Just.. ah.. don't call Dr. Whooves out, okay? Explain it another way." He sagely nodded. "You can speak very well.. for a human." His own cheshire grin, and...

Part 4: A Distilled Discussion


TIME: 11:21 Canidan Western Time (CWT)
DATE: War Day 425/4 Sextus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Republic of Canida

K: "..not calling you a liar, Celestia." I shrugged. "You told me yourself that when you go through your regeneration, you forget a LOT of things. Maybe you WANTED to forget whether or not you'd done something like that, and let it go? I'm not accusing you." I gestured. "There's a lot you've forgotten, intentionally and by coincidence, and accident."

I picked up RIGHT where I left off.. and changed the last part of my statement.

I also realized that, if anyone was paying close attention, Dr. Whooves was now on the other side of Derpy. Oops!

Derpy: "Mm?" SHE did. And nuzzled him.

He murmured something into her ear that only she could hear.

She fixed me with a very small, very proud look.

Celestia: "Hm? Oh.. well.. I suppose you could be right. Whom else might be on the suspect list?" She tilted her head.

K: "Discord, Galactica Spark, some ancient mage we don't know the identity of, another unseen and unknown enemy.. we have a LARGE suspect pool.." I shrugged.

Celestia: "Indeed." She nodded. "I can only hope this isn't one of my attempts to help.. that did just the reverse."

K: "Well, it's worked for a thousand years. Problem is, there's a war on. At least it keeps our soldiers on task, and doesn't turn them into pacifists that refuse to do violence to protect themselves.." I shrugged.

Applejack: *URK!* And she galloped out!

Twilight: "I-I better.. follow her.. I have a book on pregnancy.." She trotted behind. "Applejack! I have a book, here, on what to do about-"

*THWHACK!*

*MRghferfggh*

And Twilight trotted back in, with a red mark on her ass, and the book stuffed into her mouth.

Norfy: "Let me help you, Twilight." He used his horn telekinesis to gently unjam the book from her jaw.

Celestia: *AH-hahah!* "Sometimes, my student, books don't have all the answers." She shrugged with a grin.

Twilight: *Nhgh!* "Thank you, Norfy."

Cosmic: "Ahaha.. sorry, Twilight, but that was funny." He shrugged.

Luna: "No kidding." A sigh. "Well, this has been splendid, but I must rest for my nightly duties." She rose, and trotted out towards the North Star Lodge, with Ironside close behind.

Dr. Allcome: "Any permanent damage?" He asked, with a head tilt.

Twilight: "Maybe to my pride." *Sigh*

Dr. Allcome: "Still, you girls shouldn't strain yourselves. You, too, K. You're still all recovering from your ordeal at the hands of the Herdiets." He looked at me as if to say 'you're the worst offender.'

K: "Mmmeeee?" I feigned ignorance. "Go against Doctor's orders?" I held my hand towards my chest with just the fingers touching. "Lil' ol'e meee?"

Rarity: "..that was about as convincing as Sweetie Belle.." She gave me a smile-smirk, as she departed with the rest of the girls.

Celestia: *Ahahaha!* "Oh, my, me!" She gave me a beaming grin. "K, this is why so many people like you. You're.. personable." She shrugged. "Funny, smart, brave for sure-"

K: "I'm already spoken for, Your Highness, you don't need to advertize. I have enough mare problems as it is." I smirked back at her.

Iris (to Gaze): "Is it always like this?"

Gaze (to Iris): "Aye-yup.. issa heckuva war, miss." He shrugged. "Ye'll lern." And grinned.

Cosmic (to Iris): "He's rather.. famous.. for his.." He looked at me, I hadn't been paying attention.

K: "What's up, Coz?" I nodded to him.

Cosmic: "Ohh.. nothing.."

Norfy: "He was about to make a statement to Commodore Iris about your.." He looked around and realized none of my other conquests were in the room, save Celestia. "..the fact that you can last for several hours, where as us stallions are done in perhaps a few minutes."

Iris turned BRIGHT RED. Webley just kinda shrugged - she KNEW, but it wasn't a thing to her.

Iris: "O-oh.. I get the joke, now." And started nervously sipping her drink through its straw.

Havoc: "Oh? Well!" He puffed up his chest. "At least I'm pretty sure humans don't have what WE have.."

K: "...sssooooo, Celestia." I started, changing the subject. "Chemical Splash come up with anything while I was gone? We still have those infiltrators to worry about."

Celestia: "Actually, she's due to arrive at the inbound train at three." She shrugged. "She did, in fact, say she had something important.. and wanted to discuss it with you."

K: "Okay, okay. Iris?" I looked at her, all business.

Iris: "Y-Yes, General?"

K: "Just K, please." I gave an apologetic look, as if to implore her not to let my three stallion-pals' little comments affect her.

Iris: "Yes, K?"

K: "What's the status of the Airships?" I tilted my head. "Those'll be important later, and I'm concerned about something happening to the ones we have, here."

Iris: "AH! Yes, yes." Business tone from her as well. "Well, Superb, Swiftsure, and the Excursion Vessels.. they're guarded by my Aero-Marines. Since the Crystal Kingdom is landlocked, we don't have an ocean-going navy. Our airships fill that role." She gestured to the window. "I have perhaps enough fuel for an hour's flight time for each vessel. I can adjust that with some prep work - more fuel for the small craft, for example, taken from the Air Cruisers, would give them more time aloft." She pulled out a pad. "I ran the numbers. If we drain the Excursion Vessels completely, Superb and Swiftsure would have about an hour and thirty minutes' flight time. Go the other way, and all three XY's would have about four hours' flight time, each. Economies of scale and so forth."

Sombra: "The Commodore is correct." He nodded, sagely. "And as you know, it will be several days hence before fuel is delivered here."

K: "What do you use for fuel?" I asked. Rather important question..

Frosted: "Uhmm.. fractional distillate petrol-" She started to chime in.

K: "Diesel!" I exclaimed.

Frosted: "I-I'm not familiar with the term." She shrugged.

K: "In my world, a man named Diesel invented an engine that could, unmodified, run on multiple types of fuels. Rudolf Diesel." I gestured with open arms. "I'm guessing this is some high cetane, very clean, extremely low sulfur distillate for optimum performance?"

Frosted: "Y.. yes, it is. It has a Cetane Rating of 62." She shrugged. "The engines on Superb and Swiftsure can't operate with anything that has a Cetane Rating of 43 or less. They just don't have a fast enough combustion to propel or lift the airships, with the current machinery arrangement."

K: "Is magic used in the distillate process to achieve this high cetane rating, or do you use chemical additives?"

Frosted: "It can be done both ways.. the magical route takes a highly disciplined group of ice mages to refine it." She looked at Norfy. "We heat the raw liquid mechanically, and the ice mages control the condensation temperature to produce the best possible distillate."

K: "Interesting distillation process. And the chemical additives?"

Frosted: "Derived from alchemic components, as I understand. We do pro- DID produce - a purely mechanical distillate with a CR of 49. When everything happened.. we were experimenting with a non-magical way to make purer Distillate."

K: "And the more advanced airships..?" I quizzed them both.

Iris: "HCMAS Dreadnaught was under development with an engine and machinery layout that would have allowed it to use fuel with a CR rating as low as 37." She nodded.

Frosted: "But.. it was outside of Crystalpolis.." She shrugged. "I don't honestly know where."

Iris: "*I* do.. and now that I think about it, we might be able to get there. I have no idea how well the machinery might've held up after so long."

K: "Probably not well enough to just start using it, BUT, you can copy the design and dimensions of each part as best as possible, and rebuild it.." I wagged a finger. "..just because your nation's been deprived of time, and people - ponies - is no reason you can't pick up from the mess and march forwards." I nodded to both mares.

Frosted: "You.. might be right.." She rubbed her fetlock under her chin. "..if I can just get in there and see it, I can easily copy everything.. salvage some of it, perhaps.."

Sombra: "Ladies, the Aero-Marines stand ready to assist in any capacity." He nodded to them.

K: "Side project, for when you get back to Crystalpolis. For the time being, I'd like to see if you have enough materials and a free dry dock somehow to construct another Air Crusier or something using existing tech."

Frosted: "It's not a matter of manufacturing - the capital had factories that produced all the airship components locally. The issues are, we're not GETTING the raw materials to make the manufactured components, and we no longer HAVE a proper Airship Drydock. We have a small one at the Air Port, we could use, but it's only about large enough to construct an Air Frigate." She blinked. "This is why I'm here, isn't it?"

K: "Bingo. That and a free lunch."

Frosted: "More like a working lunch!" She giggled. "Thank you, K."

K: "I'm guessing the Ice Mages come in during the Cracking and cooling phase?" I continued.

Frosted: "Yes, they help ensure that the fuel we need is distilled from the crude, condensed with the right hydrocarbons in the right chains, and that temperatures are highly controlled. This process, as I said, requires a lot of skill." She shrugged.

Norfy: "On a small scale, I might be able to do it." He looked at me. "You can't deny I'm one of the strongest Ice Mages in Equestria."

K: "You're right, but I don't want you chained to a factory for the duration." I smirked. "I need your skills and knowledge in these special projects we keep ending up on and messes we end up in."

Norfy: "Perish the thought." He nodded towards me. "I prefer a fighting unit." And shrugged. "Given that I have.." He nuzzled Radio. "..two mares to support."

K: "Yeah, I've been meaning to ask, how's Campanula doing?"

Norfy: "She's dealing with her lost leg very well. She stays active in training new Engineers. She's been fitted with a prosthesis.. of my design, actually."

K: "It's better than the helmet you made me?" I looked over.

Norfy: "It functions well. And if she wears pants and boots, one can't really tell, outside of a mild limp." He shrugged. "She's amazing. She hasn't let it stop her."

Radio: "We.. also found out that I'm infertile.." She looked down. "Side effect of being reanimated." She looked at Iris. "I was dead for a few minutes before an unknown mixture of alchemical components and energies revived me, and absorbed themselves into me. I'm.. not a unicorn, but I can use some strange magics. I'm not a Pegasus any longer, but I can levitate short distances. I'm not an Earth Pony, but I have most of their land speed, and strength."

Iris: "Oh, my!" She looked at Norfy. "You're a noble Stallion, Major."

I knew she inferred that most of society might not be as accepting of Radio and Campanula if they didn't already know them like we did. I knew it was the truth, I'd SEEN this world's racism and exclusivity.. Forest Spirit's own mild shame for not being perfect.. wounded at the same time, and while trying to save her, in fact.

Forest Spirit even tilted his head a bit away, at this conversation, but piped up.

Forest Spirit: "It's the same engagement where I was wounded here." He tapped his eyepatch. "And while trying to save Sergeant Campanula, in fact."

Norfy: "I'll forever be indebted, Spirit." He shook his head.

Forest Spirit: *Proud whinny* "Think nothing of it, old friend." And beamed.

Old friends, indeed.

Part 5: Adjustive Justice

TIME: 14:04 CWT
DATE: War Day 425/4 Sextus 1003 C.S.
LOCATION: Havoc's House, Yellowknife, Republic of Canida

I was seated in the bed, trying to read on reports from various places, about the war, and what had been going on in my absence. More concrete than what Luna could tell me in fits and spurts.

I also had a half-dozen puppies crawling all over me.

Tex: "Wheee!" He leapt off my seated shoulder, backwards, and tackled one of his sisters, who yipped at him.

Applejack: "They's cute, ain't they?" She paced in, looking better after a hot shower.

MUCH better.. I fixed her with a smirk.

Applejack: *Shhh!* "Ah'm preg'n't, r'member!?" She hissed at me.

Fizzy: "K bein' nawty! I'm'a tell Momma on yew!" She gave me the tiniest, cutest growl.

K: "Fizzy, that's.." I shrugged. "..how mommies and daddies tease each other in a loving way."

Fizzy: "Sti'w nawty!" She stuck her tongue out at me, and then dove under my hand for pettin's.

K: "Kids." I shrugged.

Applejack: "Y'never told me if'n you had one in th' human world." She got all thoughtful on me.

K: "Ehm.. by family tree, he was my nephew. My wife and I treated him like our own son, because his real mother, my wife's sister, was about as reputable in the human world as.." I looked at the window. "..she was not a good person."

Applejack: "I gets it." She shrugged and came over, mounting the bed and curling up.

The pups decided it was Nap Time and joined her.

Applejack: *Wry chuckle* "Ah'm invaded!" She nuzzled them.

Kay the Pup: "Auntieee.." He snuggled under her leg. "..y'godda tell us 'bout da warr.." He licked her face. "Awl da brave t'ings ya done!"

I concluded that Canid pups developed roughly twice as fast as Ponies and Humans. It did make sense, from an evolution standpoint. I was told I was quite the talker at about two..

Applejack: *Giggles!* "When yer older." She looked at me as if to say this was exactly what she wanted when it WAS over.

K: "At least one more." I nodded, suggesting we have a second kid at some point.

Applejack: "Mm.. Spirit's gonna be okay with that?" She tilted her head, as one of the pups got up in her hair.

K: "I'll talk to him when the time's right. I mean.." I shrugged. "..with Celestia's offer and all, I wouldn't mind having that second one ourselves."

We had decided to take Celestia up on her offer to be a mystical surrogate. While Applejack had reservations, Celestia assured her it was okay.

Applejack: *Snrk* "Yer some kin'a romantic, Honeybun." She nodded for me to come over.

So, I put down the reports and got all cuddled up in the fur pile. Most of the pups went right to sleep. Kay decided to crawl over and cuddle in my arms.


TIME: 15:07 CWT


I was awoken by Bella Donna, with a nudge.

Bella: "Chemical Splash is here. With some interesting prisoners."

K: "Prisoners?!" I got up carefully, as Kay was still clung to me.

Bella: "Go on. I'll replace the warm." She said, getting curled up in the pile.

I got up, as Havoc came over to hand me my gear.

Havoc: "Somethin' to be said for both our ladies being so friendly."

K: "Maybe Bella will get to experience a piece of what you did when you were at Paradise Estates." I shrugged, putting Colonel Willaims' M-19 on in its crossdraw holster.

Havoc: "Stay comfy, love." He nodded to Bella.

K: "AJ's asleep, or I'd say something to her, too." I just blew her a kiss.

Havoc: "So, you think this might be the ones involved in stealing your technology?" He tilted his head as he pulled on his Canidan Ranger sweater top.

K: "Hope so. Splash came highly recommended." I put on a jacket, as Spring, up here, wasn't all that warm.

Havoc: "Well, let's go see." He tucked his C-1 pistol in its holster at his hip area, and off we went.

Splash wasn't hard to find. She had ten Gendarmes from Coltago, and five from Canterlot helping her. Among them was Inspector Wide Lens, from Canterlot, a former part-time journalistic investigator and photographer.

Splash: "You know, General, you did not give me an official rank in the Gendarmes - I've been getting by on your word and my Badge Number being Number 1."

K: "You want the job of Commissioner?" I joked.

Splash: "Absolutely not. I want field work, not desk work."

K: "Captain, then." I nodded to her.

Splash: "Functional." She nodded back.

K: "The prisoners?" I asked.

Splash: "An interesting group. Bring them forward, Inspector." She nodded.

The Gendarmes brought forwards a pale grey Unicorn pony with a shaved mohawk mane reminiscent of a Zebra's, wearing a black leather jacket and leather short boots on his rear legs. Next to him was a Donkey. The Donkey was dressed in a three piece suit, that was suitably slightly torn, wrinkled, and mussed up. He has a proper pony-sized fedora, and a mane that was once slicked, but was now mussed up. The third was a Griffon who wore black pants, a white vest, and once had a false collar and black necktie, which was now stuffed in a vest pocket.

The last prisoner, however, was a Gizmonk. He was dressed simply - dark pants, dark top that vaguely resembled a gi. The top has a hood. What disturbed me most was the shoes he was wearing. As most Equus species ran around barefoot/hooved most of the time, anything resembling footwear was something I'd been noting. No, this Gizmonk was wearing modern tennis shoes that closely resembled Converse sneakers - dark canvas, dark tan rubber gum sole, greyish rubberized toe, grey laces.

K: "Where'd you get those shoes?" I pointed.

Gizmonk: "Fuck off, human." He narrowed his eyes at me.

K: "And learn to speak like that?" I tilted my head.

Gizmonk: "Fuck. Off." He would have crossed his arms, but he was restrained in full shackles at ankle-and-wrist with a length of chain in the middle.

K: "Pull him aside." I pointed. "Splash, what's going on here?"

Capt. Splash: "After a very thorough investigation, I figured out that these three members of the Mondari crime gang, and this.. creature.. were responsible for the intelligence leaks." She indicated the Donkey. "This is Bowegi Bucateri, he's a master at putting heist crews together, and is the leader of the three." Then, to the Griffon. "This is Kelkam, master lockpicker. Note that I've encased his griffon claws in thick wrappings and capped the tips with steel cups." Then, the Pony. "This is Breaker Barrels. Known criminal, usually a lookout man, but as a Unicorn, he's been known to deal in and use various mystical artifacts."

K: "I see." I nodded. "These three have been interrogated, and such?" I shrugged. "For that matter, as sentients accused of a crime, do they have any Civil Rights under Equestrian Law?"

Insp. Lens: "The accused have a right to legal representation at no expense to them before or during any questioning by civil authorities, and the right to legal representation at any trial arising from said questioning and accusation. They have, also, the right to know the charge against them, and the right to face their direct accusers in court-" He was cut off.

Splash: "In this case, me." She nodded to the side, with lids half-shut, smugly. "They've not yet been questioned. Of note, Kelkam and this strange creature are not Equestrian citizens. As Kelkam is an Outcast Griffon, he's dealt with slightly differently - the Equestrian State has the option of deporting him to Griffon territory, or prosecuting him as an illegal alien."

K: "You know your stuff." I nodded, and shrugged. "Prosecute the pony and the donkey. I'm declaring the Griffon an enemy spy, and under miltary jurisdiction." I looked over at Lyra. "Lyra, turn him into a feather duster. Espionage is an executable-"

Kelkam: "WHAT!? You can't be serious!!"

Capt. Splash: "GENERAL! That is a SERIOUS breach of legal protocol! I-"

I whipped out the M-19 and stuck it under Kelkam's chin, flicking the hammer back.

K: "One chance. Who set this up?" I looked him right in the eyes, with ice and murder in my gaze.

Kelkam: "Outside contract! Some guy named Scorpan came to us before the war and promised Bowegi big bits if he could put together a heist crew! But.. we weren't to steal nothin' - just record everything!" He looked fit to piss himself.

K: "Hmm." I decocked the hammer. "Alright. Prosecute him, too." I shrugged and reholstered. "I want the book thrown at these three. What's the punishment for treason to Celestia?" I asked.

Insp. Lens: "Life imprisonment or executio-" He looked at Breaker.

K: "Charge him with treason, but I advise against the death penalty. You know what you're doing, Inspector Lens?" I nodded to him, smugly.

Insp. Lens: "Yes, K." He nodded.

K: "Make sure the charges for Bowegi and Kelkam carry a minimum thirty years. And I want that done in solitary confinement." I looked at them coldly. "I should have you.." I pointed at Barrel Breaker. "..and you.." And to Kelkam. "..executed for your crimes. Consider my recommendations a gift."

Barrel Breaker: "This is CRAZY!" He stamped a hoof. "All we did was copy yer blueprints!!"

K: "YOUR CRIMES LED TO THE DEATHS OF THOUSANDS OF EQUESTRIANS! YOUR CRIMES ALLOWED MY BEST FRIEND TO BE RAPED TWICE! YOUR CRIMES ALLOWED MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTH PARENTS TO BE KILLED! YOUR CRIMES LED TO THE SLAUGHTER AT CHOWSIN RIDGE! YOU. ARE. DIRECTLY. RESPONSIBLE. FOR. EVERY. LIFE. ENDED!" I screamed at them. "You DAMN well better thank the fact that this place has made me a MUCH nicer person, or I'd order these ponies to hold you down, while I PERSONALLY GUTTED AND SKINNED EACH ONE OF YOU ALIVE!!"

Insp. Lens: "And we would, too. My little brother died at Chowsin, and my sister died in Canterlot." He shook his head.

Capt. Splash: "..I.." She looked.. disturbed. "I never thought about... that." She paced off. "Lens has my findings.."

K: "Get these scum out of my sight. They're soiling these pure Canidan lands." I jerked a hand in their direction.

Havoc: "Take them to the City Constable's office." He nodded. "Right up that street. You can hold them there until the train arrives in the morning. The Constable will see you guys have a place for the night as well." He glanced at me. "Shame you didn't want 'em killed.." He leered at Bowegi. "Donkey's fine eatin'."

Bowegi lost it at that point, and pissed himself so hard, his fine pants started dripping at the ankles.

I went off to confront Chemical Splash. I found her in the nearby saloon, with a bottle of Canidan spirits, and a glass. I knew that alcohol consumption was a thing ever since Berry Punch.. I just hadn't paid attention to how prevalent it was.

She sat in a seat, staring at the full glass.

K: "Never considerd people have died, have you?" I sat next to her.

Capt. Splash: "No, sir." She was short with her answers.

K: "You've spent too much time thinking about the science of crime, and not enough time with the victims of it. And now, you realize, every Equus citizen is a victim of what looked like simple espionage." I shrugged. "The detachment from emotional entanglement, I get. But, have you ever had a real friend? Or do they just get in the way."

Capt. Splash: "The latter." She was short again, still staring at the alcohol.

K: "You haven't had a drop, have you?"

Capt. Splash: "No, sir."

K: "Because you know how badly your brain will suffer once you consume it." I nodded at it.

Capt. Splash: "Yes, sir."

K: "You're no different than someone threatening to jump off a roof, right now. Because you know, to yourself, that if you drink that, you'll never trust another thing you deduce ever again."

Capt. Splash: "H-How..?" She looked at me, then tears started coming from her eyes.

K: "It's okay, Chem. It's okay. I know this story all too well. You had a gift that was unlike anything else anyone in your age group ever had. It made you wierd, it made you strange, it made them ostracize you. You had no friends, so you decided that you didn't need them. Your initial isolation caused you to further isolate yourself, until that isolation was complete. You built up this air of intellectualism, refinement, and culture. Scientific mastery. Something very few other ponies even considered worth their time - as their talents were based on magic, friendship, customer service, socialization, and consumerism. You made yourself, in your mind, above all that, to justify the idea you didn't need anyone." I was staring straight ahead. "That.. I didn't need anyone."

Chem: "S-Sir?" She stammered.

K: "I know your story because, in some ways, it was my own. I had a talent for something called Information Technology, and in my age group, it wasn't seen as anything more than a consumerist tool - not something that needed mastery. And those that sought it, were branded Nerds in a society that worshipped more phyiscal prowess than intellectual." I shrugged. "I finally crawled out of my shell once I got some help with other issues that.." I looked at her. "..made me isolate myself from others for other reasons. I found, through this technology, my path to making friends. And eventually, finding my human wife." I shrugged. "I adapted. But, there are, out there, so many other humans that were ostracized and isolated from The In Crowd for many other social slights, like enjoying socially unacceptable entertainment, or obession with things that had little logical value, or whatever. We called these people various names, but Neckbeard was one that was both an insult and a compliment to those so tagged. They had - have - feelings like your own. They seek the company of others, and in order to find the companionship they so desperately need, they debase themselves in the most humiliating ways." I looked around the room, a little. "These people spiral so far down the path to depression and isolation, that they revel in their own suffering and situation, even though they dream of a happier life. They won't find it unless they discard all the negative things they've acquired about themselves, and work to integrate into the greater society as a whole. Instead, though, they make themselves outcasts, and without an event that wakes them out of their daydream, they will continue to be on the outside of regular society, and without that happiness."

Quite the speech.

Chem: "..and I'm the same way." She lowered her head. "But, I don't want to give up on my special talent!"

K: "I'm not saying you have to. I am, however, saying that you really should get out more often. Ask Lens, I know he needs a friend. He's lost two of his siblings in this war. To him, you're probably a bit of a hero, since you caught the ones most responsible for this mess. Reach out to him, go out with him, enjoy yourself. Find fun distractions that do nothing logical, or logically beneficial to anyone but your own joy. Find a reason to laugh, to love, to be social. You Ponies are far more dependant on socialization than humans are, for good mental health. Go out and DO something that makes you feel silly and tingly inside!" I waved a hand around.

Chem: "You're right." She set the drink down. "I can't believe I just had a human tell me and show me.. what a fool I've been." She shook her head. "I'm sorry, K. I didn't think you.."

K: "You didn't consider me an intellectual equal." I shrugged. "It has its paralells.."

With that, Chem went outside.. truly WENT outside for the first time since, I thought, she was a filly. I followed, and watched her.. watched her try to remember how to act socially with others. Approach Lens. Talk to Lens. Ask him out.

And SMILE.
