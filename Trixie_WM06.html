08:07AM, Canterlot Royal Time
Dusk's Apartment


Trixie was excited. It seemed the new year was going to bring her some decent luck for once. Dusk was due in to the office at nine, and the two of them were having breakfast when she dropped the news on him.

Trixie: "So, you know that concert that's coming up? Coloratura and.. all those other groups and things? The Midwinter celebration?" She leaned in over her bowl of cereal.

Dusk: "Yeaaah.. we're going to be protecting that. Princess Luna wanted to attend, since it's in the evening." He nodded.

Trixie: "Well.." She handed him a copy of Equestria's most published music 'zine, Harmonic Grooves.

In the current edition's section of an ongoing coverage arc, titled "Soundwave Surge," The Dazzlings are on the cover, and the featured musical group.

Dusk: "Okay, I see.." He nodded.

Trixie: "Page 16." She used her magic to flip it to there.

Dusk: "...an appearance at the Midwinter Jamboree Festival on January 17'th.." He rubbed his chin. "Since I'm guarding that.." He looked at her. "Did you want tickets? I mean, I wanted to get one for Rarity.."

She handed him her phone, with an E-Mail open, and the SMUGGEST look.

Dusk looked at it and shrugged, then read it again. According to the E-Mail, she was accepted as one of the variety acts that would take place between each musical group's sets. Her place was right after The Dazzlings, and before Pop Mega-Star Coloratura, about two hours into the show.

Dusk: "...wait, you're going to be one of the main acts?!" He looked up at her, and she was beaming a grin.

Trixie: "Indeed! The GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie..!" She giggled a bit. "I'm so excited. This is a huge chance for me."

Dusk: "And the pay.. is certainly something." He blinked. "2400 bits? That's a lot of money."

Trixie: "Oh, it's not just that." She shrugged. "The exposure! Think about it. How many gigs this can lead to!" She clapped her hands.

Dusk: "It does sound good." He nodded. "The Dazzlings.. yeah.. it's their production company that's going to be organizing this." And shrugged, finishing his bacon.

Trixie: "It's in almost two weeks. I need to plan my act. They want at least twenty minutes of content so they have time to set the stage up for the following act." She smirked. "I'm thinking I'm going to go for at least one Escape trick.." And gently rubbed her jaw.

Dusk: "Well, the princess loves magic tricks like that. She'll be happy, at least." He shrugged.

Trixie: "Ooo. Maybe you can get me a gig at the palace if this goes well." She smiled.

Dusk: "Ehh.. Luna does like an occasional festivity night." He shrugged, smiling. "I gotta get going." He got up, dumped his plate in the dishwasher after shaking it out in the trash, grabbed his beret and jacket, and headed out.

Trixie, meanwhile, sat there and pondered her situation, smiling to herself. She'd have to come up with a pretty amazing act in order to wow all the audience, AND hopefully get her a leg up in the entertainment world. She didn't mind the thought of steady, lower-paying gigs at birthdays, weddings, and things like that. What bothered her was not working at all. Magic was what she knew best. It was her one shot at doing something decent with her life.


11:37AM, Canterlot Royal Time
Dazzle Productions Offices


Trixie stepped into the offices, smiling, and wearing something pretty-but-conservative, to match the vibe. A short dress with stars on it, nylons matching her belt, kitten heels, and a jacket/coat with thick shoulders and a slightly long bottom, to give a hint of a magician's costume, without outright saying it. She hummed a bit to herself, with the E-Mail in hand, on her phone, as she came up to the front desk.

Noteworthy: "Hey. Noteworthy. Do you have an appointment?" He was brusque, but not unfriendly.

Trixie: "Trixie Lulamoon." She held up the E-Mail. "Someone from Talents wanted to see me today, if possible, and go over what I might want to have in my act. You know, make sure I don't break any rules." She shrugged. "Been around this block before."

Noteworthy: "Oh. Okay, go have a seat in the Talent Lounge and I'll see who's available." He pointed to the side lounge, and remotely unlocked the door from the desk.

She noted, they had good security - probably because fans would run into these side rooms and lock themselves for a publicity stunt or something. She went in, and noted that while it was a rather common-tier waiting area, with trendy-but-cheap furnishings, free coffee, and donuts, with a soda machine, it wasn't terribly lush. Made sense - she was probably one of many low end talents they got in here, and since she wasn't a big name, there was no need to hyper impress her.

She relaxed on one of the sofas, for the moment, took advantage of the free charger station, and started playing a game on her phone. She was sure she was low priority, so, she'd likely be here a bit. She smiled, though - the job was guaranteed, she just needed to run some ideas past whomever they were going to have talk to her.

After a while (over an hour), Noteworthy came back in and motioned to her.

Trixie: "Yup." She hopped up, and followed him into the office area.

She was led to the office of "Dance Fever - External Talents Specialist." The inside of the office seemed to be from the 970's, and never once updated.

Dance Fever: "Yo, foxy lady. Take a seat." He smirked, leaning over his desk a bit.

It was a nonstandard 'blob' shape desk, very 970's styled, along with everything else in here, right down to his necked desk lamp. There was also carpet on the walls. Really, this place was so.. outdated.. that it was novel and chic again, having gone around the circle of fashion past "outdated" and elevated beyond "retro."

Trixie sat in the hand-shaped seat, crossed her legs, and smiled her best 'dealing with the suits' smile.

Trixie: "Hey, babe. I've been here before." She shrugged. "Give me the four-one-one on what I can and can't do, anything special you'd like, and I won't have to waste your valuable time. A handsome stallion like you, surely has many more foxy ladies he wants to see today, hmmmmmm?" She leaned into that, and leaned towards him a bit.

Dance Fever: "Down to business." He nodded, grinning. "I like that. Get'cha a drink?" He shrugged.

Trixie: "Nah, I'm good. I gotta drive." She shrugged.

Dance Fever: "Alright, alright. Mineral water?" He shrugged.

Trixie: "That'll do." She nodded.

Sensing she was no floozy, he reached over to a very retro fridge, grabbed one of the small sealed bottles of mineral water, and handed it to her.

Trixie, likewise, nodded to this, and him, opening it, and taking a dainty sip, followed by a smile.

Dance Fever: "Now, we need 20 minutes of content. You said this is no problem. Considering what happened at the Senate dinner last month, the suits are a little skeeved about you using pyrotechnics too much, but if you got no problem with our own boys doing the fire, we'll work something out. As for content? It's a magic act - we don't expect anything sexual or bloody." He gestured, getting to business, and dispensing with the formalities and flirtations.

Trixie: "I'd like a simple spark shower when I come on stage, and another to see me off." She shrugged. "You're not the only one skeeved about pyros. Mine were tampered with, when this happened. I've cut back, unless I know everyone involved in them."

Dance Fever: "Mmm.. understandable." He gestured. "Are you planning anything dangerous or anything that might need stage hands?"

Trixie: "For something like this, I do want to do an escape trick, but I'll.. NOT use the upside down water tower for this." She smirked, confidently. "I'm thinking a simple straight jacket escape with disappearing. Instead of Pyros, I can use horn magic to make the effect - much more safe."

Dance Fever: "Sounds good." He nodded slowly. "Anything else?"

Trixie: "Eh, mostly showy stuff." She shrugged, hand upturned. "You want a big show, you're giving me a chance, and you're putting me between the two biggest acts. I'll deliver. You'll get a full list of my tricks in an E-Mail by tomorrow evening, along with a basic description."

Dance Fever: "No problems, then." He nodded. "Alright. We have your employment contract here." He pulled it out and slid it over. "The event has medical coverage if anything goes wrong."

Trixie: "Alright, no problem." She smiled.

After looking over the contracts, and signing them, they got notarized, and the deal was sealed. Once this was done, she got herself gathered up, and got ready to depart, when Dance Fever handed her his other business card.

Dance Fever: "You.. need an agent.. if this goes well, hit me up. I book gigs on the side." He shrugged with a small grin.

Trixie: "Oh, thank you!" She smiled at him, being nice. "I'll keep you in mind." She floofed her hair a bit, and departed.

Trixie was grinning ear to ear. This might be the ticket. This might be IT - the chance for financial independence! It might even allow her to get her car fixed completely! So, she spent the night and most of the next day meticulously planning her act. Exactly which tricks to use, when, and which ones can be skipped if a Trick takes too long to perform, or something else happens.

Her E-Mailed list of Tricks and their descriptions were accepted by the production company, and more importantly, by their personal injury law advisors.

While the concert was on the 17th, the production company wanted to stage a basic rehearsal for the event on the 12th. Trixie was sure to attend..


January 12, 1012 C.S.
9:00AM, Canterlot Royal Time
Grand Amphitheatre Grounds, Canterlot


In the grounds of the Amphitheatre, most of the frames were set up already for the practice dry run, and there were trailers set out for the talents. Trixie just parked her car over to the side. The side talents, like her, had use of a medium sized building near the stages. Getting inside with her smaller trunk, she checked out some of the other acts.

Two slam-dance acrobats were practicing on one side. Another was an animal act. One was a comedian. She smiled - no one of the talents would be a challenge to the others. Good job on the production company, and it also meant she'd be the only magic show.

She set her trunk down, and went outside to fetch her other one, when she overheard...


???: P> "No.. no, Maurice, I'm -not- happy. Sven is.. he's just a DICK!" There is a pause. "You're my lawyer. Get me out of the contract." Another, longer pause. "I don't CARE! I can't stand all of this!"

Trixie, for her part, remained hidden around the corner, but she slid out one of her trick mirrors so she could see around it. The girl talking was none other than Coloratura!

Coloratura: P> "Maurice, do you know the last time I went out just to go out? To have fu-" She paused. "Yes, famous pop stars can have fun besides going to galas and wearing fifty thousand bit dresses." And paused once again. "I don't know! Just.. get an ice cream or something!" She hissed. "Look, get me OUT of this. I don't CARE how! Good BYE!" She beeped off her phone and gave an aggrivated sigh.

From around the corner, Trixie slid the mirror away, and once again, her mouth decided to act before her brain could think better of it.

Trixie: "You know, there's a nice ice cream and soda shop about three blocks from here." She said, before confidently sliding around the corner. "Trixie." She extended her hand.

Coloratura: "Oh.. ah.." She blushed a bit, and took her hand, grasping it with her other hand as well. "..you heard that?"

Trixie: "Yep." She nodded. "YOU need a break, girl." She grinned, confidently.

Coloratura: "You.. do you know who I am?!?" She seemed a bit shocked that Trixie would say such a thing, like she could go into public and NOT cause a riot!

Trixie: "Yep! That's why.. you need a little magic." She waved her hand, and cast a masking and color changing spell over Coloratura's eyes and hair, rendering her blonde and blue eyed.

Coloratura: "Magic..?" She felt her hair get all tingly, and whipped out her compact. "Magic..!" She smiled.

Trixie: "Come on... Star Song. Let's go get ice cream." She smirked. "My treat." Even a fake name to go with the new look...


10:21AM
Whipped Peaks Ice Cream


"Star Song": "And then, I told him, look, if you're going to put me next to the CEO of the record label, at least have the decency to give me some earplugs, so I don't hear his snoring." She giggled.

Trixie: "Oh, gosh." She laughed, and finished the last of her chocoalte soda. "I wish I had it as boring as that." She shook her head.

"Star Song": "Yeah.. my life used to be boring." She frowned. "Now, it's not." She scoffed, but looked at her watch. "We really should go to the Dry Run." She looked a bit saddened.

Trixie: "We.. should.. oooooooorrrrrrrrrrrr..." She leaned over the table. "When's the last time you just cut loose and went to the mall to window shop?" She smiled broadly, genuinely excited.

"Star Song": "Hah!" She smiled a bit. "..years?" She shrugged. "Sven is going to be pissed."

Trixie: "Sounds like he deserves to be." She fixed her with a look of mischief, wiggling her brow.

"Star Song": "..oh, horsefeathers! Let's go!" She cheered, and stood up, letting Trixie take the lead back to Trixie's car.

Trixie: "Again, sorry my ride isn't a Mazeratti.. or even.. you know.. less than 15 years old." She shrugged.

"Star Song": "Oh, it's fine, Trixie. It.. kinda reminds me of my mom and dad's car." She ran her hand over the hood a moment, and smiled. "Going to camp every summer."

Trixie: "..I could never." She looked at her car. "I grew up in a trailer park." She shrugged.

"Star Song": "HAH! Funny enough? Me, too." She smiled. "I had a good aunt, though, she made sure I could go every summer." She clasped Trixie's hands. "Macaroni and cheese.."

Both: "WITH GOVERNMENT CHEESE!"

Trixie: "Aw, man, you're one of the good ones." She smiled. "Come on!"

With that, the girls got into the car, and drove off to the mall. Along the way, Trixie put in some older music from her tape collection, and they sang along to the tunes. Though they'd just met, they bonded quickly over their shared and similar pasts.


11:02
East Canterlot Royal Shopping Mall


They practically ran in, and like a pair of absolute munchkins, they started running this way and that, looking at the shops and things in the windows. They started on the fashion area...

Trixie: "Oh, look at this!" She stared through the window at a pair of hyper expensive jeans that looked like hot garbage. "Why are they charging 1,500 bits? This looks like jeans that got attacked by part of a Jester's pants!"

"Star Song": "I have no idea." She frowned. "At least I'm not being forced ot wear them." She shrugged.

Trixie: "Forced to wear them?" She cocked a brow.

"Star Song": "Eh. My manager got me into so many bad deals. I have to wear certain clothes at certain public appearances, I have to wear certain perfumes, the works." She shrugged. "Worse.." She trailed off.

Trixie: "What's worse?" She shrugged, then pointed at a sweater that looked like a goose had been sewn into it, and the neck of the goose formed some half-assed scarf. "Oh, Holy Celestia, that's bad!"

"Star Song": "..ah." She frowned, then looked up at her new friend. "You know? Maybe you'll get it." She shrugged. "I love singing, but Sven makes me sing songs specifically tailored to be hits. Like, run through a computer and everything. I don't get to write any of my own stuff, like I used to." She slowly shook her head. "I have this GREAT song I want to sing.. but he won't let me. He says the algorithm rejected it, big time." She scowled. "That's why I want to get away from him."

Trixie: "How much trouble would you be in, if you sang a song not approved? Like, just did it live, and say, screw that guy?" She gave her a cheeky look.

"Star Song": "Probably get a Breach of Contract suit." She shrugged. "Cost me a few million bucks. Maybe everything."

Trixie: "At this point, is that such a bad thing?" She shrugged, with one palm up.

"Star Song": "..maybe it isn't." She blinked and looked down.

Trixie: "Come on, let's go to the Food Court and write the biggest Fuck You, I Quit ever sung!" She grabbed her hand, and "Star Song" immediately giggled devilishly, as she pulled her towards the Food Court.


January 14, 1012 C.S.
10:37AM
Grand Amphitheatre Grounds, Canterlot


Sven Gallop: "Where WERE you two, two days ago?!" He came at them both immediately.

Trixie and Coloratura had sat down and written one of the best songs that Coloratura thought she'd ever written. Trixie even agreed to do backing vocals, despite being out of practice. So, they'd spend the 13th doing just that - refreshing Trixie's pipes. Another thing she'd attempted a long time ago, but failed at.

Now, they were back for the second dry run. Sven Gallop, Coloratura's manager, was.. displeased.

Coloratura: "Practicing." She put on her arrogant air immediately, with him. "I liked her voice. I want her on stage with me for one of the numbers. She DOES have an EEAG card." She snorted at Sven.

An Equestria Entertainers and Actor's Guild Card means you're paying your dues to be allowed to partake in anything the EEAG covers. From doing walk-on bit parts in film, to singing, to.. of course.. sanctioned entertainment acts like hers. To perform at any venue like this one, one must have an EEAG Card, or pay a one-time fee to participate (usually deducted from agreed pay).

Sven Gallop: *Growl* "That's not the point. And don't give me that attitude!" He shot back at her. "The Dazzlings were furious they couldn't do their full dry run." He limp-wristedly gave her a dismissive wave. "Whatever. They're here today. The 15th is the full practice run. Do you remember your synch list?"

Coloratura: "I do. I'll be singing Grand Day Aria manually, with her on backing vocals." She pointed at Trixie. "She has a gift, Sven, and YOU'RE the one always complaining you can't find more talent." She retorted.

Trixie, for her part, stayed smug, as Coloratura had warned her to. Show no weakness, as while Sven may be a bit effete, he was an absolute shark and emotionally abusive when he could be.

Sven: "Alright." He grunted, but leaned in on Trixie. "You BETTER be GOOD." He hissed. "Screw this up, you'll never work in this town again!" He stuck a finger in her face.

Trixie: "I'll be better than good. The Grrrrreat and POWERFUL Trixie.. will be the best." She cattily slunk her shoulder at him, did a half-twirl, and departed to go prepare for her dry run.

Sven could only make a small grunt at her display.

The practice on this day consisted of everyone running through their acts one at a time, at a slower speed than normal, so the stage crew and directors could gauge if the timing would work. Coloratura and Trixie pretended to do a different song than the one they actually intended to use.

Trixie's magic act was not only flawless, but entertaining enough that other crew members stopped what they were doing to watch. Even the members of the Dazzlings were impressed...

Sonata Dusk: "..not bad, I suppose." She smirked.

Adagio: "That's actually pretty decent." She smiled, as Triixe finished. "I guess our management agency was right to get you." She stuck out her hand. "Adagio. This is Sonata and Aria."

Trixie: "Trixie." She smiled. "I HAVE to be good, to follow YOUR act. That was sensational, even without the speakers on. Do you always sing live?" She tilted her head. "I hear at least some artists just lip-synch."

Aria: "Oh! Some DO!" She beamed a grin. "We don't." She giggled a bit. "Hey, Dagi.. can we go get fish tacos, now? I'm STARVED! And maybe some anchovy ice cream!" She grabbed Adagio by the sleeve.

Adagio: "..eh, alright." She shrugged. "Good practice today." She nodded to Trixie and Coloratura. "I'm glad to see the superstar Coloratura.. does not disappoint.." She cocked a brow, and departed with her two band-mates.

After they left, Trixie shrugged to Coloratura.

Trixie: "Something seem.. off about them?" She looked at her.

Coloratura: "Eh." She shrugged. "Maybe. Maybe they're just weird. Lots of famous people are."

Trixie: "I don't know.." She pursed her lips.


4:12PM
Dusk's Apartment, Canterlot


Trixie came home with sausage rolls and biscuits. A little take away from the huge buffet to feed the talents. Dusk was already home, after a day of training. Trixie slid in, and handed him a big, fat, sausage roll, wrapped in wax paper.

Dusk: "Nice. Still warm, too." He smiled.

Trixie: "Dusk.." She lowered her head. "..mmm, it's nothing, never mind."

Dusk: "Uh-huh..?" He tilted his head. "What is it?"

Trixie: "Maybe I'm getting paranoid, but I think something's up with The Dazzlings. They feel.. soooo.. off." She shrugged. "And they're obsessed with eating fish." She frowned.

Dusk: "Oh?" He leaned forwads, and got up, stretching. "Obsessed? Like, beyond a fad diet thing?" He tilted his head.

Trixie: "Yes." She nodded firmly. "I think something's up." She frowned. "I hate to think a famous band like the Dazzlings are doing something crazy.. but.." She sat down next to where he'd sat. "I saw things today that just make me feel.. nervous. Like, they acted and moved and sang in.. just an odd way." She shook her head, munching a biscuit. "They seemed obsessed with things, too. Odd things. Like, where the Princess was going to sit, who's going to be with her, that sort of thing."

Dusk: "Okay, that DOES sound odd." He nodded. "I'll keep it in mind, and talk to her Security Detail."

Trixie: "Are you her close proteciton?" She slid across the couch, crawling almost, getting comfortable.

Dusk: "We're the extraction team." He nodded. "We're trying to get more Nightwatch trained up and in place to replace the missing members." Then gently grabbed Trixie's leg before she could knock over a soda. "The Secret Service has responsibility for Luna directly.. and Celestia, of course."

Trixie: "So, we're fine, then." She nodded.

Dusk: "Yeah, we should be fine." He gestured. "All the same, ever since you got back to town, we've been.. you've.. been.. the center of a lot of trouble. So, be careful."

Trixie: "Eh, I'll be okay." She smiled.

Dusk: "..oh, have you taken your meds?" After all that's happened, the doctor prescribed some anti-anxiety meds, temporarily.

Trixie: "Oh, yeah." She dug into her purse, and fished them out. "Good thinking." She blinked, and fished one out, chasing it with soda.

Dusk: "You okay? After everything that's been happening, this must have you stressed out." He leaned over her.

Trixie: "..I'll be okay." She blinked a bit, smiling. "After this, they'll all love me." She said, quietly.

Dusk, however, wasn't so sure. He wasn't sure this was the key, the cure to her meloncholy, that had hung over her since her arrival, and worse yet, the dangers she's encountered. Did she feel responsible? Did she feel like it was all her fault? He didn't know for sure.

And she wasn't talking.

Of all the things that'd happened lately, Trixie not opening up was probably the thing that bothered him the most. Growing up, they confided their deepest secrets and fears to each other. Now? Trixie felt like.. it felt as though she was triyng to take all these problems onto herself, and not let anyone else in. It hurt him, that she didn't feel like she could open up, honestly, and genuinely, with him, any more.

Was it because of Rarity? He didn't know for sure.

As the date of the concert approached, everyone prepared. Trixie practiced her singing and her magic act. Dusk trained TacTeam 6 in every possible situation, and drilled them on evacuating Luna if an emergency arose.

Both would have to be at their best.

Neither of them knew what the concert itself would offer.


January 17th, 1012 C.S.
7:27PM
Grand Amphitheatre Grounds, Canterlot

The opening acts were alreaddy on stage and performing. Trixie was all prepared, and back stage with her things. But, something bothered her. Something had been tugging at her since she met The Dazzlings. So, she went out to the back stage area, and towards their dressing room.

Trixie: "This is crazy. There's nothing wrong, here, it's just.." She shook her head, talking to herself. "I'm just being paranoid."

Self doubt, but, Trixie just could not shake the feeling that something was terribly off about The Dazzlings. She wasn't quite sure what it was, but her mind was racing to think of who or what could be at play, here?

She stopped at the door to their dressing room. It was slightly open.

Adagio: "..and once we hit the crescendo of the song, the gems should have enough power to do the job."

Aria: "Are you sure? We can't afford mistakes. If even one of those Nightwatch aren't listening..."

Adagio: "And that's why I arranged to have the song piped through their coms channels." She could he heard giggling. "They won't stand a chance."

Sonata: "Mmmm.. fish tacos." She could be heard, eating.

Adagio: "IS THAT ALL YOU THINK ABOUT?!" She was cross.

Sonata: "Mmm.. sometimes I think about barbecued shrimp!" She giggled.

Aria: "All this, to unseat Coloratura." She changed the subject.

Adagio: "Look, if we're going to be the best band in Equestria - the number one music act - then we have to eliminate the competition. One way or another. And hypnotizing Luna and her guards to call her out while she's trying to perform? And call her music trash? Perfect." She giggled. "On the plus side, our mysterious benefactor will have Luna in our clutches afterwards, for whatever they want her for."

Trixie had heard enough. She went to take a step back, and tripped over one of the stage lights, knocking it over. This caused a lot of noise, and ended up with Trixie on her great and powerful bum

Trixie: "...oh, shit." She profaned, as the door was thrown open.

Adagio: "A LITTLE SPY, HUH?!" She yelled. "ARIA!"

Trixie got to her feet quickly, and charged a simple shove spell, stepping back carefully.

Trixie: "Good plan, Adagio - you want to be Number One, and you don't want anyone in your way. Problem is, Coloratura's quitting the fame and fortune biz tonight, anyway!" She snorted. "Shame you didn't have the patience to wait."

Adagio: "Why would she do THAT?!" Adagio demanded.

Trixie: "Because she's sick and tired of being used to earn people money, and not being able to write the songs she wants." She looked down a bit, sadly.

Sonata: "Awww.. that's so sad! Everyone should enjoy music! Well, our music, anyway." She giggled.

Adagio: "A fine lie, little spy, but true or not, we can't let you warn anyone." She started to advance on her. "Come on, girls. Time to make this magician... disappear. Forever." She cackled.

Trixie fired the Push spell, and managed to scramble away towards the equipment area. Unfortunately, this was even more deserted than the dressing room hallway.

The Dazzlings gave chase.

She slid into a small closet, and texted Dusk.

{Text Message: Trixie (7:34)} - Dazzlings plan to hypno Luna. Music. Going thru ur comms.

She didn't know if he'd understand the message, but she did think they were up to something, so, if he GOT the message, he'd take it seriously.

She slid from the equipment area closet, to the ropeway behind it, where spare curtains were hung up. It was a maze back here - and she hoped that would work in her favor.

It didn't take long for them to catch up to where she was, and stalk her. Like an animal.

Adagio: "Come out, come out where ever you are!" She sing-songy demanded. "...fine. We'll do this the hard way, then."

The Dazzlings took a moment to Harmonize, but began singing.

Dazzlings: "Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh
        You need to know that you fell
        Oh-whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh
        Need you to fall under our spell

        Blindsided by the beat
        Clapping your hands, stomping your feet
        You wouldn't know that you'll fall.."

Trixie: "YOU'RE SIRENS!" She yelled, holding her hands over her ears, the sudden realziation hitting her like a ton of bicks - to say nothing of the spell that was attacking her ears. "Ahhh.. I.." She then fell to her knees. "..can't.."

She could feel her will power slipping away. Even trying to Counter Spell the music wasn't working - conventional magic wouldn't, against sonic magic. She knew that, but she tried it, anyway. Her spell fizzled as it left her horn.

She could slowly feel herself succumbing.. losing herself.. seeing only them..

Starlight: "WHY DON'T YOU THREE SHUT UP?!" Came the scream from behind them.

Trixie had the strength to raise her head and look - Coloratura and Starlight Glimmer were both there. And Starlight was looking extra smug. The Dazzlings turned and started singing at them, instead.. words that sounded like noise in Trixie's half-hypnotized ears.. only for Starlight to reach over with a knife produced from behind her back, and cut a rope tied to a belaying pin.

Suddenly, a spare curtain fell down and covered the three of them. This made them stop singing. Trixie staggered to her feet, and cast Levitation on the curtain edge, as Starlight did the same with the other side, and they simply wrapped the three of them up like a mummy.

Coloratura: P> "..they got them, Mister Seeker. We could use some guards back here, though." She was on Starlight's phone.

Trixie staggered over to where they were, shaking her head, trying to clear the fog.

Trixie: "How..?" She leaned on Starlight.

Starlight: "Dusk took the warning seriously. He called me about two hours ago, after asking Astral about the situation - she made a guess that these three were actually Sirens, and I said, that had to be the situation." She shrugged. "So, I came running over here." She smiled.

Dusk, and several members of TacTeam 6 arrived at that point. Weapons raised as they entered the room, Dusk saw what had happeend, and held up a hand for them to stop.

Dusk: "Looks like we got here in time to clean up." He shrugged.

The Dazzlings, meanwhile, expended their energy to start transforming into their Siren Forms.

Dusk: "Oh, no, no. None of that." He pointed to the curtain bundle.

He and the other Guards tackled them, still encased in the curtain, and beat them rather savagely over the head, to knock them all senseless, and unable to resist further. Once done, they cut the curtain aside, yanked the Gems off of them, and got magic restrictor collars around all three. Not just horn rings, full collars were designed for races other than Equestrians, that had magic.

Adagio: "I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!" She screamed.

Trixie: "Believe it." She nodded.

Dance Fever and several other members of the entertainment company arrived about then, and Dusk explained the situation.

Dusk: "Congratulations. Your star band, the Dazzlings, were, in fact, Sirens. And they intended to use Siren music magic to hypnotize Princess Luna and us - and probably the crowd, too, to ruin Coloratura's performance. And chase her out of the industry." He shrugged. "And they're all under arrest." He looked at them. "I'll read you your rights in a minute."

Starlight; "Hey, I helped!" She snorted. "If it wasn't for me getting here when I did, they might've made Trixie hurt herself or something." She poked Dance Fever's chest. "I don't know about you, but this smells like one TARTARUS of a lawsuit, you've got facing you." She smirked a bit. "And I know me a really good Minotauran lawyer."

Dance Fever: "Oh.. THIS IS A DISASTER!" He snorted. "What do we do, now?!" He flapped his arms. "They're the main act besides Color! What.." He looked at Trixie. "Do YOU have any ideas?!" He pointed at her.

Trixie: "AS a matter of fact...." She smirked.
