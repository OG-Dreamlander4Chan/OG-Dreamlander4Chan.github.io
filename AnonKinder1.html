	(Inspired by BGM, Pony Degeneracy)

YOU.. (wait for it).. ARE ANON! Yes, you are the mystery human that keeps getting caught up in zany scenarios about various doings with the world of magical ponies. You are the everyperson.

And you.. happen to have come to Equestria abotu two and a half years ago. Since you had been formerly employed as a Youth Counselor and Sports Coach, Princess Sunnybutt decided to create an after school youth program in Ponyville as a sort of a trial run.

Said after school program would be a mixture of everything. Some days, it was like Gym Class, all focusing on one specific sport. Other days, study hall - and you communicated with Cheerilee to line those up with Test Days, so the fillies can get some extra book-cracking time.

The fillies absolutely adore you. You're like an Uncle to all of them. Most of them have had you over to their house to enjoy dinner. Not one holiday have you gone ignored, as the families of these fillies have seen to it that you're remembered and appreciated.

Be nice to have a girlfriend, though, but, hey, at least the locals don't see you as an alien menace.


It's late fall, and this is the season where sniffles begin. It gets a bit colder around this time, and your activities are curtailed to indoor things like foosball (and boy did you spend a year re-inventing and building a foosball table fit for Ponies!) and story times.

"So, the outbreak.." You were finishing one. "..was contained with this super powerful bomb that erased the whooooole city! And then Jill, along with her friend Barry, and new friend Carlos, swore this evil company, Umbrella, was going to pay. 'That's it!' Jill said. 'Umbrella is going down!'"

The fillies clapped their little hooves together.

Yes, you re-told the story of Resident Evil 3, with a bit less violence, almost no descriptive gore, and spoken more like a great adventure against evil. Basically, you went from Rated R/PEGI 18 to.. ehh.. PG? PG-13?

The fillies loved it.

"Mithter Anon!" Peppermint Twist piped up. "We got time for another thtory?!"

"No, no, Pep." You got up, putting little Noi down. "It's almost 5:30, time for you to all gather your things. Make sure you put your cider cups in the sink, and who's turn is it to collect the popcorn baggies?"

"Mah turn, Mister Anon!" Applebloom put in.

"Okay, get the basket and police up the room." You tousled her hair.

About then, Fluttershy came in, along with Noi's mom.

"Uhm.. Anon?" She motioned for you to come over.

"What's up, Fluttershy?" You tilt your head at the ywllow, quiet one.

"W-Well.. this is Noi's mom. She.. ah.. her little brother Tumbles is sick. She wants Noi to come home and stay away from other fillies for a while, just in case, but-but.. don't make a big deal about it, okay?" She blushed and ducked a bit.

"No problem." You nod, confidently. "Noi? Your mom's here early! Get your stuff, she wants you home ASAP!" You say, very casually.

"Sure, Mister Anon!" She beams and goes to collect her things.

"What's the matter Noi?" Diamond Tiara saunters up to her. "Your mom pulling you out early because she heard you squeaked like a rabbit at recess?" She snorted a tiny bit at her. "And she needs to take you to a dentist to check for buck teeth?"

"Thtop it, Diamond!" Twist cut in.

"Looks like the dentist failed you, Twist." She smirked, as her lackey Silver SPoon giggled behind her. "I suppose there's no fixing YOU."

"HEY! Knock it off, Diamond!" You wag your finger at her from across the room. "You're rich enough to buy a kinder disposition. I know you."

"Soooo-rry Mister Anon!" She sing-songedly chirped back, batting her eyes at you, in a vain attempt at currying favor with her cuteness.

It wouldn't work on you. You just stared at her, nonplussed.

"..sorry, Mister Anon." She said more sincerely, as Noi scampered over to her mom.

"That's better." You nod.

All the kiddos (fillies and colts) were collected in short order. Well, except Scootaloo. As always.

"You ready?" You ask her.

"Yeah! I got everything here." She nodded.

Since her parents had.. well, in your eyes, abandoned her, YOU took responsibility for taking care of her, since they were NEVER around.

For what it matters, Celestia agreed, and even went to the step of what amounts to Civil Asset Forfeiture to give you control of their house in their absence. Whenever they did come home, they'd have a nice Royal surprise of YOU being added to the Deed AND being designated as Scootaloo's legal guardian. They'd not be able to kick you out AND you had a say in her raising.

Take that, absentee parentism!

"Good! Let's swing by Pinkie's - I want to get some Apple Turnovers tomorrow for the group, and I want to make sure I get my order in." You nod, as you depart with her.

"Sounds great!" She beamed a grin. "Thanks.. thanks again.. you know.." She lolled her head off to the side with a little blush. "You're the best Uncle anyone could ever ask for!"

"Even if it's by Royal Decree!" You chuckle to yourself.

Scoots was always so thankful for this. Not a week went by when she didn't give you a piece of art, or something, to show how grateful she was. You also knew that when the time came, she'd see YOU as Grandpa to HER foals, not her two absentee seed-and-egg donors.

After a bit, you get to Sugarcube Corners, and..

"Huh.. they're closed early today." You say, examining the sign. "Wonder why?" And shrug.

"Maybe they ran out of sugar!" Scoots giggled.

"Maybe." You nod. "Come on, let's stop by Rose's and get a pizza for dinner."

"Sure!" Scoots buzzed around you on her scooter, casually.

And with that, you got to the Cafe, only to see that it was.. emptier than usual.

"Rose? You in here?" You slide on in, holding the door for Scoots, who left her scooter parked outside.

"OH! Anonymous!" Came the Manehattan-accented voice of Lilly. "Oh, gawsh! Oiym so glad you're here!" She scooted over to the edge of the counter. "Can'ya do me a fayvah? Be worth a free pizza to'ya!"

"Sure, Lilly, what's up?" You tilt your head, as she slides a large box into your hands. "Oh." You nod. "Delivery. Where's Rose and Daisy?"

"I dunno!" She shrugged. "Daisy didn't show up at awl! An' Rose took off about noon! Said she'd be back, never came back!" She huffed a bit. "I sweayrs! If she's makin' time with that stallion'a hers again, I'll-" She spotted Scootaloo, and covered her mouth, cleared her throat, and corrected herself. "-gives her a stern talkin' to's!"

"No, I get it." You shrug. "Veg-and-Chicken Large, eh? Extra cheese!" And grin.

"Shure!" She slid back to the kitchen.

"Wonder why Rose didn't come back, Uncle?" Scootaloo looked up at you.

"I bet she IS making time with her coltfriend and just lost track of time." You lean down and nudge her a bit. "When you get older, love does funny things." And smirk.

"Pssh! Not me!" She stuck her tongue out.

A bit later, Lilly came back with the pizza. They were take-and-bake, unless you ate at the cafe.

"Here ya goes, Anon! Thaynks again!" She smiled at you, and rather overtly snuck a candy to Scoots.

"No problem, Lilly." You looked at the tag. "Twilight again, eh? That's on the way home. Come on, Scoots." You ignored the candy pass.

With that, you were off. The pizza was atop the package to Twilight. She was probably busy thinking up new spells or something and had lost track of.. what week it was, again. Really, besides getting out with her other five friends for some zany adventures, she was a bit of a shut-in.

"Twilight?" You knock.. no answer. Huh.

"Think she's asleep?" Scoots asked.

"I'll.. check it out." You nod, feeling just a bit uneasy for some reason. "Here, hold the pizza." You pass it to her, and knock again.. louder. "TWILIGHT SPAAARKLE!" You sing-songy the announcement, trying to sound cheerful. "SPIKE!?"

Nothing. Huh. This does not track.

"I hate just walking in uninvited." You shrug, but try the door.

It's locked. THIS. ALSO. DOES NOT TRACK. If Twilight had left on another adventure, she or Spike would leave a note. So.. back to your mis-spent youth! You hop the fence, and go for the back door.

Which.. is also locked.

But, you're out of sight of Scootaloo, so, you bust out your lockpicks and give the lock a poke-and-jiggle. The flimsy lock is no match for your skills, and gives way. When you open the door, though.. it's quiet.

Too quiet.

"Twilight?" You ask the darkness cautiously. "Spike? You in here?" You ask, creeping in.

SOMETHING in your Ancient Monkey Brain screams at you.. something is wrong here, and you should flee.

But, you press on. After all, it would look bad for you to run away when a friend is in danger.

"Twi?" You cut the formalities.. as you get into the main room area.. something stinks. "Twilight?" And you go over to her bed.

Empty! Gone. No sign of her or Spike at all. But, no dust. It wasn't long that they'd been gone, but they were most definitely gone. You even checked the kitchen - the teapot was half full of slightly evaporated tea (showing she'd half finished the pot, then put water in it to rinse it out and forgot it). Just guessing, but it looked like she'd left that morning.

No note, though. This, again, did not track.

So, you left the package where she could find it and exited, re-locking the door in the process.

"She's not home. I left the package where she could find it when she wakes up." You shrug. "Come on, let's get home."

And with that.. you indeed go home. None the wiser to what was going on.

After pizza, you tucked Scoots into bed.

"I'm going to lean on down to Twilight's and see if she got the package. I mean, if there's something perishable inside, I don't want it to spoil." You shrug, snugging Scoots under the covers. "I'll be back."

"Okay! I'll be asleep." She beamed a grin.

And out, you went. Time to see if Twilight was gone for a few days to the palace for some kind of Sunbutt Emergency, or if she just took a day trip.

Back to the Library.. still dark.. you slip back inside. And again, nothing. No sign of her. So, you open the package and make sure nothing in there could spoil. Hmm.. some pie.. chicken.. sundry things. You make sure the food is put up, and leave Twilight a note, then start to make your way back home.

When..

"..STOP!" Came Vigilance's shout - but not at you!

"YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE!" Caramel runs right at you at full gallop.

"ANON! LEND A HOOF!" Calls Copper Top.

You? Stick your leg out. And Caramel tumbles and rolls into a fence. Vigilance is on him in seconds, tying him up, and carrying him off.

"Thanks, Anon." Copper Top nods to you. "We appreciate it."

"What's going on?" You shrug. "Caramel's a good guy. Why're you after him?"

"Oh, don't worry about it." Copper Top shrugs. "Thanks again." And off SHE goes.

What a very strange interaction...


The next day, you get up, get Scoots ready for school, and walk her over there. You notice, though, that there's a slight decrease in hoof traffic? Maybe it's just your imagination. Once you get to the school, though, you DO notice that a couple fewer kids are around.

"Oh, Anonymous!" Cheerilee trotted up to you. "Good to see you." She nodded. "Say, have you seen Silver Spoon?" She tilted her head.

"No.. I try not to." You shrug with a smirk as Scoots joins her friends. "She can be a handful sometimes. Her dad tried to buy me. Like.. like I was a pet." You shrug.

"Oh. Ah, it's probably nothing." She shook her head, and cheerfully went back to her flock.

YOU? Went to Sugarcube Corners. You still wanted those Apple Turnovers.

"..closed again?" You say to yourself, checking the door knob. Yup, locked. Soo.. "Pinkie wouldn't stay put." You nod to yourself, and go around back, then up the back stairs to Pinkie's apartment. "Pinkie!? It's Anon!" You knock, and.. her door isn't locked, so you go in. "Pinkie?"

Empty. No Pinkie Pie. Gone.

This.. does not.. track.

Something mighty strange is going on around here. If Pinkie's gone, then, so are those other four. But, they must've come back later for Fluttershy, since she was in town as late as 5:30. You decide to investigate, since your "job" didn't start until 3:30. So, you go around.. uhmm.. okay, time to find a Pegasus to help.. aha! Mail Mare!

"Derpy?" You chirp to catch her attention.

"OH! Anon!" She sees you from about 30 feet up, then zooms down in a bumblebee-like pattern before screeching to a stop.. kinda next to you. "What's up?" She asks, digging in her mail bag.

"You noticed anything strange going on?" You tilt your head at her.

"Nah." She shrugged her wings. "No more than usual."

"Was Rainbow Dash home when you delivered her mail?" Easier to just ask her.

"I.. don't think so, actually. She's subscribed to Daring Do Magazine, and the latest issue dropped today. She's usually AT the mailbox to get it.." She pondered this, folding a wing to her chin and rubbing it gently. "Strange! I guess there IS something odd going on." She shrugged her wings again. "Welp, I gotta get going! See you later!" One quick hug and she was off.

What a very strange situation!

The Farm was a bit far to hike to without good reason. That meant going to Rarity's. Which was fine - you needed a new pair of pants and some drawers (underware). May as well put in the order. And you DID see Sweetie Belle in the school yard.

Over to the Botique you go!

"Rarity?" You peek your head in.

Opal stands guard. In fact, Opal is guarding her food dish. Someone forgot to feed her.

*Mrow?!* Opal, recognizing the kind and have-hands-that-can-open-catfood-cans Anon, jumps into your arms.

"Heyyy, Opal! Good kitty kitty." You give her some pettin's and go over to the cat food cupboard, snatching a can, and holding it up for her approval. "Salmon?"

*Mrow!* She nodded and rubbed her head on the can, jumping down.

You get the can opener and open it, feeding the kitty.

"RARITY!" You call out, louder. "I fed your cat! Where ARE you?" You ask, disposing of the can in the waste basket, now that it was empty. "Rarity?" You go into her Studio.. and she, too, is gone.

So very, very strange.

So, Twilight, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash were confirmed to be MIA.

None of this tracks.

So, you take the hour or so journey to Fluttershy's place. Angel wasn't perfect with communication, but he'd at least tell you if she had to leave on Royal orders or some emergency or something. You didn't expect-

"OH! Anon!" She fluttered over to you, from her garden. "I.. uhm.. didn't expect to see you." She blushed a tiny bit.

"..Fluttershy?" You tilt your head. "Do you know where Twilight, Pinkie, and Dash are?"

"Huh?" She looked confused. "Aren't they at home? Or in town?"

"No.. I thought you all had ended up going on an adventure or something." You shrug. "I don't think they'd leave you behind."

"No. I don't THINK so.." She lowered her head a bit, then looked up. "We should go see Applejack."

"Sounds like we need to!" You nod.

Getting to AJ's place was.. a trip. Another hour and change. It was getting towards noon, and you were starting to want lunch. Granny would likely drag you to the table and feed you both, so you weren't worried.

Until you saw the sign.

-COME NO FURTHER!-

"That's so strange!" Fluttershy hmm'd.

"That's Granny's penponyship." You nodded. "Well.. it's clear they don't want visitors." You shrug. "Come on, let's get back to town."

"Don't you want to.. check it out?" She looked at you with expectation.

"I'm not Twilight. It'd be rude." You shrug back, and turn around, and started walking.

"You know, I suppose you're right." She hmm'd again, somewhat assertively. "Twilight can be a bit.. pushy." She frowned momentarily.

You got back to town, and about three quarters of the way, split off from Fluttershy. You just went home and made lunch for yourself, then whipped up some simple garlic knots for the kids this afternoon. Only, replace garlic, with 'cinnamon-sugar, creme, apple, and whatever's at hand.'

Back to the school by.. 3:25! Cutting it close with today's investigation.

"Hey, kids!" You use your butt to get the door open, turn around and see...

Peppermint Twist.

Scootaloo.

Sweetie Belle.

Diamond Tiara.

Archer.

Liza Doolots.

And that's it. Out of what is usually 18 students, you have six.

And.. Cheerilee isn't there to greet you.

You set the Garlic Knots down and the other things you have, on the table, realizing, also, they hadn't greeted you in the cheerful manner they normally did.

They were all staring at you. On the verge of tears.

"What's going on?" You look at Scoots.

"Uncle! P-Ponies.. just started vanishing! One at a time! Applebloom was here at the beginning of first recess, and then she vanished!" She quivered.

"And Silver Spoon never even CAME to school!" Even Diamond Tiara was upset and pouting.

"Then, Mithus Play Write went mithing around lunch!" Twist chimed in.

"And Miss Cheerilee stepped out right.. like.. an HOUR before the end'a school an' never came back!" Sweetie Belle added.

"My big brother's missing, but I'm still here." Archer contributed.

"Liza?" You tilt your head at her.

Liza, who HAD been facing away, turned back towards everyone, with the most haunting look you'd ever seen from a pony, let alone a Filly.

"They're coming!" She hissed.

"Who?! Who's coming?" You ask her.

"THEY. THEM." She stared lasers into your eyes. "It's.. an OUTBREAK!"

"Eh?" You cock a brow. "What do you mean?"

"AN OUTBREAK, ANON!" She raised her voice. "An outbreak of the shamblers! The eaters! And they're coming to take us away! THEM are! The.. the.. ones like Nurse Redheart! They're going to take us away so we don't shamble around and eat everyone!" She hugged herself.

MAYBE TELLING THAT RESIDENT EVIL STORY WAS A BAD IDEA!

"Oh, that's silly, Liza! That's.. nothing like that.." You start saying, turning to face the window. "..would ever.." And see a Pony in Hazmat Gear dragging a small foal away. "..happen here."

And blink.

"OKAY KIDS! Time to play Hide-and-don't-get-found!" You say, but you don't have to. The kids are already whining and scampering into cupboards and any other hidey hole they can find.

You? Find your lumber. That is, your Louisville Slugger that came with you to Equestria. This baby got you a home run in College! Time to take out the trash.

"The thamblers are gonna thamble uth, an' the other ponies gonna take uth away!" Twist whined as she slid the cabinet door closed.

"I mean.. I'd sure like to know what's going on.." You say.

Then, you think about it. The missing ponies. Caramel being roughed up last night. The sign at Sweet Apple Acres. It.. frighteningly made sense. Even Fluttershy. She was far enough from town that she'd likely not be in much danger, no matter what this was. And it would fit for Princess Sunbutt to contact her Student directly and have her discreetly evacuate her most trusted friends.

Sweetie Belle being left behind? Didn't make all that much sense. Neither did leaving Opal behind. Unless, they planned to come BACK. With force. Explaining the Hazmat Pony.

You needed answers. And you needed to protect these ki-

"ANON!" Fluttershy zoomed into the classroom, shut the door, pulled the shades, and hid under Cheerilee's desk.

"..yes, Fluttershy?" You cock your head at her, seeing she was hugging Scoots.

"S-S-Something really s-s-strange is happening out there! I-I've never seen ponies wearing things like that b-before!" She was terrifed.

"It'll be okay, Fluttershy, I promise you." You lean in and pet her mane a bit.. and it took a few minutes, but she did calm down. "I'm going out there to take a look, okay? Stay here and watch the kids. And lock the doors."

"O-Ohkay.. Anon.." She looked down, blushed, then leaned up and pecked you on the cheek. "F-For good luck!"

Good luck. Yeah. It made YOU blush. The first female attention since you got here? Oh, yeah. And from the sweetest, kindest Mare of them all.

It also gave you a bit of a confidence boost. You smirk a bit, unable to contain it. You feel like you can do anything, now.

"Alright, I'll be back once I get some answers." You nod, and depart.

As planned, Fluttershy seals up the school behind you. Not wanting to get spotted, you get into the bushes, and start making your way towards the town's center. You can see, every now and then, another Hazmat Pony hanging around. Not MANY of them - less than a dozen - but enough.

Finally, you make your way into Rose's Cafe. Only to find it abandoned. Save for ONE little colt...

<audio controls src="HeyWait.mp3"></audio>

"Hey there, kiddo! Hang in there." He looked very scared. "Why isn't someone doing something about this?" You weren't necessarily asking him, but it WAS a question.

"Oh! I didn't know you were still alive, Mister Anon!" He clutched his school bag in front of him. "No one's trained to handle this kinda situation.. what could ANYONE do!?" He whined, then looked at you with a very serious face. "Listen.. he's coming for us. We're both gonna DIE!"

"WHAT are you SAYING!?" Your voice was more of concern than fear.

"You'll see! He's after Foals! There's no ESCAPE!" He said, climbing up to a window ledge.

"HEY, WAIT!" You call to him.

He scooted out the window before you could stop him.

Why WASN'T someone doing something? Who WERE the Hazmat Ponies? Where the hell was the Royal Guard? Who was the one after the fillies and colts?! What was this.. this outbreak?

You didn't know. But you would find out.

After a very convoluted trip, you managed to get to City Hall, all the time, avoiding these Hazmat Ponies (not that you saw many, and you're certain you saw the same ones more than once). You didn't see any "sick" ponies, though.. that worried you.

At City Hall, you caught up to that Colt from before.

"Hey, Kiddo!" You approach him, but he looks terrified.

"MISTER ANON! WE GO-" He was cut off.

A large minotaur in Hazmat gear lept the fence and got between you.

"AAAAAAAH! MISTER ANON! HEEEEEEEEEEELP!" He screamed, and instantly cowered, his legs betraying him and turned to quivering jelly.

"GET AWAY FROM HIM!" You yell, and charge up to the Minotaur (who's about your height), buffalo'ing him with a Line Drive swing right to the dome.

He goes down, but to his hands and knees. He turned to look at you, and you see his muscles tense. That's enough excuse for you to take another swing, landing between his horns. He flops to his belly, knocked clean out.

"You okay, kid?" You say, moving quickly over to him - you knew that Minotaur wouldn't be down long.

"I-I-I-I.. PEED MYSELF!" He whines and cries.

You just pick him up, tuck him into your gym bag, and head inside. Once inside the City Hall building, you move a bench to block the doors. That Minotaur wasn't getting in here so easily. You hoped Mayor Mare would have some answers.

If she was even still here.

If she wasn't a zombie.

NO-NO-NO! That's just CRAZY! Zombies? Nahh. Impossible. You hadn't seen ONE sick pony yet.

"Th-th-that thing.. gonna git us.." The colt cried.

"No it's not." You nod, mounting the steps.

It didn't take but a moment to get to Mayor Mare's office. You knock. Still civil.

"OH! Come in!" You hear her reply.

And you RUSH inside, LOCK the door behind you, then ZOOM over to the Mayor's desk.

"Mayor Mare! W-"

"ANON!" She looked harshly at you. "It's you! We've been LOOKING for you, you know!" She snorted. "You just stay RIGHT there!" She pointed a hoof at you. "We have someone that can deal with you!"

"Oh, it's like that, is it?" You shrug, then RUN FOR THE WINDOW!

"MISTER ANON! EEEEEEEEEEEEE!" Squealed the colt.

You? Pop the window open, and start climbing the side of the building. They weren't going to get you. No, no, no.. someone to deal with you? What was going ON here?! Why was the MAYOR in on it!?

You climbed up to the City Hall roof. Boy, you needed to get somewhere safe!

*URROOOH!*

That.. would be the Minotaur. You look down, and it's scaling the building by brute force.

"MISTER ANON! WE'RE DONE FOR!" Squealed the Colt.

"Not on my watch!" You say, dashing across the roof, sliding down the back of the dome, and jumping from the 1st floor roof to the ground behind the building.

Time to run.

Just fucking run.

Into the woods. No, don't double back. Don't lead them to the rest of the kids. Keep going. The colt in your gym bag was crying his little eyes out, and you didn't blame him. Eventually, you got partway into Everfree Forest, and stopped. You KNEW you were further in than any Pony would willingly go (except Fluttershy).

"Sheesh!" You sit on a log. "You okay, kiddo?"

"I'm alright, Mister Anon!" *hic* Poor kid cried so hard, he has the hiccups.

It's also almost nighttime.

"We need to find somewhere safe for the night, kid. No chance us going back to town." You nod.

"No kidding!" He whined.

"I think Fluttershy's cabin is near here." You nod, thinking about it. It would kinda mean doubling back a bit, but at an angle. Hopefully, that Minotaur wouldn't know where it was.

"Better'n nothin'!" He sighed.

So.. the journey to Fluttershy's cabin.. just as uneventful as your trip around town, but no sign of any HazMat Ponies. By the time you get there, it's dark outside. So, you slip in carefully.

"Angel!" You hiss. "It's Anon!"

Angel Bunny pops up from behind a pillow, and sheathes the kitchen knife he was carrying. He gives you an affirmative nod and motions for you to get inside quickly.

You do just that, closing the door and quietly locking it.

"Angel. You have any idea what's going on?" You ask the bun-fluff.

He shrugs and shakes his head, but then points to Opal, and Gummy, both taking shelter in here as well. Opal bounds over to you, and rubs up under your chin.

"Hey, Opal." You give her a quick pet, and get the little Colt out from your Gym Bag, and set him on Fluttershy's bed.

"Thanks, Mister Anon!" He curls up, wiping the dried tears from his face.

"No problem, kiddo." You shrug.

After taking a wet rag and cleaning up the poor kid, you get him something to eat - Fluttershy really only had vegetables and hay in stock, fitting with her preferred Vegetarian diet. She did have some kippered fish for her Ferret friends. You have some of that, and some salad.

"I'm really confused about all this." You shrug. "The Elements of Harmony should be doing something." And shake your head.

"I dunno either! All's I knows is they keep kidnapping Foals an' takin' us away!" He huffed.

"Yeah, well, we better get some rest, too. After a bit, I'm going to try and sneak back to the Schoolhouse and rescue the other foals that are there." You nod.

"Okay, Mister Anon. I'll be safe here, right?" He asked, weakly.

"Angel will see to it." You nod.

Angel crossed his arms, and nodded, then side-nodded to the knife across his back.

After about three hours, you move. It takes roughly an hour to sneak back towards the town. You can just FEEL that Minotaur skulking around. The same dozen-or-so Hazmat ponies were still milling about, too. Finally, you manage to sneak over to the school house.. and see what you didn't want to.

The front door was busted in.

Trying not to panic, you sneak in, and get into the classroom you'd hidden the kids in.

Gone. All of them.

You hoped they were alright. You hoped FLUTTERSHY was alright. Maybe you should have kissed her back, for luck?

You made sure to check every cabinet and cupboard.. nothing.

Well. Time to see if you could find anypony alive, besides the Hazmat Ponies.

You really were confused about all of this. Just in case, you'd stop by your house. That didn't take long to get to. You actualy snuck in your own window.

And you'd get thumped by hooves. Soft, panicky hooves.

"NO-NO-NO!" Fluttershy squealed.

"Fluttershy!" You wrap your arms around her. "It's me! Anon!"

"OH!" She blinked, then blushed, realizing you were holding her.

"JUTHT KITHH ALREADY!" Twist piped up from the back.

You shrug.. and do exactly that, giving Fluttershy a kiss right on the lips. It.. it felt good to have her in an embrace. It felt.. right.

She blushed deeply. She felt it, too.

"So, ah.. what.. what happened?" You finally ask, after a moment.

"Weelll.. those strange ponies in those wierd suits came around the school house, so, we booked it out the back." Scootaloo said, shrugging. "I wanted to beat 'em up, though."

"Yeah, I met a little Colt out there that was being chased by a Minotaur - you know, like Iron Will?" I tilted my head.

"O-Oh, yes.." Fluttershy was still blushing. "Ah.. I kept the foal safe."

"You did great, Fluttershy." You cuddle her a bit. "I left the foal at your place, with Angel, Gummy, and Opal." You nod to Sweetie Belle, and she seemed relieved.

"What's going on? Did y-you find anything out?" Fluttershy asked.. not.. quite wanting you to let go.

"I have no idea, but the Mayor is in on it, whatever it is." You shrug.

"Oh, no." She frowned. "And with Twilight and the others gone.. and Applejack at Sweet Apple Acres..!" She blinked. "I-I'm.. in charge?" She asked you.

"Kinda. You are one of the Elements." You nod to her, and give her a quick peck on the forehead, before releasing her, finally.

"O-Oh.." She blinked a few times, thinking. "Maybe we should all hide at my cottage. There's lots of little nooks and crannies we can hide the foals in." She nods.

"Sounds like a plan. There's only about a dozen of those Suited-Up Ponies around, so, I think we can evade them." You shrug. "Come on. Let's give it a go. Kids? Grab some food and a couple extra blankets." You direct.

"Sure, Anon!" Archer nodded firmly, and went digging for things.

"I wonder what thith ith!" Twist piped up. "It'th tho thcary!"

"We'll be fine!" Sweetie Belle beamed. "Anon'n'Fluttershy're with us!" She seemed confident. "An' I'm sure my big sis'll come save us!"

"I'm sure she will." You pet her head.

After gathering supplies, you get the kids huddled together into a little cohesive group, and make sure they understand that they NEED to stick together..

"No Foal left behind, got it?" You wag your finger at them.

"We'll be okay, Mister Anon." Diamond Tiara nodded firmly. "Someone has to make sure! And that'll be me!"

"That's very brave of you, Diamond." You smile at her, taking a leadership role like this.

"I got to!" She slung Sweetie Belle and Scootalo under her forelegs. "NO ONE gets to push these two around but me!" She gave a cheeky grin.

"I'll take it!" Scoots giggled.

Ah, yes, the old Arch Nemesis's creed - none shall fell the Heroes but them. Even if that means risking your own neck to preserve the honor.

That, or, in this case, Diamond was actually feeling vulnerable without Silver Spoon and was reaching out for friends.. seeking forgiveness and redemption.. in the face of danger.

You got the group together, you in front, Fluttershy in back, and started creeping your way towards the edge of town.. you weren't quite sure where all those HazMat Ponies were, but you did manage to avoid at least two. The foals were staying quiet, at least.

Everything was fine until you were past the Library..

*UHROOAH!*

"AH! SHIT! That's that Minotaur!" You say, out loud. "That sound could've come from anywhere around here.. kids, get ready to run!" You harshly whisper at them.

After all, you knew it was vulnerable to baseball bats. No way you were letting it have the kids.

You crept forwards, now angling almost straight out of town. As you passed Golden Harvest's carrot cart, though, the Minotaur struck. He lifted the cart straight off the ground, and tossed it aside.

"RUN, KIDS! RUN!" You point.

"COME ON, EVERYPONY!" Fluttershy squealed, extending her wings like arms, and herding them away.

You? You take that baseball bat and CRACK that Minotaur in the ribs as hard as you can. That makes him double over, but not fall. You follow this up with a swift kick to the Taurines (bull balls) so hard, you hurt your toes. THAT sent him to the ground. For good measure, you crack him over the dome again, and book it!

You run to catch up to the kids, and see several of the HazMat ponies were trying to chase them, but having little luck. As you caught up to one, you dome it with the bat, flattening them to the ground.

"DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY!" One of them yells.

"I GOT ONE!" One of them dives on Scootaloo.

"NO YOU DON'T!" Diamond Tiara charged forwards! She wheeled around and mule kicked the offending HazMat Pony in the head! "RUN, SCOOTALOO!" And followed that up with a cartwheel into a somersault kick on another one.

She landed on your shoulders as you continued to run. The kids re-coallesced into a gaggle together as you made your way through back yards, and side alleyways.

Finally, you managed to elude your pursuers, and get outside of the town.. and still run another 15 minutes into the wilderness just on fear adrenaline alone.

Then, you stop for a breather.

"Thanks, Diamond!" Scoots finally says. "You saved my life!"

"Eh, it was nothing. Daddy wanted me to study Karate, since a gorgeous debutant like me! Might have a few uncouth suitors.." She smiled smugly, then slid off your shoulders, and went and hugged Scootaloo. "I mean it, though. N-No one.."

"You wanna be friends?" Scoots asked.

"..yeah!" Diamond Tiara pulled away with a HUGE smile and tears in her eyes. She wiped them away, and shook hooves. "Forever."

"Aw.. that's so nice!" Fluttershy hmm'd.

"Shared danger can bring out the best in people." You explain to her. "Come on, Kids. We got some walking to do."

Yeah, and it'd be longer, with the kids along. But, you press on. After another 30 minutes, you were certain you'd evaded your pursuers, and finally relaxed a bit.

"So, Fluttershy, that was very brave of you." You slide up along side her, and stroke her mane a bit. "Getting the kids together and getting them away from danger."

"O-Oh..!" She blushed. "Th-thank you."

"You're tougher than you think you are. So, how about I take you on a proper date after this?" You smirk.

"Sure!" She beamed, and blushed. "I-I mean.. I'd really like that, Anon.." And kinda looked away a little.

"I.. didn't want to.. you know.. we're different species and all.. I didn't think you'd like me." You blush, this time.

"O-Oh! Well.. I always thought you were handsome.. and.. uhm.. I thought the same thing! That.. you'd only like other humans.. and.." She flushed deeply.

"You two thould get married!" Twist piped in.

"Maybe some day." You grin.

"Maybe?!" She almost froze up at the idea, and her face was as red as a tomato.

It took more than an hour and a half to get to the Cabin, and once you did, the foals filed in and all started finding places to get comfortable. Most of them piled into the bed. Archer slid into an open drawer. Liza Doolots got UNDER the bed. Diamond Tiara got her comb and brush from her saddlebags and started preening Scoots and Sweetie Belle.

You? Got into the easy chair. You were TIRED.

"That.. was a long day." Fluttershy put in, just crawling into your lap.

"It sure was. Hopefully, tomorrow, we can get some answers." You shrug a bit.

"..thanks for everything, Anon. I-I don't know what would've happend without you." She nuzzled your neck.

You just slept. All of you. Exhausted and worn through. The poor foals were pooped, too.

You were nervous, though, even with the most comforting mare in your lap. The dreams that night were fitful and concerned.

When morning came, as it eventually did, Fluttershy set about making breakfast for the kids. You helped. As you did so, you could feel yourself tugged towards thoughts domestic. Like, how good it would be to have her as a wife and mother. The little colt from earlier seemed to be rather attached to her, too.

It was a wonderful thought.

After breakfast, though, you decided on a plan.

"..and I don't care how far it is, I need to get to Canterlot." You nod. "You and the kids can run into the forest if you need to. I know you know your way around and how to stay safe in there."

"I-I do..!" She nodded. "And I have lots of forest friends that will help me!" She beamed.

"Right. Canterlot is.. about a full day's walk and change from here, but I can get to the next town over and take the train, I guess." You shrug. "No big deal."

"And when you get to Celestia?" Fluttershy asked.

"I'll get some answers." You nod firmly.

"Alright." She paused.. then leaned up and kissed you good and proper! "S-S-Stay safe! I.. I can't exactly get a date with you if something happens to you!" She blinked away tears of concern.

"I'm callin' it now!" Twist piped in again. "Theth two're thtuck to each other like glue!"

"Even I have to admit.. they're like a set of matched earrings!" Diamond Tiara giggled.

"Thanks, kids. Now, be good for Fluttershy. I'll be back as soon as possible!" You nod.

"YES MISTER ANON!" They all cheer.

And, off you go...

You make it to the town of Coxsaddle by nightfall. A long trip, and you're worried about the foals and Fluttershy. No one in Coxsaddle seems worried about you being there, and neither of the two cops in town cared that you walked right past them. After all, being the only human in the world, you would attract attention.

That told you, that whatever was happening in Ponyville, was restricted to Ponyville.

You hop the last train to the Capital. You knew, though, that you'd end up having to see Luna - Sunbutt would be asleep by the time you got there. Despite being amped up on stress and adrenaline, you force yourself to eat on the train. Distracted, you nearly order hay, but settle on potato soup.

Three hours later, at 9PM, you arrive at the Capital, Canterlot. Unsure if the Royal Guards were "in on it" or not, you elect to sneak onto the palace grounds, again taking advantage of your misspent youth, and scale the side of the castle, and into Luna's personal quarters via her balcony.

"Princess Luna?" You hop down, and she's sitting at her desk, drinking coffee.

"ANON!?" She was shocked to see you. "W-What are you doing here!?"

"Relax! I came to get some answers! Strange things are happening in Ponyville, an-"

"Princess?!" Twilight came almost rushing into the room. "Are you o-" She blinked, seeing you. "HOW did YOU escape containment?!"

"Containment!?" You flap your arms. "You mean you guys are behind those ponies in protective gear?!" You demand, shocked.

"YES!" Luna answered, scooting a bit away from you. "You mean, you don't know?!"

"Know WHAT?! I don't know anything, other than I spent a day getting chased around with a gaggle of terrified foals and Fluttershy!" You snort at them.

"Fluttershy, too!?" Twilight gasped. "I.. we.. we thought she'd say outside town!"

"Okay, okay, okay.." You wave your arms. "Everyone, start at the beginning."

"Alright, Anon." Luna nodded. "It started three days ago. One of the kids in town came down with Pony Pox." She shrugged. "Usually, this isn't a big deal, but then it spread, since a LOT of the kids and even some adults hadn't gotten it.. you know, you get it as a foal, and then you spread it to other foals, so everyone gets a chance to get sick, so they don't get it as adults?" She nodded. "Anyway, the last couple generations hadn't had any Pony Pox! So, some adults were starting to get sick with it. Tia and I decided to quarantine the town for a few days. She called Twilight here to help coordinate everything, since she knows the town so well. And the others, too." She shrugged her wings. "We didn't know.. well.. if you can catch it or not, or if you've had Pox before or what.. so.. we sent Steel Arms in there to grab you."

"A minotaur." You state.

"Yes," Luna acknowledged. "And grab as many foals as possible. They're all at Ponyville Hospital! Everyone's fine! We're just trying to make sure everyone that needs to, gets exposed, then gets proper care!" She sighed. "Are you familiar with Herd Immunity?"

"I am." You shrug, and sit on her bed. "Also, if this is related to Chicken Pox, I had that as a kid." And shake your head. "Man, this is insane. All this over Pony Pox? Man, I was SOOOO off base!" You laugh a bit. "I thought those HazMat Ponies were taking us off to a lab or.. well, the kids thought they were going to die!" And laugh harder. "Boy, I feel like a complete jerk, a-"

Steel Arms came in at that point, bandaged up, arm in a sling.

"HI.. uhhhh... I'm sorry?" You shrug. "It was a misunderstanding!"

"It was, Steel." Luna nodded to him.

"Well. At least I can shake your hand. I didn't think you'd be so tough!" He chuckled a bit. "Also, I'm going to need.. six weeks paid vacation to heal the broken bones." He frowned.

"You'll have it!" Twilight put in.

"I suppose I should lead everyone back to town and show you all where the.. LAST SURVIVORS are hidden, yeah?" You ask.

"Yeah." Twilight nodded. "In the morning."

So, in the early morning, you caught a train with Twilight and the rest of the girls back to town with a few Royal Guards that were cleared to enter the area. Fluttershy's cabin was.. heh.. reinforced.

"Fluttershy! Come on out, it's okay!" You call to her.

"Fluttershy!" Rainbow Dash yelled. "COME ON!"

She came out, timidly, with the little colt from earlier, then, seeing you, buzzed the deck to tackle-hug you. Given the lack of mass and low velocity, you manage to catch her and hug her.

"It's all a misunderstanding. This is just a bad outbreak of Pony Pox!" You laugh.

"Is that all!?" She asks, shrugging her wings. "Oh, well." And blinks. "O-Oh.. are you still up for that date? O-Or do you want to skip right to.. the wedding?" She blushed DEEPLY and nuzzled into your neck, and you met that with a kiss...

"WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!" The other five girls yelled in unison!

So, that's how you led a successful resistance to an occupation, evaded a 'monster,' and met the mare of your dreams, amidst an 'outbreak' of some horrible disease.

What's next? That's a story for another time!
